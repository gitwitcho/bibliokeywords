Various factors were compared between the 2 groups, including age, sex, glaucoma type, previous intraocular surgery, preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), refractive error, axial length, anesthesia, and systemic risk factors such as history of diabetes, hypertension, medication, and a laboratory examination including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).Purpose: To evaluate the risk factors for decompression retinopathy after glaucoma surgery.Results: The proportion of eyes with decompression retinopathy was 3.05% (21 of 688 eyes), and 50 control eyes were selected randomly. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in age, systemic disease, glaucoma type, anesthesia, or the incidence rate of postoperative hypotony. Preoperative maximum IOP and the change of IOP was higher (P=0.016, 0.019), PT and aPTT was prolonged (P=0.001, 0.006), and hemoglobin and hematocrit level was lower in patients with decompression retinopathy (P=0.005, 0.002). Preoperative maximum IOP and hemoglobin showed a significant association with the development of decompression retinopathy in a multivariate analysis (P=0.031, 0.040). No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups for IOP and visual acuity 6 months postoperatively.Conclusions: Patients with high preoperative IOP and hematologic abnormalities have a higher risk for developing decompression retinopathy. Surgeons should carefully assess the potential risks and pay close attention to sufficiently decrease IOP preoperatively.

Frequently, these actors are human agents, such as rogue traders or aggressive financial innovators, terrorists, groups of dissidents, or unauthorized sources of sensitive or secret information about government or private sector activities. In other instances, influential ""actors"" take the form of climate change, communications technologies, or socioeconomic globalization. Although these individual forces may be small relative to state governments or international institutions, or may operate on long time scales, the changes they catalyze can pose significant challenges to the analysis and practice of international relations through the operation of complex feedbacks and interactions of individual agents and interconnected systems. We call these challenges ""femtorisks,"" and emphasize their importance for two reasons. First, in isolation, they may be inconsequential and semiautonomous; but when embedded in complex adaptive systems, characterized by individual agents able to change, learn from experience, and pursue their own agendas, the strategic interaction between actors can propel systems down paths of increasing, even global, instability. Second, because their influence stems from complex interactions at interfaces of multiple systems (e.g., social, financial, political, technological, ecological, etc.), femtorisks challenge standard approaches to risk assessment, as higher-order consequences cascade across the boundaries of socially constructed complex systems. We argue that new approaches to assessing and managing systemic risk in international relations are required, inspired by principles of evolutionary theory and development of resilient ecological systems.","Complex adaptive systems; Contagion; Resilience; Risk analysis; Systemic risk","Arab; Article; authority; biological model; climate change; coping behavior; decision making; economics; environmental change; femtorisk; financial deficit; government; homicide; human; international relations; kidnapping; policy; risk; risk assessment; spring; Ukraine; war; winter","Frank, A.B.; Department of Computational Social Science, George Mason UniversityUnited States",,"National Academy of Sciences",00278424,,PNASA,,"English","Proc.

The framework models investment funds' distress dependence explicitly and captures the time-varying non-linearities and feedback effects typical of financial markets. It measures investment funds' systemic credit risk in three forms: (1) credit risk common to all funds within each of the seven categories the Eurosystem reports to the ECB; (2) credit risk in each category of investment fund conditional on distress on another category of investment fund and; (3) the buildup of investment funds' vulnerabilities over time which may unravel disorderly. In addition, the estimates of the common components of the investment funds' distress measures contain early warning features, and the identification of their drivers is useful for macroprudential policy. The ranking of drivers of those common components in terms of importance differs from the ranking of the drivers of the common components of marginal measures of distress.

While industrial accidents such as oil spills can erode consumers’ trust in experts, a macrolevel analysis reveals that media coverage of such events ultimately contains the anxieties that are sparked by initial news coverage. The brandcentric disaster myths generated by media coverage frame public discourse in ways that help to reestablish consumers’ trust in expert systems while also insulating corporations and governmental institutions from more systematic critiques. This analysis contributes to a macrolevel theorization of the institutional and ideological structures that shape consumers’ risk perceptions and just world beliefs. It also extends prior accounts of cultural branding by identifying a set of ideological effects that operate in concert with the more commonly discussed therapeutic benefits afforded by marketplace myths. © 2014 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.

The conducted analyses reveal that there is a subset of financial institutions that act as money centres. The local importance of financial institutions is moderately concentrated and assumes increased values between 2006 and 2011. Moreover, we investigate the impact that default of institutions cause on their neighbourhood and also find the most probable contagion paths within the banking system. The contagion paths change over time, but the network's central institutions remain the same. In order to assess the systemic impact of the banks' defaults, we simulate default cascades and complement the results with liquidity and solvency stress measures. We find that failure cascades hardly happen. When they do occur, the average propagation chain's length is very short. We also do not find any significant stress measure associated with banks' defaults. As a consequence, we do not find evidence of significant systemic risk associated with the BPS. Finally, we extract topological information of the network's structure by using several network measures, such as ones related to centrality and degree correlation. The extracted information is relevant for monitoring the financial stability and for understanding, in an intuitive way, many structural characteristics of the investigated network. © The authors 2014.","Complex networks; Contagion path; Payments system; Systemic risk","Complex networks; Contagion path; Degree correlation; Financial institution; Financial stability; Payments system; Structural characteristics; Systemic risks; Topological information; Finance","Stancato de Souza, S.R.; Research Department, Brazil; email: sergio.souza@bcb.gov.br",,"Oxford University Press",20511310,,,,"English","J.

In contrast, international monetary and financial law is still emerging as a discipline within IEL. With the exception of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), international monetary and financial law is still characterized by the predominance of soft law, soft obligations, and an informal institutional structure. Financial markets have become much more international in recent decades, while their regulation, supervision and - if necessary - resolution remain constrained by the domain of domestic jurisdictions. The global financial crisis has taught us several lessons. One of them is that banking crises often lead to sovereign debt crises because of the vicious link between bank debt and sovereign debt (the so-called 'doom loop', the catalyst for the adoption of banking union in the EU). Another lesson is that financial institutions retrench to national frontiers when things turn sour (they live globally, but die nationally). This state of affairs has to change if financial institutions and markets can remain credibly global. It is urgent and important to devise adequate international structures and international norms to govern financial markets and to control systemic risk in finance. The debate about the need for a World Financial Organization ought to be understood in this context. © 2014 © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

To assess this risk, we consider three decades of data on the cross-border interbank market. We use Rosvall and Bergstrom's (2008) information theoretic map equation to partition banking groups from 21 countries into modules that reveal the contagious capacity of the network. We show that in the late 1980s four important financial centers formed one large super cluster that was highly contagious in terms of transmission of stress within its ranks, but less contagious on a global scale. But the expansion leading to the 2008 crisis left more transmitting hubs sharing the same total influence as a few large modules had previously. We show that this greater entanglement meant the network was more broadly contagious, and not that risk was more shared. Thus, our analysis contributes to our understanding as to why defaults in US sub-prime mortgages spread quickly through the global financial system. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Information theory; Interconnectedness; Network analysis; Systemic risk",,"Mahadeva, L.; Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, A Recognised Independent Centre of the University of OxfordUnited Kingdom",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

We find that stock returns exhibit strong loss dependence even in their limiting joint extremes. Motivated by this result, we derive extremal dependence-based systemic risk indicators. The proposed systemic risk indicators reflect downturns in the US financial industry very well. We also develop a set of firm-level average extremal dependence measures. We show that these firm-level measures could have been used to identify the firms that were more vulnerable to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Additionally, we explore the performance of selected systemic risk indicators in predicting the crisis performance of large US depository institutions and find that the average stock return correlations are also good predictors of crisis period returns. Finally, we identify factors predictive of extremal dependence for the US depository institutions in a panel regression setting. Strength of extremal dependence increases with asset size and similarity of financial fundamentals. On the other hand, strength of extremal dependence decreases with capitalization, liquidity, funding stability and asset quality.

This article reviews the central issues surrounding the role bank capital plays in financial stability. Because the socially efficient capital level may exceed banks' privately optimal capital levels, regulatory capital requirements become germane.But such requirements may entail various bank-level and social costs. Thus, despite agreement that higher capitalwould enhance banking stability, recognition of these costs has generated theoretical disagreement over whether capital requirements should be higher. Empirical evidence reveals that, in the cross section of banks, higher capital is associated with higher lending, higher liquidity creation, higher bank values, and higher probabilities of surviving crises. Moreover, increases in capital requirements are met with modest declines in lending. The overarching message from research is that lower capital in banking leads to higher systemic risk and a higher probability of a government-funded bailout that may elevate government debt and trigger a sovereign debt crisis. Thus, capital regulation reform, as well as tax policy, should seek to increase bank capital. This article discusses the contemporary thinking on these issues and concludes with open research questions. Copyright © 2014 by Annual Reviews.

Substance-dependent mothers face unique challenges in caring for an infant while managing drug use or pharmacotherapy. The vulnerability of infancy therefore requires thorough assessment of risk and a prompt response from service providers. Drawing upon a prospective case-study of twenty women accessing a specialist alcohol and other drug obstetric service, this article explores the factors which contributed to infant risk or safety from the perinatal period to the end of the infant's first year. Data sources included structured interviews with counsellors and child protection workers and semi-structured interviews with mothers. The findings demonstrate continuing exposure to risk identified in pregnancy, including substance use and domestic violence, and inadequate follow-up of infants after discharge from hospital. The ability of an obstetric provider to conduct accurate risk assessment was evident. In addition, a sub-group of infants at higher risk of removal from maternal care was identified. The argument is made for a differential response by the service system to ensure women in greatest need are provided with extensive support when infants are most vulnerable and mothers most open to help. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Child protection; Domestic violence; Infants; Substance-dependence",,"Tsantefski, M.; Department of Social Work, School of Health Sciences, The University of MelbourneAustralia",,"Elsevier Ltd",01907409,,CYSRD,,"English","Child.

On the other side, portfolio diversification acts to mitigate these losses. Systemic risk results from correlations between individual default probabilities that cannot be considered independent. Based on the structural framework by Merton (1974), we propose a model in which these correlations arise from overlaps in banks' portfolios. Our main result is the finding of a critical level of diversification that separates two regimes: (i) a safe regime in which a properly chosen diversification strategy offsets the higher systemic risk engendered by increased leverage and (ii) a risky regime in which an inadequate diversification strategy and/or adverse market conditions, such as market size, market volatility and time horizon, cannot compensate the same increase in leverage.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is a potential systemic risk of topical steroid use. Our aim was to review available data on the risk of HPA axis suppression associated with long-term topical steroid use and to distinguish between pathologic and physiologic adrenal suppression. Methods: We performed a PubMed search for literature that evaluated the risk of HPA axis suppression associated with topical steroid use. Results: Fifteen of sixteen clinical trials reviewed did not report any pathologic adrenal suppression. In the single clinical trial that reported pathologic adrenal suppression, the patients used twice the maximum recommended amount of clobetasol propionate continuously for as long as 18 months. Physiologic adrenal suppression was seen as early as 1-2 weeks after treatment with class I-IV topical corticosteroids. In about half of these patients, cortisol levels spontaneously returned to normal within a few weeks, despite continuous therapy. Conclusion: Even when adrenal suppression occurs, topical corticosteroids are unlikely to be associated with clinical signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression and are extremely safe as long as they are used within the current safety guidelines. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Increasing the resilience of existing livelihoods to such climate changes is considered as a key strategy for adaptation. The project developed and enhanced the resilience of poor rural communities to climate change by specifically addressing linkages between climate variabilities, food security and human health in agriculture-based livelihood systems. Based on a detailed assessment of trends in climate variabilities and its direct and indirect impacts on livelihood security, the project identified and enhanced community-based capacities and policy frameworks favorable to preventing species extinction.

Design/methodology/approach – Extreme value theory is applied when measuring the systemic risk of financial institutions. Extremal quantile regression, where extreme value distribution is assumed for the tail, is used to measure the extreme risk and analyze the changes in and dependencies of risk. Furthermore, influential factors of systemic risk are analyzed using panel regression. Findings – The key findings of the paper are that value at risk and contribution to systemic risk are very different when measuring the risk of a financial institution; banks’ contributions to systemic risk are much higher; and size and leverage ratio are two significant and important factors influencing an institution's systemic risk. Practical implications – Characterizing variables of financial institutions such as size, leverage ratio and market beta should be considered together when regulating and constraining financial institutions.

The current financial crisis in Europe has arguably casted fresh doubt on the role and need for deposit insurance. In this regard, the deposit insurance system’s rationale is a key starting issue in order to fully understand its design and role within a financial safety net system. Design/methodology/approach – Using the UK regulatory regime as the main reference point, the deposit insurance system’s objectives are divided into two broad categories: depositor protection and financial stability. Findings – It is argued that a deposit insurance system could only be effective if designed to perform key regulatory objectives. Otherwise, authorities will keep resorting to other rescue measures, as this system will never be well equipped to respond to a bank failure. Practical implications – Notwithstanding recent regulatory reforms, there is still a lack of clear objectives and, thus, a clear profile for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, as the UK deposit compensation scheme. In light of systemic risk and increased demands on prudential banking regulation, the UK deposit insurance system should be reformed to perform significant regulatory objectives. Social implications – The further reform of the UK deposit insurance will enhance depositor protection and financial stability, especially amid the euro-crisis. Originality/value – An effective reform of deposit insurance requires a clear role-setting for deposit insurance. To this end, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis of all regulatory objectives that the post-crisis UK deposit insurance system should serve. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bank competition; Bank resolution; Deposit guarantee scheme; Deposit guarantee schemes directive; Deposit insurance; Depositor protection; Financial services compensation scheme; Financial stability; Government guarantee",,"Kleftouri, N.; Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, United Kingdom; email: nikoletta.kleftouri@postgrad.sas.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13581988,,,,"English","J.

Actually, it has been recognized that CDS spread time series did not anticipate but only followed the increasing risk of default before the financial crisis. In principle, the network of correlations among CDS spread time series could at least display some form of structural change to be used as an early warning of systemic risk. Here we study a set of 176 CDS time series of financial institutions from 2002 to 2011. Networks are constructed in various ways, some of which display structural change at the onset of the credit crisis of 2008, but never before. By taking these networks as a proxy of interdependencies among financial institutions, we run stress-test based on Group DebtRank. Systemic risk before 2008 increases only when incorporating a macroeconomic indicator reflecting the potential losses of financial assets associated with house prices in the US.

With regards to elasticities, the findings indicate that the credit is very sensitive to variations in economic activity and, in turn, prudential regulation presents a stronger influence on credit than the basic interest rate and the reserve requirement rate. Moreover, the estimates suggest that aggregate investment is more sensitive to entrepreneurs’ expectations and credit supply.Practical implications – Aiming to reduce systemic risk in the economy, capital requirements may be increased in order to induce banks to a lower risk exposure by reducing the supply of loans. However, while this instrument strengthens the banking system, it can also lead the banking system to become less sensitive to monetary policy shocks, and also discourage aggregate demand through the influence that the credit exerts on investments. As a consequence, prudential regulation is an important tool because it acts on the balance between economic growth and low risk exposure of banks.Originality/value – The paper provides useful insights to academicians, economists and policymakers who are interested in understanding the effects of monetary policies and prudential regulation on aggregate investment through the credit channel in an emerging economy under inflation targeting.

Thisstudy aimed at exploring in vivo the relationship between local endothelial shear stress (ESS) and coronary plaque characteristics in humans using computational fluid dynamics and frequency-domain optical coherence tomography. Methods and Results: Three-dimensional coronary artery reconstruction was performed in 21 patients (24 arteries) presenting with acute coronary syndrome using frequency-domain optical coherence tomography and coronary angiography. Each coronary artery was divided into sequential 3-mm segments and analyzed for the assessment of local ESS and plaque characteristics. A total of 146 nonculprit segments were evaluated. Compared with segments with higher ESS [≥1 Pascal (Pa)], those with low ESS (<1 Pa) showed higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaques (37.5% versus 20.0%; P=0.019) and thin-cap fibroatheroma (12.5% versus 2.0%; P=0.037). Overall, lipid plaques in segments with low ESS had thinner fibrous cap (115 μm [63-166] versus 170 μm [107-219]; P=0.004) and higher macrophage density (normalized standard deviation: 8.4% [4.8-12.6] versus 6.2% [4.2-8.8]; P=0.017). Segments with low ESS showed more superficial calcifications (minimum calcification depth: 93 μm [50-140] versus 152 μm [105-258]; P=0.049) and tended to have higher prevalence of spotty calcifications (26.0% versus 12.0%; P=0.076). Conclusions: Coronary regions exposed to low ESS are associated with larger lipid burden, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma in humans. Frequency-domain optical coherence tomography-based assessment of ESS and wall characteristics may be useful in identifying vulnerable coronary regions.

Agents are endowed with balance sheets comprising the risky asset as well as cash on the asset side and equity capital as well as debt on the liabilities side. A number of findings emerge when simulating the model: we find that the empirically observable log-normal distribution of bank balance sheet size naturally emerges and that higher levels of leverage lead to a greater inequality among agents. Furthermore, greater leverage increases the frequency of bankruptcies and systemic events. Credit frictions, which we define as the stickiness of debt adjustments, are able to explain a key difference in the relation between leverage and assets observed for different bank types. Lowering credit frictions leads to an increasingly procyclical behavior of leverage, which is typical for investment banks. Nevertheless, the impact of credit frictions on the fragility of the model financial system is complex.

This study examined 15-year outcomes among women younger than 40 years treated with breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation therapy (BCT) compared with those treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM).Methods and Materials: Women aged 20 to 39 years with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2003 were identified in a population-based database. Primary outcomes of breast cancerespecific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes of local relapseefree survival (LRFS), locoregional relapseefree survival (LRRFS), and distant relapseefree survival (DRFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between BCT and MRM cohorts using logrank tests. A planned subgroup analysis was performed on patients considered ideal for BCT (ie, T1N0, negative margins and no extensive ductal carcinoma in situ) and in whom local therapy may have the largest impact on survival because of low systemic risk.Results: 965 patients were identified; 616 had BCT and 349 had MRM. The median follow-up time was 14.4 years (range, 8.4-23.3 years). Overall, 15-year rates of BCSS (76.0% vs 74.1%, P=.62), OS (74.2% vs 73.0%, P=.75), LRFS (85.4% vs 86.5%, P=.95), LRRFS (82.2% vs 81.6%, P=.61), and DRFS (74.4% vs 71.6%, P=.40) were similar between the BCT and MRM cohorts. In the ideal for BCT subgroup, there were 219 BCT and 67 MRM patients with a median follow-up time of 15.5 years. The 15-year BCSS (86.1% vs 82.9%, P=.57), OS (82.6% vs 82.9%, P=.89), LRFS (86.2% vs 84.2%, P=.50), LRRFS (83.1% vs 78.3%, P=.24), and DRFS (84.8% vs 79.1%, P=.17) were similar in the BCT and MRM cohorts.Conclusions: This population-based analysis with long-term follow-up confirmed that women younger than 40 years treated with BCT had similar 15-year outcomes compared with MRM.

In this type of setting, the nodes of a graph represent banks/firms and links represent the relationship between lending and borrowing agents. Since both loans and bad debts proceed through credit linkages, we analyze how market connectivity - in particular the interbank one - affects agents' performances, bankruptcy cascades and business cycle fluctuations. Specifically, interbank linkages allow banks to share credit risk but at the same time they can spread one bank's crisis through the whole network.

The problem of 'soft law', along with its pros and cons, is discussed and a parallel is drawn with the European legislation in the field of norms standardization. This article discusses transition economics as a source of systemic risk. Data from the Russian Federation and EU countries are given as examples. The main findings stress the need to adapt international standards to national legislation, and emphasize the need for forecasting, the creation of countercyclical capital buffers, the need to combine the use of macro-prudential approaches with monetary policy, and the necessity to regulate institutional structure. It should also be noted, that all government policy, especially monetary, fiscal, and macro-and micro-prudential (supplemented by specific supervision), should be a part of a permanent system of macro-financial stability, created to predict financial crises. The economic crisis has shown that financial stability cannot be guaranteed by each country independently. This is necessary, but not sufficient.

The evolution of such risk factors is vital for the credit risk analysis of a rural bank. The purpose of this paper is to determine the importance of price volatility and climate factors within a default risk model. Design/methodology/approach – The authors estimate a generalized linear model (GLM) based on a structural default risk model. With the estimated factor loadings, the authors simulate the loss distribution of the portfolio and perform stress test to determine the impact of the relevant risk factors on economic capital. Findings – The results indicate that both the price volatility and climate factors are statistically significant; however, their economic significance is smaller compare to other factors that the authors control for: macroeconomic conditions for the agricultural sector and intermediate input prices. Research limitations/implications – The analysis of non-systemic risk factors such as price volatility and climate conditions requires statistical methods focussed on measuring causal effects at higher quantiles, not just at the conditional mean, this is, however, a current limitation of GLMs. Practical implications – The authors provide a design of a portfolio credit risk model, that is more suited to the special characteristics of a rural bank, than commercial credit risk models.

If spatial autocorrelation and small sample size are not properly accounted for in premium ratings, the premium rates may inaccurately reflect the risk of a loss. Design/methodology/approach – The paper first examines the spatial autocorrelation among county-level yields of corn and soybeans in the Corn Belt by calculating Moran’s I and the effective spatial degrees of freedom. After establishing the existence of spatial autocorrelation, copula models are used to estimate the joint distribution of corn yields and the joint distribution of soybean yields for a group of nine counties in Illinois. Bootstrap samples of the corn and soybean yields are generated to estimate copula models with the purpose of creating sampling distributions. Findings – The estimated bootstrap confidence intervals demonstrate that the copula parameter estimates and the premium rates derived from the parameter estimates can vary greatly. There is also evidence of bias in the parameter estimates. Originality/value – Although small samples will always be an issue in crop insurance ratings and assumptions must be made for the federal crop insurance program to operate at its current scale, this analysis sheds light on some of the issues caused by using small samples and will hopefully lead to the mitigation of these small sample issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bootstrap; Copula; Crop insurance; Spatial autocorrelation; Systemic risk; Yield distribution",,"Hungerford, A.E.; Economic Research ServicesUnited States; email: ashley.e.hungerford@ers.usda.gov",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",00021466,,,,"English","Agric.

But the failure of American International Group in 2008 posed a more complex aspect of financial contagion. This study presents an extension of the asset network systemic risk model (ANWSER) to investigate whether credit default swaps mitigate or intensify the severity of financial contagion. A protection buyer bank transfers the risk of every possible debtor bank default to protection seller banks. The empirical distribution of the number of bank bankruptcies is obtained with the extended model. Systemic capital buffer ratio is calculated from the distribution. The ratio quantifies the effective loss absorbency capability of the entire financial system to force back financial contagion. The key finding is that the leverage ratio is a good estimate of a systemic capital buffer ratio as the backstop of a financial system.

This critical review outlined an innovative solution incorporating composite slab theory and combining with the capabilities of being precast and modular, in order to reduce the depth, weight and required installation time relative to conventional track slab systems. Systemic risks, compatibilities and compliances are highlighted to warrant real-world applicability of composite structures. © 2014 The Institution of Engineers, Singapore.","bridge; construction; maintenance; modular components; precast composites; railway infrastructure; replacement; tracks","Bridges; Construction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Maintenance; Railroads; Reinforced concrete; Timber; Modular components; Pre-cast; Railway infrastructure; replacement; tracks; Railroad transportation","Kaewunruen, S.; School of Civil Engineering, United Kingdom",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",19373260,,,,"English","IES J.

The current study examined whether drug dealing, independent of its connection to drug use, increases involvement with delinquent peers, violence, weapons, and other drug-related conflicts. Data were drawn from the first two waves of the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (N = 1,148). Hierarchical linear models were used to investigate changes in these behaviors that resulted from the respondents' involvement in drug dealing and drug use. Results indicate that involvement in drug dealing, controlling for drug use, increases violence and other systemic risks to a level that drug use alone is not likely to achieve. Findings also show, however, that drug use among dealers may reduce violence and limit contact with delinquent peers. © The Author(s) 2014.","Dealing; Drugs; Violence",,"Seffrin, P.M.; Marywood University, 2300 Adams Avenue, United States; email: seffrin@marywood.edu",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",00220426,,JDGIA,,"English","J.

The merchant bank sector proves to be fragile (has a short distance to default) regardless of competition. In this setting, the policy response, consisting in official guarantees for the merchant bank's liabilities, entails considerable government loss risk. An alternative without the need for public sector involvement is to encourage systemically important merchant banks to introduce a simple bail-in mechanism by restricting their liabilities to contingent convertible bonds.

Banks have reacted to the challenges posed by the new operating environment by creating new products and expanding their activities to some uncharted business areas. In this paper, we study how modern banking which gave birth to the off-balance-sheet leverage activities affected the risk profile of U.S. banks as well as the level of systemic risk before and after the onset of the late 2000s financial crisis. Towards this, we separate on- from off-balance-sheet leverage and capture the latter with different, yet complementary, measures which do not exist in the current literature. Special attention is paid on the deleveraging process that occurred in the banking market after the crisis erupted, which is an additional innovative feature of this study. Our findings reveal that leverage, both explicit and hidden off-the-balance-sheet, increases the individual risk of banking firms making them vulnerable to financial shocks. Reverse leverage, on the other hand, is beneficial for individual banks' health, but is found to be harmful for financial stability. We also demonstrate that the banks which concentrate on traditional lines of business typically carry less risk compared to those involved with modern financial instruments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Bank leverage; Deleveraging process; Financial crisis; Individual bank risk; Systemic risk",,"Papanikolaou, N.I.; Luxembourg School of Finance, University of Luxembourg, 4 rue Albert Borschette, Luxembourg",,"Elsevier",15723089,,,,"English","J.

To this end, we rely on the δ. CoVaR systemic risk measure introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). In order to provide a formal ranking of the financial sectors with respect to their contribution to systemic risk, the original δ. CoVaR approach is extended here to include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test developed by Abadie (2002), based on bootstrapping. Our empirical results reveal that in the Eurozone, for the period ranging from 2004 to 2012, the other financial services sector contributes relatively the most to systemic risk at times of distress affecting this sector. In turn, the banking sector appears to contribute more to systemic risk than the insurance sector. By contrast, the insurance industry is the systemically riskiest financial sector in the United States for the same period, while the banking sector contributes the least to systemic risk in this area. Beyond this ranking, the three financial sectors of interest are found to contribute significantly to systemic risk, both in the Eurozone and in the United States. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","CoVaR; Quantile regression; Stochastic dominance test; Systemic risk",,"Guilmin, G.; Center for Research in Finance and Management (CeReFiM), University of Namur, Rempart de la Vierge, 8, Belgium",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

Since the average duration of crises in this sample of countries is longer than one year, the predictive performance of standard binomial logit models is likely to be hampered by the so-called crisis duration bias. The bias arises from the decision to either treat crisis years after the onset of a crisis as non-crisis years or remove them altogether from the model. To overcome this potential drawback, we propose a multinomial logit approach, which is shown to improve the predictive power of our EWS compared to the binomial logit model. Our results suggest that crisis events in low income countries are associated with low economic growth, drying up of banking system liquidity and widening of foreign exchange net open positions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Banking crises; Early warning systems; Financial regulation; Logit estimation; Low income countries; Sub-Saharan Africa; Systemic risk",,"Leonida, L.; School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London, Mile End Road, United Kingdom",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

The agents may be subjected to an idiosyncratic or common external influence and also some random noise. The system’s stochastic dynamics is studied by numerical simulations. It displays the characteristics of punctuated, multiple equilibria, sensitivity to small details, and path dependence. The dynamics is so slow that one can meaningfully speak of quasi-equilibrium states. Performing measurements of correlations between the agents choices we find that they are random both as to their sign and absolute value, but their distribution is very broad when the interaction dominates both the noise and the external field. This means that random but strong correlations appear with large probability. In the two dimensional model this also implies that the correlations on average fall off with distance very slowly: the system is essentially non-local, small changes at one end may have a strong impact at the other. The strong, random correlations tend to organize a large fraction of the agents into strongly correlated clusters that act together. If we think of this model as a metaphor of social or economic agents or bank networks, the systemic risk implications of this tendency are clear: any impact on even a single strongly correlated agent will not be confined to a small set but will spread, in an unforeseeable manner, to the whole system via the strong random correlations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Economics; Multi-agent models; Social science; Statistical mechanics; Systemic risk",,"Kondor, I.; Parmenides Foundation, Germany",,"Springer Verlag",1860711X,,,,"English","J.

A multi-agent simulation model including heterogenous banks is built to study how interbank network structures and banks' balance sheet structures affect financial contagion. The results indicate that a core-periphery interbank structure would increase the influence of financial contagion compared with a complete network structure. Moreover, the balance sheet structure would affect financial contagion, with a higher equity ratio increasing financial stability and decreasing probability of financial contagion, and a higher interbank asset and debt ratio the opposite.

In this context, the happening of an event (e.g., system failure) in one sector may lead to a serious risk in another. To avoid this, a systemic approach for risk management is required. This approach pursues the objective to foster the accuracy and the reactivity of the risk mitigation and hence minimize the impact and the propagation of the risk and, as a consequence, sustain the initiatives from all economic domains' regulators in risk management.

One of them is the existence of systemic risk that affects all of the policies at the same time. We introduce here a probabilistic approach to examine the consequences of its presence on the risk loading of the premium of a portfolio of insurance policies. This approach could be easily generalized for investment risk. We see that, even with a small probability of occurrence, systemic risk can reduce dramatically the diversification benefits. It is clearly revealed via a non-diversifiable term that appears in the analytical expression of the variance of our models. We propose two ways of introducing it and discuss their advantages and limitations. By using both VaR and TVaR to compute the loading, we see that only the latter captures the full effect of systemic risk when its probability to occur is low. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Diversification; Expected shortfall; Insurance premium; Investment risk; Risk loading; Risk management; Risk measure; Risk portfolio; Stochastic model; Systemic risk; Value-at-risk",,"Kratz, M.; ESSEC Business School Paris, av.

For over a decade now that have been efforts to establish the starting point in explaining this condition or characteristic of the financial system since some find that the key to defining financial stability lies in stability and others argue in favour of the opposite, instability. Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on a universal definition that would be widely accepted at the international level. Consequently, this gave rise to open discussions on systemic risk, creating a framework for preserving financial stability, and the role of central banks in this process. This article analyses the results achieved in the development of a theoretical concept of financial stability and its practical implementation. A consensus has been reached on the necessity of removing rigid barriers between macro and prudential policies and on the necessity of their coordinated actions. The primary objectives of monetary and fiscal stability have been shifted towards preserving financial stability. The isolated macroprudential principle rightfully got the epithet of an archaic approach. Coordinated micro and macroprudential policies have definitely prevailed and become reality in many countries, including Montenegro. Created institutional frameworks for safeguarding financial stability at all levels - national, Pan-European and global - represent a challenge for further comparative studies. © Copyright 2015 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","Central bank; Financial stability; Framework for safeguarding financial stability; Microprudential and macroprudential; Monetary policy; Systemic risk",,"Vlahović, A.; Central Bank of MontenegroMontenegro; email: ana.vlahovic@cbcg.me",,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",18009581,,,,"English","J.

The pre-operative clinical data of 30 patients (from 2010 to 2013, Beijing Tongren Hospital) who underwent Draf III surgery, with the testing results of T&T olfactory testing, acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry before and 1 year after operation in these patients were collected in this study. All patients complete visual analogue scale (VAS), a telephone follow-up questionnaire of olfactory function used by Wormald and Lund-Kenndy endoscopy score simultaneously with testings above. Most of 30 patients were chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with recurrent nasal polyps or systemic risk factors like asthma and aspirin-intolerance, called refractory rhinosinusitis. SPSS 19.0 software was used to analyze the data.RESULTS: 89.3% (25/28) of these patients improved in nasal obstruction 1 year after operation, and the cure rats was 57.1% (16/28, VAS = 0). The level of improvement in nasal obstruction was significantly correlated with pre-operative nasal obstruction severity (r = 0.909, P < 0.01). 76.7% (23/30) improved in olfactory function 1 year after operation in all 30 patients, and 88.2% improved in patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). It was also found that olfactory function 1 year after operation was significantly related to Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores (r = 0.671, P < 0.01), but was not correlated with VAS scores of nasal obstruction (P = 0.349).CONCLUSION: The Draf III frontal sinus surgery has a significantly positive effect on olfactory and ventilation function post-operatively, especially on refractory rhinosinusitis.",,"acoustic rhinometry; animal; asthma; chronic disease; endoscopy; frontal sinus; human; nose obstruction; nose polyp; odor; paranasal sinus; prospective study; rat; retrospective study; rhinomanometry; risk factor; sinusitis; surgery; treatment outcome; Animals; Asthma; Chronic Disease; Endoscopy; Frontal Sinus; Humans; Nasal Obstruction; Nasal Polyps; Paranasal Sinuses; Prospective Studies; Rats; Retrospective Studies; Rhinomanometry; Rhinometry, Acoustic; Risk Factors; Sinusitis; Smell; Treatment Outcome",,,,16730860,,,"25487578","Chinese","Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930893428

It is therefore not surprising that the Dodd-Frank Act-the United States' primary legislative response to the crisis-contained an entire title dedicated to insurance regulation, which has traditionally been the responsibility of individual states. The most important insurance-focused reforms in Dodd-Frank empower the Federal Reserve Bank to impose an additional layer of regulatory scrutiny on top of state insurance regulation for a small number of ""systemically important"" nonbank financial companies, such as AIG. This Article argues, however, that in focusing on the risk that an individual insurance-focused, nonbank financial company could become systemically significant, Dodd-Frank largely overlooked a second, and equally important, potential source of systemic risk in insurance: the prospect that correlations among individual insurance companies could contribute to or cause widespread financial instability. In fact, this Article argues that there are often substantial correlations among individual insurance companies with respect to both their interconnections with the larger financial system and their vulnerabilities to failure. As a result, the insurance industry as a whole can pose systemic risks that regulation should attempt to identify and manage. Traditional state-based insurance regulation, this Article contends, is poorly adapted to accomplishing this given the mismatch between state boundaries and systemic risks, as well as states' limited oversight of noninsurance financial markets. As such, this Article suggests enhancing the power of the Federal Insurance Office -A federal entity primarily charged with monitoring the insurance industry - To supplement or preempt state law when states have failed to satisfactorily address gaps or deficiencies in insurance regulation that could contribute to systemic risk.",,,,,"University of Chicago Law School",00419494,,,,"English","Univ.

All subjects underwent conventional oral examinations to identify mucosal lesions according to the EC-Clearinghouse/World Health Organization classifications.Results: The findings revealed that 68% of the HIV group exhibited HIV-related lesions compared with 4% in the control group. The most commonly observed oral or peri-oral HIV manifestations, which were statistically different between the groups were in descending order, mucosal hyperpigmentation: 28 (56%), candidiasis: 7 (14%), dry lips/dry mucosa: 6 (12%), and unilateral or bilateral swelling of major salivary glands: 5 (10%). Other non HIV-related oral lesions that were reported more in the HIV group than the control group was coated tongue and leukoedema (p<0.05).

It is anticipated that in the near-term future, CCPs across the world will be linked through interoperability agreements that facilitate risk-sharing but also serve as a conduit for transmitting shocks. This paper theoretically studies a network with CCPs that are linked through interoperability arrangements, and studies the properties of the network that contribute to cascading failures. The magnitude of the cascading is theoretically related to the strength of network linkages, the size of the network, the logistic mapping coefficient, a stochastic effect and CCP's defense lines. Simulations indicate that larger network effects increase systemic risk from cascading failures. The size of the network N raises the threshold value of shock sizes that are required to generate cascades. Hence, the larger the network, the more robust it will be. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","cascading failures; CCP interoperability; network effects; robustness; Systemic risk",,,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

In this paper, we study the efficiency of different burden-sharing agreements for the recapitalisation of the 30 largest banks in Europe. We consider bank bailouts for these banks in a simulation framework with stochastic country-specific bailout benefits. Among the burden sharing rules, we find that the majority and qualified-majority voting rules come close to the efficiency of a bailout mechanism with a supranational authority. Even a unanimous voting rule works better than home-country bailouts, which are very inefficient.

We follow an academic paper by Kritzman, Li, Page and Rigobon (2011) who proposed this metric. The measure is intended to signal when the market is becoming highly fragile because risk is beginning to concentrate in a narrow direction. We extend these ideas to measure the systemic risk of an individual portfolio.The absorption ratio is essentially the fraction of a set of assets’ total variance ‘absorbed’ by a fixed number of risk factors. A high absorption ratio suggests the risk in the market is beginning to concentrate, making it vulnerable to a narrow negative shock. Our empirical analysis assesses an equity market environment and a typical local portfolio. The evidence in both cases shows there was an increase in the absorption ratio prior to significant losses in the market. Interestingly, the results also show that, subsequent to the 2008 crash, the absorption ratio remained at relatively high levels, indicating that the market remained fragile and vulnerable to any further narrow shocks – but that perhaps bail-outs averted any further shocks.Our results using both data sets thus confirm the usefulness of the absorption ratio as a signalling metric of rising systemic risk in the South African environment. © 2014 Universiteit Stellenbosch.

London: Everyman's Library) and Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent (2004. Oxford: Oxford University Press) participate in the emergence of systemic risk around the turn of the twentieth century, in terms of their extended dramatizations of revolutionary violence and anarchism. In each novel, risk becomes manifest as a movement between the macro-political and the micro-political: revolutionary anarchist plots and the police actions taken to uncover and neutralize them often become indistinguishable from the novels love plots and domestic dramas. This movement allows James and Conrad to diagnose the political affects of late Victorian liberal ideology in often surprising ways, including how these ideologies pre-conditioned a negative response to anarchism - as terroristic, as a foreign contagion, if not as a form of evil - and sought to confine anarchism within its disciplinary apparatuses. At the same time, as James and Conrad multiply, bewilder - if not dissolve - narrative plot, they allow us to rethink plot itself at a formal or meta-fictional level. Thus, we might ask, as determinism corroded and as Darwinist, thermodynamic, and statistical modes of thinking embraced chance and probability, how narrative plot also became contingent, probabilistic, and given to uncertainty and risk; or, further, how narrative fiction can serve as a barometer of late-nineteenth-century risk society, if not itself a form of resilience in the face of that society. © 2014 The English Academy of Southern Africa.","Anarchism; Henry James; Joseph Conrad; Plot; Risk; The nineteenth-century novel",,"Jonik, M.; School of English, United Kingdom",,"Routledge",10131752,,,,"English","Engl.

The author analyzes the Basel framework and its role as a major source of systemic risk. Furthermore, the Basel framework is unlikely to enhance the safety of the financial system and prevent future crises. As such, Basel should be scrapped and regulators should revert to a simple tangible common equity (TCE) leverage rule. Design/methodology/approach – The paper aims to review the extensive existing literature and analytic approach to the problem, trying to answer the question: why Basel? The paper looks at the Basel methodology of calculating risk-weighed assets. Findings – The paper looks at the basic reasons underlying the Basel failure: complexity, variations in measurement of risk-weighed assets across banking institutions, ability to game the system and amplification of systemic risk. The research concludes that a simple TCE leverage rule is superior to Basel in controlling systemic risk. Research limitations/implications – Further research will be needed in determining the “optimal” level of capital. Practical implications – Regulators and bankers should seek simplicity in capital rules. The dubious use of quantitative models can only lead to spurious precision.

Furthermore, financial instability can damage the broader economy. Financial regulation is intended to protect borrowers and investors that participate in financial markets and mitigate financial instability. This report provides an overview of the regulatory policies of the agencies that oversee banking and securities markets and explains which agencies are responsible for which institutions, activities, and markets. Some agencies regulate particular types of institutions for risky behavior or conflicts of interest, some agencies promulgate rules for certain financial transactions no matter what kind of institution engages in them, and other agencies enforce existing rules for some institutions, but not for others. These regulatory activities are not necessarily mutually exclusive. These regulatory activities are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Banking U.S. banking regulation traditionally focuses on prudence. Banks' business decisions are regulated for safety and soundness and adequate capital. In addition, banks are given access to a lender of last resort, and some bank creditors are provided guarantees (deposit insurance). Regulating the risks that banks take is believed to help smooth the credit cycle. The credit cycle refers to periodic booms and busts in lending. Prudential safety and soundness regulation and capital requirements date back to the 1860s when bank credit formed the money supply. The Federal Reserve (Fed) as lender of last resort was created following the Panic of 1907. Deposit insurance was established in the 1930s to reduce the incentive of depositors to withdraw funds from banks during a financial panic. Securities, Derivatives, and Similar Contract Markets Federal securities regulation has traditionally focused on disclosure and conflicts of interest, rather than on prudence. Securities regulation is typically designed to ensure that market participants have access to enough information to make informed decisions, rather than to limit the riskiness of the business models of publicly traded firms. Firms that sell securities to the public must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC registration in no way implies that an investment is safe, only that material risks have been disclosed. The SEC also registers several classes of securities market participants and firms. It has enforcement powers for certain types of industry misstatements or omissions and for certain types of conflicts of interest. Derivatives trading is supervised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees trading on the futures exchanges, which have self-regulatory responsibilities as well. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203) required more disclosures in the over-the-counter (off-exchange) derivatives market than prior to the financial crisis and has granted the CFTC and SEC authority over large derivatives traders. Government Sponsored Enterprises The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) oversees a group of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Two of the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, securitize residential mortgages, and they were placed in conservatorship following mortgage losses in 2008. In the conservatorship, the Treasury provides financial support to the GSEs and FHFA and Treasury have managerial control over the enterprises. FHFA also regulates the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system, a GSE composed of 12 regional banks owned by the 8,000 financial institutions that they serve. Changes Following the 2008 Financial Crisis The Dodd-Frank Act created the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and authorized a permanent staff to monitor systemic risk and consolidated bank regulation from five agencies to four. The DFA granted the Federal Reserve oversight authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) resolution authority over the largest financial firms. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated consumer protection rulemaking, which had been dispersed among several federal agencies, in the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Special Topics The appendices in this report include additional information on topics, such as the regulatory structure prior to the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), organizational differences among financial firms, and the rating system that regulators use to evaluate the health of banks.

This wisdom thus argues that through contracts risk is shifted to those better able to handle these uncertainties while dispersing the risk across more participants. The recent global financial crisis, however, brings these claims and assumptions into doubt. Indeed these financial instruments may add to and concentrate the amount risk that must be managed and regulated rather than transferring it to more and stronger hands. Indeed recent experience with situations such as the near collapse of AIG and the bankruptcy of Lehman has caused regulators to instigate new regulations such as the Volker Rule to limit contractual risk exposure. Further some financial firms have exploited their greater sophistication to shift contractual risk to those with little understanding of the actual risks involved as in Detroit's recent bankruptcy filing. Therefore in explaining how contractual risk occurs this chapter also indicates why the laws and regulations requiring more capital, separate trading entities and the use of exchanges may not be enough to limit global contractual exposures and the related financial systemic risk. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Events from the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the Greek sovereign debt crisis demonstrate the urgent and abiding need for statistical tools adequate to measure and anticipate the amplitude of potential swings in the financial markets-from ordinary stock price and interest rate moves, to defaults, to those increasingly frequent ""rare events"" fashionably called black swan events. Yet many on Wall Street continue to rely on standard models based on artificially simplified assumptions that can lead to systematic (and sometimes catastrophic) underestimation of real risks. In Practical Methods of Financial Engineering and Risk Management, Dr. Rupak Chatterjee- former director of the multi-asset quantitative research group at Citi-introduces finance professionals and advanced students to the latest concepts, tools, valuation techniques, and analytic measures being deployed by the more discerning and responsive Wall Street practitioners, on all operational scales from day trading to institutional strategy, to model and analyze more faithfully the real behavior and risk exposure of financial markets in the cold light of the post-2008 realities. Until one masters this modern skill set, one cannot allocate risk capital properly, price and hedge derivative securities realistically, or risk-manage positions from the multiple perspectives of market risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, and systemic risk. The book assumes a working knowledge of calculus, statistics, and Excel, but it teaches techniques from statistical analysis, probability, and stochastic processes sufficient to enable the reader to calibrate probability distributions and create the simulations that are used on Wall Street to valuate various financial instruments correctly, model the risk dimensions of trading strategies, and perform the numerically intensive analysis of risk measures required by various regulatory agencies. What you'll learn Practical Methods lays out the core financial engineering and risk management concepts and techniques that real-world practitioners use on a daily basis, including: Bloomberg analysis of financial instruments Statistical analysis of financial data Simulation of stochastic processes Statistical modeling of trading strategies Optimal hedging Monte Carlo (OHMC) methods Credit derivatives valuation Counterparty credit risk (CCR) and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) Basel II and III risk measures Power laws and extreme value theory (EVT) Hedge fund replication Who this book is for Practical Methods of Financial Engineering and Risk Management is for Wall Street professionals and advanced students training to be risk managers, quantitative analysts, portfolio managers, and traders.

We employ various network investigation tools such as volume, transactions, links, connectivity and reciprocity to gain a clearer picture of the network topology of the interbank market. We study the main borrower role of Demirbank in the crash of the banking system with network centrality measures which are extensively used in the network theory.

However, empirical evidence suggests that those rules are difficult both for regulators to enforce and for financial institutions to implement. We present a data-driven analytical model that automatically and algorithmically creates groups of related parties and calculates the associated exposure based on ownership information, financial dependencies, business associations, and family ties. The methodology highlights missing critical information, identifies unreported business partners, and finds the business groups that maximize the relevant exposure. The approach can be used prospectively by regulators and by banking institutions analyzing credit risk. We include a case study, applying the methodology retrospectively to highlight large exposure violations and systemic risk leading up to the banking crash in 2008.","Client groups; Large exposures; Related clients; Related parties","Data Science; Risk assessment; Banking institutions; Business associations; Client groups; Exposure estimation; Financial institution; Large exposures; Related clients; Related parties; Banking",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",07308078,9781450330121,,,"English","Proc.

We document strong evidence that, since the early 1980s, consumption has been increasingly funded by smaller savings, booming financial profits, wealth extracted from house price appreciation and explosive debt. This is in stark contrast with the productivity-fueled growth that was seen in the 1950s and 1960s. We describe the transition, in gestation in the 1970s, towards the regime of the “illusion of the perpetual money machine”, which started at full speed in the early 1980s and developed until 2008. This regime was further supported by a climate of deregulation and a massive growth in financial derivatives designed to spread and diversify the risks globally. The result has been a succession of bubbles and crashes, including the worldwide stock market bubble and great crash of October 1987, the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s, the burst in 1991 of the enormous Japanese real estate and stock market bubbles, the emerging markets bubbles and crashes in 1994 and 1997, the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis of 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting in 2000, the recent house price bubbles, the financialization bubble via special investment vehicles, the stock market bubble, the commodity and oil bubbles and the current debt bubble, all developing jointly and feeding on each other until 2008. This situation may be further aggravated in the next decade by an increase in financialization, through exchange-traded-funds (ETFs), speed and automation, through algorithmic trading and public debt, and through growing unfunded liabilities. We conclude that, to get out of this catch 22 situation, we should better manage and understand the incentive structures in our society, we need to focus our efforts on our real economy and we have to respect and master the art of planning and prediction. Only gradual change, with a clear long term planning, can steer our financial and economic system from the turbulence associated with the perpetual money machine to calmer and more sustainable waters. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Economic growth; Financial bubbles; Financial crises; Financialization; Monetary policy; Productivity; Systemic risks",,"Sornette, D.; Department of Management, Scheuchzerstrasse 7, Switzerland; email: dsornette@ethz.ch",,"MDPI",22279091,,,,"English","Risks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905818485

We use a dynamical network approach to evaluate the collective financial failure- systemic risk - quantified by the fraction of active nodes. The systemic risk can be calculated over any future time period, divided into sub-periods, where within each sub-period banks may contiguously fail due to links to either i) assets or ii) other banks, controlled by two parameters, probability of internal failure p and threshold Th (""solvency"" parameter). The systemic risk decreases with the average network degree faster when all assets are equally distributed across banks than if assets are randomly distributed. The more inactive banks each bank can sustain (smaller Th), the smaller the systemic risk- for some Th values in I we report a discontinuity in systemic risk.

Our study aims to reveal the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chinese stock market, and offer an exact interpretation for the evolution behavior. The correlation matrices constructed from the return series of 367 A-share stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2011 are calculated over a moving window with a size of 400 days. The evolutions of the statistical properties of the correlation coefficients, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the correlation matrices are carefully analyzed. We find that the stock correlations are significantly increased in the periods of two market crashes in 2001 and 2008, during which only five eigenvalues significantly deviate from the random correlation matrix, and the systemic risk is higher in these volatile periods than calm periods. By investigating the significant contributors of the deviating eigenvectors in different time periods, we observe a dynamic evolution behavior in business sectors such as IT, electronics, and real estate, which lead the rise (drop) before (after) the crashes. Our results provide new perspectives for the understanding of the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chines stock markets, and the result of risk estimation is valuable for the application of risk management. © 2014 Ren, Zhou.",,"article; Chinese stock market; commercial phenomena; correlational study; electronics; information technology; marketing; mathematical computing; real estate; risk management; algorithm; commercial phenomena; economics; human; investment; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; time; trends; Algorithms; Commerce; Humans; Investments; Marketing; Models, Economic; Risk Management; Time Factors",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"24867071","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901458120

DME, which is characterized by cystic retinal thickening or lipid deposition, is prone to relapse after successful treatment. DME is a complex pathological process caused by multiple factors, including breakdown of the inner and outer blood-retinal barriers, oxidative stress, and elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor which have been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. Starling's law theory explains many of the features of DME. Early detection and treatment of DME can prevent vision loss. Current effective interventions for DME include treatment of systemic risk factors, such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ophthalmic treatments include laser photocoagulation, surgery and intraocular pharmacotherapy. New drugs, which are given by intraocular injection, have emerged in recent years to become first line treatment for DME that affects the central macula with loss of vision. Laser photocoagulation is still the gold standard of treatment for DME which does not involve the central macular. This review outlines these new treatments with particular emphasis on the optimal timing of how they are given. © 2014 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Apoptosis; Diabetic retinopathy; Microvasculopathy; Neuronal degenerative diseases; Therapeutic strategy",,"Zhang, X.; Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University; Beijing Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Key Lab, Beijing 100730, China; email: zhangxy1@trhos.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd",20453701,,,,"English","Cell Biosci.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902078367

The first is the unregulated case, which only imposes limits on maximum leverage. The second is Basle II and the third is a hypothetical alternative in which banks perfectly hedge all of their leverage-induced risk with options. When compared to the unregulated case both Basle II and the perfect hedge policy reduce the risk of default when leverage is low but increase it when leverage is high. This is because both regulation policies increase the amount of synchronized buying and selling needed to achieve deleveraging, which can destabilize the market. None of these policies are optimal for everyone: risk neutral investors prefer the unregulated case with low maximum leverage, banks prefer the perfect hedge policy, and fund managers prefer the unregulated case with high maximum leverage.

The text proposes a framework according to which finance can best be understood as a complex technical system tightly coupled to other social, economic systems. To be more precise, the paper attempts to show how finance is not just any complex system but it can be understood as an ecology of evolving socio-technical systems, sub-systems such as investment banks, hedge funds, high-frequency trading traders, retail investors, pensions funds, etc. All of these are the technical building blocks of our financial markets. Moreover, we attempt to show how concepts from other disciplines, such as entropy, information and noise, can be useful in opening up the world of finance from its traditional economic milieu. Although the following text is confined to the discursive realm of humanities/social sciences, it echoes the analytical approaches of econophysics and experimental economics and particularly the ongoing research around ‘computational evolutionary economics’ [Mirowski, P. 2007. “Markets Come to Bits: Evolution, Computation and Markomata in Economic Science.” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 63: 209–242; Mirowski, P. 2010. “Inherent Vice: Minsky, Markomata, and the Tendency of Markets to Undermine Themselves.” Journal of Institutional Economics 6: 415–443]. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of the so-called robot phase transition from human-dominated trading to the more automatic electronic trading. The current microstructure of automatic market-making can be understood as an ‘ecological niche’ developed by ultra-fast trading algorithms which ‘feed’ on the asymmetries and disparities of the wider ‘financial ecology’. They do this by dissipating noise and adding to the complexity of market microstructure a behaviour that can push the whole ecology to critical thresholds, sometimes referred to as flash crashes. This whole process can ultimately be described by Philip Mirowski's notion of ‘inherent vice’, as well as by Sir Robert May's concept of instability ‘which develops in ecosystems upon increasing bio-diversity’ [Caccioli, F., M. Marsili, and P. Vivo. 2007. “Eroding Market Stability by Proliferation of Financial Instruments.” The European Physical Journal B–Condensed Matter and Complex Systems 71: 467–479; Haldane, A., and R.

Specific data on drug users in correctional centres is not available for the majority of countries, including South Africa. The study aimed to identify the attitudes and knowledge of key informant (KI) offender and correctional centre staff regarding drug use, health and systemic-related problems so as to facilitate the long-term planning of activities in the field of drug-use prevention and systems strengthening in correctional centres, including suggestions for the development of appropriate intervention and rehabilitation programmes.Method: A Rapid Assessment Response (RAR) methodology was adopted which included observation, mapping of service providers (SP), KI interviews (staff and offenders) and focus groups (FGs). The study was implemented in Emthonjeni Youth Correctional Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Fifteen KI staff participants were interviewed and 45 KI offenders. Results: Drug use is fairly prevalent in the centre, with tobacco most commonly smoked, followed by cannabis and heroin. The banning of tobacco has also led to black-market features such as transactional sex, violence, gangsterism and smuggling in order to obtain mainly prohibited tobacco products, as well as illicit substances.Conclusion: HIV, health and systemic-related risk reduction within the Correctional Service sector needs to focus on measures such as improvement of staff capacity and security measures, deregulation of tobacco products and the development and implementation of comprehensive health promotion programmes. © 2014 dos Santos et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Correctional services; Drug use; Harm reduction; Health promotion; Infectious diseases; South Africa","alcohol; benzodiazepine derivative; cannabis; cocaine; diamorphine; illicit drug; mandrax; street drug; adult; article; attitude; clinical article; clinical assessment; drug use; female; health care need; health hazard; heroin dependence; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; information processing; knowledge; male; observation; offender; planning; prison; rapid assessment response; semi structured interview; smoking; smoking ban; social care; South Africa; staff; systemic disease; tobacco; transactional sex; violence; addiction; adolescent; attitude to health; condom; health care manpower; health care personnel; high risk behavior; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; middle aged; needs assessment; prison; prisoner; psychological aspect; South Africa; statistics; tuberculosis; unsafe sex; utilization review; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Condoms; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Manpower; Health Personnel; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Prisoners; Prisons; Risk-Taking; South Africa; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders; Tuberculosis; Unsafe Sex; Young Adult","Dos Santos, M.M.L.; Psychology Department, University of South Africa, UNISA, P.O.

Indeed, it now represents the most prominent farm policy instrument, accounting for more government spending than any other farm commodity program. The 2014 Farm Bill further expanded the crop insurance program and introduced a number of new county-level revenue insurance plans. In 2013, over $123 billion in crop value was insured under the program. Crop revenue insurance, first introduced in the 1990s, now accounts for nearly 70% of the total liability in the program. The available plans cover losses that result from a revenue shortfall that can be triggered by multiple, dependent sources of risk - either low prices, low yields, or a combination of both. The actuarial practices currently applied when rating these plans essentially involve the application of a Gaussian copula model to the pricing of dependent risks. We evaluate the suitability of this assumption by considering a number of alternative copula models. In particular, we use combinations of pair-wise copulas of conditional distributions to model multiple sources of risk. We find that this approach is generally preferred by model-fitting criteria in the applications considered here. We demonstrate that alternative approaches to modeling dependencies in a portfolio of risks may have significant implications for premium rates in crop insurance. © The Author 2014.

The author comes to the conclusion that the economic crisis is not the result of 'too much competition', but of regulatory failure and that the main answers to the economic crisis have to come from 'intelligent regulation'. The relaxation of competition policy would be the wrong policy response in times of economic crisis since competition policy can play an important role in bringing the crisis economy back on track. In contrast to banking the author sees no economic rationale for rescue packages for other economic sectors by referring to systemic risk. The renaissance of industrial policy is viewed with considerable skepticism since empirical evidence shows that the effort of picking 'winners' all too often results in saving 'losers'. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The council is charged with monitoring systemic risk in the financial system and coordinating several federal financial regulators. The 113th Congress may wish to monitor the performance, rulemaking, and policy recommendations of the council. This report describes the mission, membership, and scope of the FSOC. It provides an analysis of several major policy issues related to the FSOC that may come before the 113th Congress. The DFA establishes a regulatory framework of which the FSOC is a consultative council. The new regulatory regime incorporates several policy tools to address systemic risk. The FSOC facilitates communication among financial regulators, collects and evaluates financial data to monitor systemic risk, and designates which financial institutions and financial market utilities will be subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed). Upon a determination of a threat to financial stability, a covered non-bank financial institution in danger of failing may under certain conditions be resolved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), rather than through the bankruptcy process. The FSOC may under certain circumstances set aside some financial regulations for consumers if the rules create systemic risk. The Office of Financial Research (OFR), a permanent staff of financial experts, supports the members of the FSOC. The OFR processes, monitors, and analyzes financial data gathered from member agencies and collected from reporting firms. The OFR contributes to the annual report issued by the FSOC. In the 2013 annual report, the OFR noted a number of positive trends, including increased capital levels and liquidity among financial intermediaries. However, the 2013 report includes several areas of continuing concern. For example, several sources of wholesale funding (such as money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements) remain vulnerable to the risk of runs or fire sales. The housing finance system still relies on government support, although financial trends for the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have improved. A number of operational issues, such as information technology and resilience against cyber-attacks, are ongoing concerns. Interest rates create additional concerns, including the reliability of benchmarks such as LIBOR, and the exposure of financial intermediaries to significant losses should market interest rates rise (sometimes referred to as yield spikes). Longterm budget issues, so-called fiscal imbalances, remain a concern although revenues have recently been rising as general economic conditions improve in the United States. Finally, the 2013 annual report discusses several factors in other countries that could negatively affect financial stability in the United States if conditions overseas deteriorate, including the resolution of European financial turmoil and Japanese macroeconomic policies.

In this work, we study efficient immunization strategies to prevent a default contagion that might occur in a financial network. An essential difference from the previous studies on immunization strategy is that we take into account the possibility of serious side effects. Uniform immunization refers to a situation in which banks are ""vaccinated"" with a common low-risk asset. The riskiness of immunized banks will decrease significantly, but the level of systemic risk may increase due to the de-diversification effect. To overcome this side effect, we propose another immunization strategy, called counteractive immunization, which prevents pairs of banks from failing simultaneously. We find that counteractive immunization can efficiently reduce systemic risk without altering the riskiness of individual banks. © 2014, Nature Publishing Group.

Second, we find that systemic risk contributions are closely related to certain bank characteristic variables (e.g., VaR (value at risk), size and leverage ratio). However, there are differences between the cross-sectional and the time series dimensions in the effects of these variables.

However, pathogenesis of the condition remains unclear. On the other hand, there are also a few studies suggesting that the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) may compromise optic nerve head perfusion and cause glaucomatous optic neuropathy by creating transient hypoxemia and increasing vascular resistance. In this study, we evaluated the possible association between OSAS and NTG. Methods. We recruited 24 patients with NTG and 24 age and sex matched controls who were also similar for systemic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT) and hypercholesterolemia. All patients and controls underwent over-night polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of OSAS and calculation of Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). Results: Patients and controls were statistically similar in terms of age, sex, gender, smoking, systemic risk factors, neck circumference and body mass index. The subjects with AHI ≥ 20 were accepted as OSAS. Ten (41.7%) of 24 patients with NTG and 3 (12.5%) of 24 controls had OSAS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of OSAS was higher in patients with NTG and the difference between patient and control groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). © 2014 Bilgin; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Normal-tension glaucoma; Obstructive sleep apnea","aged; article; case control study; female; human; low tension glaucoma; male; middle aged; polysomnography; prevalence; prospective study; risk factor; sleep disordered breathing; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Low Tension Glaucoma; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive","Bilgin, G.; Ophthalmologist, Hacettepe University, Gün Hospital, Beytepe, 06800 Ankara, Turkey; email: gorkemgencebilgin@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712415,,,"24612638","English","BMC Ophthalmol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898474078

Nevertheless, in credit insurance, the impact of the systemic risk is even more important and can lead to major losses during a crisis. Because of this, the insurer surveils and manages policies almost continuously. The management actions it takes limit the consequences of a downturning cycle. However, the traditional modeling of economic capital does not take into account this important feature of credit insurance. This paper proposes a model aiming to estimate future losses of a credit insurance portfolio, while taking into account the insurer’s management actions. The model considers the capacity of the credit insurer to take on less risk in the case of a cycle downturn, but also the inverse, in the case of a cycle upturn; so, losses are predicted with a more dynamic perspective. According to our results, the economic capital is over-estimated when not considering the management actions of the insurer. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Credit insurance; Cycles; Economic capital; Multi-factor Merton model; Rating transition matrix; Regime-switching Markov chain",,"Caja, A.; Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, France; email: anisa.caja@yahoo.fr",,"MDPI",22279091,,,,"English","Risks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117875416

Financial institutions are prone to insolvency risk channeled through the network of interbank debt and to funding liquidity risk. The government seeks to maximize, under budget constraints, the total net worth of the financial system or, equivalently, to minimize the dead-weight losses induced by bank runs. The government is assumed to have complete information on interbank debt. The problem of quantifying the optimal amount of infusions can be expressed as a convex combinatorial optimization problem, tractable when the set of banks eligible for intervention (core banks) is sufficiently, yet realistically, small.We find that no bank has an incentive to withdrawfromthe program,when the preferred dividend rate paid to the government is equal to the government's outside return on the intervention budget. On the other hand, it may be optimal for the government to make infusions in a strict subset of core banks.

The impact of introducing a central counterparty (CCP) on expected interdealer exposure is determined by the tradeoff between multilateral netting across dealers on one hand and bilateral netting across asset classes on the other hand. We find this tradeoff to be sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in terms of 'riskyness' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures across asset classes. In particular, while an analysis assuming independent, homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one has an unrealistically high number of participants, the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are realistically taken into account.We argue that empirically plausible specifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing does reduce interdealer exposures: the gain frommultilateral netting in a CCP overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements.When a CCP exists for interest rate derivatives, adding a CCP for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures. These findings are shown to be robust to the statistical assumptions of the model as well as the choice of risk measure used to quantify exposures.

It compares two alternative notions of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) available in the current literature. These notions are both based on the conditional distribution of a random variable Y given a stress event for a random variableX, but they use different types of stress events.We derive representations of these alternative CoVaR notions in terms of copulas, study their general dependence consistency and compare their performance in several stochastic models. Our central finding is that conditioning on X ≥ VaRα(X) gives a much better response to dependence between X and Y than conditioning on X = VaRα(X). We prove general results that relate the dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning on X ≥ VaRα(X) to well established results on concordance ordering of multivariate distributions or their copulas. These results also apply to some other systemic risk measures, such as the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and the Systemic Impact Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR based on the stress event X = VaRα(X) is not dependence consistent. In particular, if(X, Y) is bivariate normal, then CoVaR based on X = VaRα(X) is not an increasing function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues arise in the bivariate X model and in the model with X margins and a Gumbel copula. In all these cases, CoVaR based on X ≥ VaRα(X) is an increasing function of the dependence parameter.

The two proposed multivariate CTEs are vector-valued measures with the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. As for the multivariate Value-at-Risk measures introduced by Cousin and Di Bernardino (2013), the lower-orthant CTE (resp. the upper-orthant CTE) is constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions (resp. of multivariate survival distribution functions). Contrary to allocation measures or systemic risk measures, these measures are also suitable for multivariate risk problems where risks are heterogeneous in nature and cannot be aggregated together. Several properties have been derived. In particular, we show that the proposed multivariate CTE-s satisfy natural extensions of the positive homogeneity property, the translation invariance property and the comonotonic additivity property. Comparison between univariate risk measures and components of multivariate CTE is provided. We also analyze how these measures are impacted by a change in marginal distributions, by a change in dependence structure and by a change in risk level.

After applying a three-stage screening process, 17 articles were included in the qualitative analysis, but only 13 in the quantitative analysis, since smoking was a common exposure. The meta-analysis of these 13 studies (478 smokers and 1207 non-smokers) revealed a high level of heterogeneity and that smoking increases the annual rate of bone loss by 0.164 mm/year. Exposure to smoking had a harmful effect on peri-implant bone loss. However, the level of evidence for oral implant therapy in patients with systemic conditions is very low.

Our results confirm that banks tend to behave more homogeneously vis-à-vis macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, we find that both the cross-sectional dispersion of loans-to-assets and the cross-sectional dispersion of non-interest income share shrink during slow growth episodes, and particularly during financial crises, when the resilience of the banking system is at its lowest. More importantly, our main findings indicate that the cross-sectional dispersion of loans-to-assets has increased in the last decade, whereas the cross-sectional dispersion of non-interest income share appears to be more volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic shocks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","EGARCH; Financial stability; Macroeconomic shocks; Macroprudential policy; Non-interest income",,"Calmès, C.; Chaire d'information financière et organisationnelle (UQAM), 101 St. Jean Bosco, Gatineau, QC J8X 3X7, Canada; email: christian.calmes@uqo.ca",,,03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

It shows that loan screening activity is maximized when the loan originating bank retains the equity tranche. However, in case capital structure irrelevance does not hold a profit maximizing bank is likely to favor retention of the less risky mezzanine tranche.

In this paper, we estimate the systemic risk contribution of Italian-listed banks for the period 2000-2011. We follow a methodology first proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier and measure banks' contribution to systemic risk by ΔCoVaR, which measures the contribution of bank i to the financial system VaR when bank i is in a state of distress. We define 'the system' as the set of Italian-listed banks in the sample. First, we find that the information contained in ΔCoVaR is different from that contained in the VaR. Therefore, regulators should take it into account in order to monitor the systemic risk posed by banks. Second, recent policy debate has focused on the danger posed by large banks and on the need to curb their size. We find that size is indeed the main predictor of a bank contribution to systemic risk. However, in the post-Lehman period, leverage is also an important predictor of systemic risk. Consequently, any financial regulation designed only to curb banks' size could not completely eliminate systemic risk because it is exactly in crisis times that leverage becomes relevant. Hence, we conclude that ΔCoVaR is a very useful policy tool for regulators that can estimate which factors are more relevant in terms of contribution to systemic risk. © 2014 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.",,"banking; financial policy; financial system; monitoring system; regulatory framework; risk assessment; variance analysis; Italy","Borri, N.; Department of Economics and Finance, Viale Romania 32, 00197 Rome, Italy; email: nborri@luiss.it",,,03915026,,,,"English","Econ.

We investigate the phenomenon of abrupt breakdown of an electric power-system under two scenarios: load growth (mimicking the ever-increasing customer demand) and power fluctuations (mimicking the effects of renewable sources). Our results on real, realistic and synthetic networks indicate that increasing the system size causes breakdowns to become more abrupt; in fact, mapping the system to a solvable statistical-physics model indicates the occurrence of a first order transition in the large size limit.

The geometric analysis of the time series of cross-country liabilities shows that the systematic information of the interbank international market is contained in a space of small dimension. Geometric spaces of financial relations across countries are developed, for which the space volume, multivariate skewness and multivariate kurtosis are computed. The behavior of these coefficients reveals an important modification acting in the financial linkages since 1997 and allows us to relate the shape of the geometric space that emerges in recent years to the globally turbulent period that has characterized financial systems since the late 1990s. Here we show that, besides a persistent decrease in the volume of the geometric space since 1997, the observation of a generalized increase in the values of the multivariate skewness and kurtosis sheds some light on the behavior of cross-border interdependencies during periods of financial crises. This was found to occur in such a systematic fashion, that these coefficients may be used as a proxy for systemic risk. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We identify richer economic information in the largest eigenvalues deviating from RMT predictions for the housing market than for stock markets and find that the component signs of the eigenvectors contain either geographical information or the extent of differences in house price growth rates or both. By looking at the evolution of different quantities such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we find that the US housing market experienced six different regimes, which is consistent with the evolution of state clusters identified by the box clustering algorithm and the consensus clustering algorithm on the partial correlation matrices.

Our analytical derivation of this probability uses the theory of Laplace asymptotics, which is related to the large deviations theory of rare events. The theory of Laplace asymptotics is an area of applied probability that studies the exponential decay rate of certain probabilities and is often used in the analysis of the tails of probability distributions. We show that the maximum-exposure probability depends on the topology, or structure, of the clearing network. We also derive a CCP's Maximum-Exposure-at-Risk, which provides a metric for evaluating the adequacy of the CCP's and general clearing members loss-absorbing financial resources during rare but plausible market conditions. Based on our analysis, we provide insight into how clearing-network structure can affect the maximum-exposure risk of a CCP and, thereby, network stability. We show that the rate function (the exponential decay rate) of the maximum-exposure probability is informative and can be used to compare the relative maximum-exposure risks across different network configurations. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Central counterparty; Clearing; Large deviations theory; Network analysis; Systemic risk",,"Song, R.; Department of Mathematics, , Urbana, IL 61801, United States; email: ruisong2@illinois.edu",,,15326349,,,,"English","Stochastic Models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894557266

The regulator conducts stress tests against each bank to keep capital requirements in check. However, the regulator can only stress test each bank individually. Using the language of SoS, the regulator can stress test components, usually at different snapshots in time, and does not have the tools to stress test the whole SoS through analytic synthesis. The interconnecting links between banks is the missing part of such a systemic stress test. Empirical financial indicators are of great value in providing synthetic information as they act as aggregators of market participants’ positions and intelligence. In this case study, we will develop a simple indicator and heat maps based on credit default swaps (CDSs) that act as a proxy for banks’ credit risk.

Institutional investors, mostly pension funds and insurance companies, were considered to have a positive effect on financial stability because of their long-term investment strategy and funding. The recent financial crisis and its impact on financial market stability revealed serious systemic risk and interconnections between movements on financial markets and institutional investors' investment behaviour. Their investment policy, outflows and fire sales on the financial market had a great impact on market stability and deepening of the financial crisis.

Research Design & Methods: The analysis is based on classical and modern literature findings and analysis of newest statistical data. Findings: Despite their purpose to hedge from risks, derivative contracts are risky as every financial activity in the market. The analysis led to the conclusion, that the main risks typical for derivatives contracts and their traders are market risk, liquidity risk, credit and counterparty risk, legal risk and transactions risk. Pricing risk and systemic risk is also quite important. The analysis showed that market risk is the most important kind of risk that in many situations influences the level of remaining risks. Market risk occurs when the investor misjudges the market direction, counterparty risk occurs when misjudgement refers to the business partner. Some risks exist despite the employment of derivatives. Implications & Recommendations: It was suggested that risk of derivative contracts can be related with the following factors: Main characteristics of contracts; trading conditions; position assumed in the contract; complexity of the contract. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in studying various aspects of risk factors influencing the risks of derivative securities and suggested classification of these factors. © 2014, Cracow University of Economics.

Most recently in November 2014 the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane Australia endorsed a raft of measures on issues such as: financial inclusion, global infrastructure and accountability assessment processes, thereby building on the work of international regulatory actors such as the Financial Stability Board and the International Monetary Fund. In this paper we propose that contemporary international regulatory efforts in the finance sector to generate improvements in areas such as: raising standards of behaviour by both individual and organisational finance actors; promoting higher levels of financial citizenship; strengthening international benchmarks; and mitigating systemic risk in capital markets can benefit from examining how multilateral initiatives in environmental protection have emerged. We propose that notions of the commons as a governance philosophy have not only underpinned how many climate change regulatory responses have evolved, but can also provide valuable insights into how fair and effective financial markets might be sustained. To this end we provide a case study on the establishment of the world’s largest carbon trading market, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, which was built on a philosophical foundation of concern for the commons mediated by national and regional interest perspectives. © 2014, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

The social system must be seen as an automatic control system where the automatic controllers are linked to the decision-choice system. The economic structure is the foundation of life; the political structure is the foundation of social decision-making power and; the legal structure is the foundation of the social control and stability regarding the individual and collective decision-choice behavior in the three structures. In this respect, the political structure, endowed with the decision-making power, shapes and manages all three structures for coherence, stability and systemic risk associated with the collective decision-choice system of the political economy. At the same time, it is also shaped by the interactive behaviors of the three structures as they affect the social existence.

To follow and appreciate the complexity of the financial-paper game and the corresponding rent-seeking activities, we must keep in mind that the political economy is such that the two sectors are connected to define the production-consumption process. The connection reveals itself in the framework where the financial sector’s output goes to support the real income distribution and lubricate the exchange flows of goods and services. Additionally, it provides the service of real-value storage for real-value claims through the creation of financial assets. It also provides a mode of wealth-transfers and increasing individual or group purchasing power through credit or debt creation in reconciling conflicts between the deficit and surplus spenders in the real sector. Debt creation and buying and selling of debt are simply continual transfers of real claims over commodities and services from surplus-spenders to deficit-spenders and vice versa through a complicated system of creation of financial assets or different forms of IOUs or financial instruments and complex institutions of the debt market and sub-markets for marketing different grades of risk-income profiles. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,"Dompere, K.K.; Department of Economics, United States; email: kdompere@Howard.edu",,"Springer International Publishing",21984182,,,,"English","Stud.

The current philosophy is informed by an emphasis on structure, leaving it to market participants to self-police through a combination of rules and principles. It is informed by a high degree of trust in market ordering and acceptance of conflicts of interest as long as they are managed, thereby delivering beneficial outcomes. Specialisation and expertise are deemed to ensure that risk-taking takes place in fair, orderly and transparent markets. The global financial crisis has severely tested that assumption. As in other markets, trust in the integrity of financial markets and their participants has evaporated. The key policy question is whether the operation of the financial system is, in the vernacular, “fairdinkum”, according to or deviating from Australian belief in fairness. The paper explores the defects in the regulatory paradigm through each of the key themes: (i) balancing competition, innovation, efficiency, stability and consumer protection; (ii) how financial risk is allocated and systemic risk is managed; (iii) assessing the effectiveness and need for financial regulation, including its impact on costs, flexibility, innovation, industry and among users; and (iv) the role of government; and the role, objectives, funding and performance of financial regulators including an international comparison. The evaluation demonstrates profound limitations with the current paradigm. We argue that culture is a critical driver of behaviour. It can justify, embed or restrain action but ought to do so in light of institutional purpose. Unless the underpinning philosophy defines duties and responsibilities as well as rights, and links this to a framework that place culture at its core, we risk failing to learn from history. This would be both tragedy and farce. © 2014, Taylor and Francis Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17521440,,,,"English","Law Financ. Mark.

Complexity and network theory which can help identify the extent to which the financial system is resilient to contagion as well as the nature of major triggers and channels of contagion. However, the methodological suitability of the premises of complexity theory for financial systems is still debatable. The use of complexity analysis in finance draws on two distinct but related strands of theory: econophysics and econobiology. Each strand is associated with advantages and drawbacks in explaining the dynamics of financial systems. Properly combined, these theories could form a coherent body of theoretical premises that are capable of approximating reality in financial systems, i.e. explain the “stylized facts”, better than the traditional financial analysis model, which is crucially based on the false conception of a Gaussian distribution of financial returns. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,"Mertzanis, C.; Department of Management, AUC Avenue, PO Box 74, Egypt; email: charilaos.mertzanis@aucegypt.edu",,"Springer International Publishing",19316828,,,,"English","Springer Optim.

At the collective level, they can be used as a mean of communication to support the discussion, comparison and exploration of different understandings. The exploration of multiple perspectives of contextual understanding avoids entrapment in various types of reductionism and eliminates tendencies towards a deterministic reasoning and the pursuit of one optimum solution. A critical challenge is first developing a large spectrum of alternatives and then managing how the differences and similarities between alternatives will be handled to efficiently support decisions in information systems security (ISS).

The application includes the building stock (BDG), the electric power network (EPN), the water supply system (WSS) and the road network (RDN) with specific interdependencies between systems. The seismic hazard model is based on the seismic zones proposed in the SHARE project (Giardini et al., Seismic hazard harmonization in Europe (SHARE). Online data resource, http://​portal.​share-eu.​org:​8080/​jetspeed/​portal/​. doi:10.​12686/​SED-00000001-SHARE, 2013). For each system, the main features for the systemic analysis and the system topology and characteristics are described. Then the analysis results are presented. They include damages, casualties (deaths, injuries) and displaced people for BDG and connectivity-based Performance Indicators (PIs) for EPN, WSS and RDN systems. Apart from the average performance and the Mean Annual Frequency (MAF) of exceedance of the PIs, the distribution of estimated damages and losses for specific events is also given through thematic maps. The significant elements for the functionality of each system are defined through correlation factors to the system PIs. Finally, representative results of the shelter demand analysis are given. They are based on a multi-criteria approach that takes into account the outcomes of the systemic risk analysis for buildings and utility systems as well as other indicators. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.",,,"Argyroudis, S.; Department of Civil Engineering, Greece; email: sarg@civil.auth.gr",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",15736059,9789401788342,,,"English","Geotech.

We address the often-asked question of whether there are significant methodological differences in rating Islamic banks compared with conventional banks. An eclectic view is taken of the role of credit rating agencies to examine the necessary conditions for the rating of Islamic banking and products to be effective not only in mitigating systemic risks but also in furthering the development of Islamic financial institutions, products and services. The latter is achieved through bridging the information gaps between depositors and borrowers, on the one hand, and between issuers and investors of Islamic banking services and financial products, on the other.

One of the most significant insights was the role of systemic risk in destabilizing financial markets. Systemic risk does not refer to a sudden massive financial shock. It is better understood as a process – the buildup of fragilities in a financial system over a period of many years, that comes unstuck through a normal shock. Systemic risks originate from two primary causes – common exposures to aggregate risks, such as common exposures to the real estate market built up through the propagation of subprime mortgage related assets through the US financial system in the years leading up to the 2007–08 financial crisis, and/or the distress or failure of any large/complicated/highly interconnected financial institution that may lead to runs on other solvent institutions, fire-sale liquidations and heightened counterparty risk. These insights into systemic risk have underpinned global attempts to redress regulatory failures that allowed them to build up in the first place. Under the aegis of the G20, the Financial Stability Board has coordinated international standard-setters to address issues underlying systemic risks. © Asian Development Bank 2014.",,,"Moshirian, F.; Institute of Global Finance, Australia",,"Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.",,9781783477944; 9781783477937,,,"English","Global Shock, Risks, and Asian Financial Reform",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959141232

Since 2010 we find ourselves in a fully blown sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which to a substantial extent was caused by local mortgage credit booms with lending patterns and house price inflation very similar to those in the U.S. European countries in mortgage crisis include Ireland, Spain and Hungary. Waiting in the wings are others sitting on inflated house prices and hoping for a ‘soft landing’. Even though European mortgage default rates are below U.S. rates, the scale of problems, and as we will see the analogies of their causes, suggest that it is fair to speak of a transatlantic crisis. The weight of residential mortgage lending in balance sheets invariably means banking crisis, and where regulated banking has been replaced ‘shadow banking’ crisis. As governments rescue lenders, the resulting pressure for fiscal and wage austerity, as well as higher unemployment, in a feedback effect enhances pressure on house prices and portfolio quality.

At best, this belief is incomplete; at worst, it is wrong and dangerous. This chapter presents an inductive argument explaining the proliferation of club goods in modern investment finance. I argue that this proliferation has occurred because investment banks create club goods and club good market structures in order to lower risk and increase financial return. In the past, club good structures defined the organizational nature of small merchant and investment banking partnerships. I argue that the disappearance of partnerships as an organizational structure pushed more club good structure into financial products (see Selmier 2013a, for more detail on this). Governance of financial markets assumes all financial products are private goods and does not take into account the presence of club goods. In order to retain dynamism in financial markets while lowering systemic risks, we must grasp the club goods nature of many financial products. To analyze this nature, I borrow from structural perspectives from the public choice and environmental economics literatures, which empower us with better governance ideas. © Thomas Oatley and W.

Such challenges are exemplified by one of the first descriptions of RVT in the literature in 1837 in which Pierre Rayer described the association between RVT and infancy. Three years later he described the association between nephrotic syndrome and RVT [3].These first descriptions are fitting as the vast majority of cases occur in the neonatal period while the rare cases that do occur outside this period are typically associated with either primary or secondary renal disease or local vascular compression. Many of the first descriptions of RVT were reported in the European literature from the 1840s to the 1920s [3,4]. Subsequently, from the 1920s to the 1960s, the descriptions of RVT were noted mostly in the setting of its discovery at the time of surgery in a decompensating neonate followed by nephrectomy or at autopsy [5-7]. Although described nearly 190 years ago, the exact etiology of RVT remains still largely unknown but is likely related to the underlying disease, host characteristics and local and systemic risk factors. These factors include a reduced renal perfusion in the perinatal period, local inflammation and/or vascular obstruction, and coagulation-related issues either related to developmental hemostasis (i.e., the physiologic reduction of natural anticoagulants early in life) or to an inherited/;acquired thrombophilia trait. In fact, thrombophilia was not recognized as a potential association until the 1990s, when most of the currently recognized inherited traits were characterized and initially thought to be the etiology of many pediatric thrombotic events. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139028882; 9781107014541,,,"English","Pediatric Thromb.

Instead, it is a far deeper historical progression, which has given rise to fundamental questions about the governing relationships within Europe between legitimate democratic process, the effective exercise of political and administrative power, the deployment of technical expertise and the (autonomous) operation of market forces.1 Against this backdrop, the establishment in late 2010 of a European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) might be understood as an immediate EU response to financial meltdown.

International regulatory reform efforts identified macro-prudential regulatory and supervisory weaknesses that allowed financial institutions to expand their balance sheets, along with their leverage, without regard to risks that were building up across the financial system. Central bankers failed to understand the linkages between monetary policy and prudential financial regulation and, in particular, how accommodative interest rate policies can cause asset price bubbles and high levels of leverage in the financial system which can result in a severe economic downturn. The prevailing approach to prudential regulation at the time of the crisis was essentially micro-prudential, that is, it was concerned mainly with the stability of individual financial institutions, and the management of risks on bank balance sheets, while ignoring structural risks across the financial system, such as asset price correlations, aggregate levels of leverage and counter-party credit and liquidity risks in wholesale securities and derivatives markets, and the role of interest rates and exchange rates in propagating these risks across markets and countries. The main focus of macro-prudential regulation, in contrast, is to mitigate systemic risks across the financial system, which involves recognising the linkages between institutions and investors across markets and the risks embedded in complex financial instruments and the infrastructure of the financial system. Macro-prudential supervision could include, for example, monitoring cross-border capital movements and exchange rates, interest rates and the rate of growth of credit and the money supply relative to the rate of the growth in the broader economy. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,"Alexander, K.; University of ZurichSwitzerland",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781107479920; 9781107063631,,,"English","The Rule of Law in Monetary Affairs: World Trade Forum",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953320300

But this is not the only one; other factors related to macroeconomic, structural and financial policies, are also relevant in that regard. This chapter seeks to examine the contribution that the World Trade Organization (WTO) can make in its three areas of activities – negotiations, rule-making and dispute settlement – to deal with trade imbalances and with the main factors leading to them, including exchange rate misalignments. Beyond that, this chapter also touches on the need to correct failures in international cooperation, which have allowed such imbalances to pose such a threat to the global economy. © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781107479920; 9781107063631,,,"English","The Rule of Law in Monetary Affairs: World Trade Forum",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953258625

They interact both ‘horizontally’ and ‘vertically’ in order to produce and protect interdependent ‘aggregate public goods’, such as an efficient world trading system and price and financial stability, through mutually coherent rules and institutions. While the Agreement establishing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1947) were designed as mutually complementary instruments for protecting an efficient world trading system based on stable exchange rates and freedom of payments, financial regulation continues to be essentially based on national law and ‘soft rules’. There is no adequate international regulation of financial cross-border problems, such as capital requirements, prudential standards, disclosure and transparency of systemically important financial institutions, their restrictive business practices and bankruptcy procedures for global banks. Transnational cooperation among central banks and banking regulators, sovereign wealth funds and sovereign debt crises likewise lacks adequate multilateral treaty regulation to avoid systemic risks. The financial crises since 2008 not only revealed failures of financial markets (e.g., in terms of self-regulation of banks, proper evaluation of lending risks to eurozone member countries, such as Greece), but also failures in regulation and in supervision by national and international monetary, financial and related governance institutions. This chapter clarifies interrelationships between ‘governments’ and ‘multilevel governance’ (Section B) and the need for justifying governance regimes (Section C) before explaining why political, economic and legal theories of multilevel governance remain contested and incoherent (Section D). In order to promote transnational rule of law for the benefit of citizens, multilevel governance needs to be constituted, limited and justified by coherent ‘constitutional principles’ (Section E). These findings apply to monetary and financial affairs no less than to the multilevel governance of the world trading system. The interrelated monetary, financial and trading systems require stronger ‘multilevel regulation’ of ‘governance failures’ and judicial protection of cosmopolitan rights and transnational rule of law in order to operate more efficiently and legitimately for the benefit of citizens (Section F). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,"Petersmann, E.-U.; Department of the European University Institute (EUI)Italy",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781107479920; 9781107063631,,,"English","The Rule of Law in Monetary Affairs: World Trade Forum",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953217672

The impact of this, along with other circumstances, has led to the greatest financial restructuring ever made to date in Spain, with important macroeconomic and microeconomic consequences. This paper studies the determinants of delinquency (loan default) in Spanish credit institutions for the period of 2004-2011 and introduces new variables that have been disclosed as relevant in the current financial crisis as well as others non-previously considered internal variables, such as hedging derivatives (which are having an increasingly greater importance in accounts of Spanish credit institutions). Among the most prominent variables that have had a significant impact on the increase of delinquency are, among external variables, house prices, unemployment rates and the number of companies declaring bankruptcy and, among internal variables, property investment, customer credits over active, interest rate, participated companies and solvency rates. The analysis also shows significant differences in delinquency's behavior between savings banks and banks and between credit institutions that needed recapitalization and those that did not. © 2014 Enock T.

In a continuous-time framework, this model enables us to solve a stochastic optimal credit default insurance problem that has investor consumption and investment in structured mortgage products as controls.

As practiced, common methods rest upon input measures from experts, in particular to evaluate the probability and effect of a risk. Limitations are well known, including errors, disparate use of qualitative measures, biases and overconfidence, prioritization and focus on local effect rather than systemic value, and meaningless combined exposure scores. By viewing the engineering project as a sociotechnical system, we consider human expertise not as constraint but as fundamental to the system. Rather than removal of human judgment, we seek to position people to leverage existing judgment within limits of relevance while stimulating attention and learning towards systemically relevant options. We propose the design of projects that incorporate human attention in identification and response to risks as learning and coordination within the project's broader sociotechnical architecture. © 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.","Engineering project management; Plans; Risk; Sociotechnical systems; Systemic risk; Uncertainty","Concurrent engineering; Product development; Project management; Risk assessment; Risks; Engineering project; Human attention; Human expertise; Plans; Sociotechnical systems; Systemic risks; Uncertainty; Unexpected events; Risk management",,"Curran R.Xu W.Chou S.-Y.Cha J.Stjepandic J.","IOS Press BV",,9781614994398,,,"English","Adv.

It then failed to capture the contribution of systemic risk, which is considered to be the risk that results from the collective behavior of financial institutions that have significant effects on the real economy. In this chapter, we investigate the extent to which distress within different sub-segments of the financial system, namely, the banking, insurance and other financial services industries contribute to systemic risk. We conduct our analysis using the measure of systemic risk recently developed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We employ weekly data for the period December 1995-February 2013 for selected countries from three regions of emerging economies, namely, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe. Our main results provide evidence that in most of the emerging markets under investigation, the banking industry contributes relatively more to systemic risk in periods of distress than does the insurance industry or the other financial services industry. Furthermore, when we examine the estimated δCoVaR measures we observe that for all industries the contribution to systemic risks has increased since 2008. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In fact, the Commission is of the view that alternative investment funds may pose systemic risk because other financial institutions, such as banks, may be exposed to them and thus be subject to the macro-prudential and micro-prudential risks of hedge fund behaviour. The authors focus on the prudential and risk management regulation, in order to verify if it is able to protect the investor and the market's integrity. Although the AIFM Directive has responded to the financial stability and systemic risk rationales for regulating alternative investment funds, the prudential regulatory regime may be too standardised with the UCITS and MiFID regimes, lacking consideration of some of the unique features of AIFMs, and also too procedural in nature, allowing AIFMs considerable discretion in determining their own levels of safety and soundness.

In Newtonian times, mathematical models were mainly applied to physics and astronomy (e.g., planetary systems) as definitive mappings of reality. They aimed at explanations of past events and predictions of future events. Models and theories were empirically corroborated or falsified by observations, measurements and lab experiments. Mathematical predictions were reduced to uniquely determined solutions of equations and the strong belief in one model as mapping of reality. In probabilistic models, extreme events were underestimated as improbable risks according to normal distribution. The adjective normal indicates the problematic assumption that the Gaussian curve indicates a kind of natural distribution of risks ignoring the fat tails of extreme events. The remaining risks are trivialized. The last financial crisis as well as the nuclear disaster in Japan are examples of extreme events which need new approaches of modeling. Mathematical models are interdisciplinary tools used in natural and engineering sciences as well as in financial, economic and social sciences. Is there a universal methodology for turbulence and the emergence of risks in nature and financial markets? Risks which cannot be reduced to single causes, but emerge from complex interactions in the whole system, are called systemic risk. They play a dominant role in a globalized world. What is the difference between microscopic interactions of molecules and microeconomic behavior of people? Obviously, we cannot do experiments with people and markets in labs. Here, the new role of computer simulations and data mining comes in. These models are mainly stochastic and probabilistic and can no longer be considered as definitive mappings of reality. The reason is that, for example, a financial crisis cannot be predicted like a planetary position. With this methodic misunderstanding, the political public blamed financial mathematics for failing anticipations. Actually, probabilistic models should serve as stress tests. Model ambiguity does not allow to distinguish a single model as definitive mapping of reality. We have to consider a whole class of possible stochastic models with different weights. In this way, we can overcome the old philosophical skepticism against mathematical predictions from David Hume to Nassim Taleb. They are right in their skepticism against classical axiomatization of human rationality. But they forget the extreme usefulness of robust stochastic tools if they are used with sensibility for the permanent model ambiguity. It is the task of philosophy of science to evaluate risk modeling and to consider their interdisciplinary possibilities and limits. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Despite practices in risk management, unexpected events leading to unacceptable outcomes continue to happen. As practiced, common methods rest upon input measures from experts, in particular to evaluate the probability and effect of a risk. Limitations are well known, including errors, disparate use of qualitative measures, biases and overconfidence, prioritization and focus on local effect rather than systemic value, and meaningless combined exposure scores. By viewing the engineering project as a sociotechnical system, we consider human expertise not as constraint but as fundamental to the system. Rather than removal of human judgment, we seek to position people to leverage existing judgment within limits of relevance while stimulating attention and learning towards systemically relevant options. We propose the design of projects that incorporate human attention in identification and response to risks as learning and coordination within the project's broader sociotechnical architecture. © 2014 The Authors and Ios Press.","Engineering project management; Plans; Risk; Sociotechnical systems; Systemic risk; Uncertainty","Concurrent engineering; Project management; Risk management; Risks; Engineering project; Human expertise; Human judgments; Plans; Sociotechnical systems; Systemic risks; Uncertainty; Unexpected events; Risk assessment",,"Chou S.-Y.Stjepandic J.Xu W.Cha J.Curran R.","IOS Press BV",,9781614994398,,,"English","Mov.

When Citicorp merged with Travelers to form Citigroup in 1998, Citigroup's leaders and supporters asserted that the new financial conglomerate would offer unparalleled convenience to its customers through 'one-stop shopping' for banking, securities and insurance services. They also claimed that Citigroup would have a superior ability to withstand financial shocks due to its broadly diversified activities. By 2009, those bold predictions of Citigroup's success had turned to ashes. Citigroup pursued a high-risk, high-growth strategy during the 2000s that proved to be disastrous. As a result, the bank recorded more than US$130 billion of losses on its loans and investments from 2007 to 2009. To prevent Citigroup's failure, the federal government provided $45 billion of new capital to the bank and gave the bank $500 billion of additional help in the form of asset guarantees, debt guarantees and emergency loans. The federal government provided more financial assistance to Citigroup than to any other bank during the financial crisis. During its early years, Citigroup was embroiled in a series of high-profile scandals, including tainted transactions with Enron and WorldCom, biased research advice, corrupt allocations of shares in initial public offerings, predatory subprime lending, and market manipulation in foreign bond markets. Notwithstanding a widely publicized plan to improve corporate risk controls in 2005, Citigroup continued to pursue higher profits through a wide range of speculative activities, including leveraged corporate lending, packaging toxic subprime loans into mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, and dumping risky assets into off-balance-sheet conduits for which Citigroup had contractual and reputational exposures. Post-mortem evaluations of Citigroup's near-collapse revealed that neither Citigroup's managers nor its regulators recognized the systemic risks embedded in the bank's farflung operations. Thus, Citigroup was not only too big to fail but also too large and too complex to manage or regulate effectively. Citigroup's history raises deeply troubling questions about the ability of bank executives and regulators to supervise and control today's megabanks. Citigroup's original creators - John Reed of Citicorp and Sandy Weill of Travelers - admitted in recent years that Citigroup's universal banking model failed, and they called on Congress to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act's separation between commercial and investment banks. As Reed and Weill acknowledged, the universal banking model is deeply flawed by its excessive organizational complexity, its vulnerability to culture clashes and conflicts of interest, and its tendency to permit excessive risk-taking within far-flung, semi-autonomous units that lack adequate oversight from either senior managers or regulators. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Citigroup; Managerial; Regulatory failures; Too-big-to-fail; Universal banks",,"Wilmarth, A.E.; George Washington University Law School, 2000 H Street N.W., United States",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",17456452,,,,"English","J.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients treated with 50% AS eye drops at our institution between June 2008 and January 2013. Records were reviewed for clinical history, systemic risk factors, dry eye etiology, patients' symptoms, and adverse events. Ocular surface evaluation included Schirmer testing with topical anesthesia, fluorescein staining, and ocular surface disease index. Data were reviewed at initial visit, 1 month, and every 3 to 6 months during treatment with AS. Paired t tests were performed to compare the progression of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Results: A total of 123 eyes of 63 patients were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-48 months). Corneal fluorescein staining (mean baseline, 1.77 ± 1.1) improved at the 3- to < 6-month, 6- to <12-month, and final follow-up (mean: 1.2 ± 1.0, 1.3 ± 1.0, and 1.1 ± 1.1; P = 0.003, 0.017, and 0.0003, respectively). Schirmer scores (mean baseline, 6.6 ± 6.5 mm) improved at the 12- to 24-month follow-up (mean = 10.7 ± 11.4, P = 0.03), whereas ocular surface disease index scores (mean baseline, 54.1 ± 22.3) improved at the 3- to <6- and 6- to <12-month follow-up (mean: 49.5 ± 8.2 and 39.3 ± 21.4, P = 0.029 and 0.003, respectively). No complications were noted.

If external shocks or excess loads at some agents are propagated to the other connected agents due to failure, the domino effects often come with disastrous consequences. In this paper, we design the least susceptible network to systemic risk. We consider the threshold-based cascade model, proposed by Watts [13]. We propose the network design model in which the associated adjacency matrix has the largest maximum eigenvalue. The topology of such a network is characterized as a core-periphery structures that consists of a partial complete graph of hub nodes and stub nodes that are connected to one of the hub nodes. The introduced network can reduce the turbulence of shocks triggered and prevent the spread of systemic risk. By both mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations, we show that the slightly differences of the structure of network causes systemic risk. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014",,,"Zamami, R.; Department of computer science, National Defense Academy of JapanJapan",,"Springer Verlag",00758442,,,,"English","Lect.

Organizations have to face systemic risks they cannot influence. They have to become more resilient to survive or recover from crises and have to become more efficient to stay successful under the pressure of worldwide competition, at the same time. The goal of this research project was to develop a resilience management framework that allows to control internal risks and to prepare for external risks so that more effective strategies can be applied. The framework provides the benefit of implementing, running and controlling resilience in any type of organization by means of one integrated steering model. The research approach bases on the design science methodology including the analysis of real world requirements, the development of a management framework and the evaluation of the framework. It assures that the new framework provides added value for the governance of organizations in complex environments, including well-orchestrated prevention, intervention and recovery activities over the entire organizational lifecycle. As results, cybernetic process models were developed which allow to monitor, to assess and to shift the risks on and the resilience of involved resources. A new management model was designed which integrates the two organizational resilience paradigms of 'planning and control' and 'culture-based management'. The combination of these models into one organizational resilience management framework constitutes the final solution that is applicable for all types of large organizations.","Business continuity management; Crisis management; Integrated control system; Resilience management framework; Risk management","Design; Integrated control; Risk assessment; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Business continuity management; Complex environments; Crisis management; Design science methodologies; Large organizations; Management frameworks; Planning and control; Socio-economic systems; Research and development management","Preis, A.; Vienna University of TechnologyAustria","Stal M.Sigrist D.Ammann W.","Global Risk Forum (GRF)",,,,,"English","Proc.

This study advocates the need for disaster preparedness strategies to go beyond linear risk management approaches to also address systemic risks. Linear thinking has proved adequate to deal with risks that can be identified a priori. However, the uncertainty increasingly posed by natural and human-made disasters arises from both known risks and a range of unforeseeable risks, some of which have not been observed before. These interconnected risks unfold over short periods of time and interact with each other. In a network of multiple causes and effects, such risks may not be foreseeable at the disaster preparedness level, and may only be identified at the time of disaster response. The resulting higher level of complexity requires the integration of new thinking and decision-making at the disaster preparedness level. Using complex system thinking and socio-ecological notions of resilience, this paper presents a conceptual framework to illustrate key differences between building specified and general resilience, that is, resilience to known and unknown risks. Acknowledging and planning for uncertainty allows disaster risk reduction strategies to expand beyond risk mitigation paradigms to integrate policies that take into consideration systems' thresholds for maintaining a safe operating space - so allowing better preparation for unknown risks.","Emerging and cascading risks; Preventive action; Resilience framework; System of systems; Unknown","Complex networks; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Large scale systems; Risk management; System of systems; Conceptual frameworks; Disaster management; Disaster preparedness; Disaster risk reductions; Integral features; Preventive action; Resilience framework; Unknown; Disasters","Cavallo, A.; Entrepreneurship, Commercialisation and Innovation Centre (ECIC), University of AdelaideAustralia","Stal M.Sigrist D.Ammann W.","Global Risk Forum (GRF)",,,,,"English","Proc.

The neural network is trained using historical project data, supported by data obtained from interviews with project managers. Expected value analysis is achieved in a risk register format employing a binomial distribution to estimate the number of risks expected.

We develop a network approach to the amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a generalized branching process. This can be used to compute the stability for any particular configuration of portfolios. By studying a stylized model we estimate the circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. There is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases. Note that our model assumes passive portfolio management during a crisis; however, we show that dynamic deleveraging during a crisis can amplify instabilities. The financial system exhibits ""robust yet fragile"" behavior, with regions of the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Contagion; Network models; Systemic risk",,"Caccioli, F.; Centre for Risk Studies, Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, United Kingdom; email: fc390@cam.ac.uk",,,03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

In analogy to the theory ofGibbs measures in Statistical Mechanics,we focus on the structure of global convex risk measures which are consistent with a given family of local conditional risk measures. Going beyond the locally law-invariant (and hence entropic) case studied in [11], we show that a global risk measure can be characterized by its behavior on a suitable boundary field. In particular, a global risk measure may not be uniquely determined by its local specification, and this can be seen as a source of “systemic risk”, in analogy to the appearance of phase transitions in the theory of Gibbs measures.

Not only were banks one of the sources of this crisis but they also contributed to the diffusion of impulses for the crisis. The paper presents the evolution that banks have undergone in the last 30-40 years. The simple traditional model consisting in banks using deposits placed by households and enterprises for the purposes of granting credits (including especially investment credits for enterprises) has been replaced by a considerably more complicated model. The most important changes included the establishment of conglomerates and financial holding companies, the development of an alternative banking system, changes to the structure of credits granted by banks as well as to the sources of financing of the active bank operations, and to the process of integration of banks and financial markets. The main aim of this paper is to present how the changes in the banking sector have increased the potentially destabilizing influence of these institutions on the whole financial system and the real economy. The major reason was the increase in the systemic risk involved in the banking sector (resulting from the network of mutual interrelations and joint exposures) and intensification of the pro-cyclicality in bank lending. These threats have become fully perceivable in the years preceding the contemporary crisis and during the crisis.","Banks; Crisis; Financial markets; Pro-cyclicality; Systemic risk",,"Małecki, W.; Wyzsza Szkota Finansów i Zarządzania w WarszawiePoland",,"Polish Economic Society",00133205,,,,"Polish","Ekon.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916918346

Evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 μg/mL).Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis.Summary of Background Data: The application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population with minimal local and systemic risks. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery.Methods: Topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. Serum and drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (PODs). Complications were recorded.Results: The study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean ± standard deviation body weight of 44.5 ± 18 kg. Underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). Mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 μg/mL (POD 0) to 1.9 μg/mL (POD 1) to 1.1 μg/mL (POD 2). Mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 μg/mL (POD 0) to 251 μg/mL (POD 1) to 115 μg/mL (POD 2). No vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. One patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes.Conclusion: Topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 μg/mL). There were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications.

In this paper we propose to enrich the topological perspective of network models with a more structured statistical framework, that of Bayesian Gaussian graphical models. From a statistical viewpoint, we propose a new class of hierarchical Bayesian graphical models that can split correlations between institutions into country specific and idiosyncratic ones, in a way that parallels the decomposition of returns in the well-known Capital Asset Pricing Model. From a financial economics viewpoint, we suggest a way to model systemic risk that can explicitly take into account frictions between different financial markets, particularly suited to study the ongoing banking union process in Europe. From a computational viewpoint, we develop a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on Bayes factor thresholding.

Thirty percent of epilepsy patients between the ages of 5 and 25 develop seizures related to illness or accidents involving an injury to the head. Decision making for prevention and care is crucial for fighting morbidity and mortality of such disease. Considering the multiplicity of diagnostic and treatment alternatives the best sequence of such alternatives should be the objective to detect for any pathologist and specialized physician in treating patients. Here, we introduce a portfolio decision model for the optimal detection of coupled diagnostic and treatment alternatives. The model is composed by two multicriteria decision analysis models which assess the risk of diagnostic and treatment alternatives as a function of alternative criteria, individual- and context-dependent criteria of patients. The minimization of the sequential risk considering all combinations of alternatives and their costs determine Pareto efficient frontiers that provide optimal solutions to decrease the mortality risk due to epilepsy for any resource level available. Preliminary results show that traditional diagnostic and treatment alternatives (i.e., EEG and ketogenic diet, respectively) are the highest scoring diagnostic alternative considering efficacy, potential risks of misdiagnosis, execution time, and time to process the results of the tests. This happens because of the limited data and application of the most recent innovative alternatives. The portfolio decision model is a very flexible model for formalizing pathology into systems pathology in a quantitative fashion. The approach is largely adoptable for any disease other than epilepsy and it makes physicians decision making transparent and quantitative based. The model emphasizes the strong importance to consider population health criteria, individual factors, and sequential decisions simultaneously for minimizing the systemic risk of diseases over time.","Alternative portfolio selection; Diagnosis; Multicriteria decision analysis; Pareto optimization; Sequential decision making; Treatment","Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision theory; Diseases; Health risks; Ketones; Multiobjective optimization; Neurology; Pareto principle; Pathology; Patient treatment; Risk assessment; Risks; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Pareto optimization; Portfolio selection; Sequential decision making; Treatment; Diagnosis",,"Rizzoli A.E.Quinn N.W.T.Ames D.P.","International Environmental Modelling and Software Society",,,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

In particular, the theoretical foundations of risk management and the statistical calibration of risk models are called into question. Policy makers and practitioners respond by looking for new analytical approaches and tools to identify and address new sources of financial risk. Financial markets satisfy reasonable criteria of being considered complex adaptive systems, characterized by complex financial instruments and complex interactions among market actors. Policy makers and practitioners need to take both a micro and macro view of financial risk, identify proper transparency requirements on complex instruments, develop dynamic models of information generation that best approximate observed financial outcomes, and identify and address the causes and consequences of systemic risk. Complexity analysis can make a useful contribution. However, the methodological suitability of complexity theory for financial systems and by extension for risk management is still debatable. Alternative models drawn from the natural sciences and evolutionary theory are proposed.

Designing a safe and reliable architecture for a manned mission to Mars or the Asteroids necessitates strong cooperation during the early stages of design to prevent and reduce risks for the astronauts at each step of the mission. The stake during design is to deal with the contradictions, antagonisms and paradoxes of the involved partners for the definition and modeling of a shared project of reference. As we see in our research which analyses the cognitive and social aspects of technological risks in major accidents, in such a project, the complexity of the global organization (during design and use) and the integration of a wide and varie d range of sciences and innovative technologies is likely to increase systemic risks as follows: human and cultural mistakes, potential defaults, failures and accidents. We identify as the main danger antiquated centralized models of organization and the operational limits of interdisciplinarity in the sciences. Beyond this, we can see that we need to take carefully into account human cooperation and the quality of relations between heterogeneous partners. Designing an open, self-learning and reliable exploration system able to self-adapt in dangerous and unforeseen situations implies a collective networked intelligence led by a safe process that organizes interaction between the actors and the aims of the project.

As a sort of systemic risk, changes in banking risk lead to fluctuations in aggregate economic activity. We decompose the macroeconomic effect of a banking risk shock into a pure default effect and a risk-aversion effect when risk sharing among investors is imperfect. When the shock generates a bank risk spread similar to the peak value during the Global Financial Crisis, the overall effect is a decline in employment by 4.66%. The default effect leads to a 3.40% employment decline by a ""within-model"" measure, and a 3.51 decline by a ""between-model"" measure. The remaining is attributed to the risk-aversion effect. A practical implication of our analysis is that by developing financial safety net and improving risk sharing among investors, the society can mitigate the adverse macroeconomic effects of banking risk shocks to some extent, but cannot eliminate all of them. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Financial crisis; Systemic risk; Two-sided financial frictions",,"Jin, Y.; Department of Economics, Monash UniversityAustralia",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

Although they exhibit similar cash flow patterns (economic perspective) this article argues that from a legal, accounting and regulatory perspective credit default swaps (CDS) are not considered to be an insurance contract. The protection buyer of a CDS is eligible to obtain the compensation without suffering any loss (and potentially realizing a gain) whereas insurance policies only pay out to compensate a loss (and not potentially realizing a gain). This disconnect between protection and exposure is the source for potential over-coverage. Furthermore, the concentrated set of reference entities and (interbank) counterparties as well as their tradeability make CDS highly systemically significant products. Our conclusion is that CDS are not default insurance policies and their systemic risk potential sharply contrasts the limited systemic risk in the insurance industry. We propose to use “default protection” instead of “credit default insurance” to avoid the mislabelling. The legal classification of CDS as insurance contracts would have an enormous impact on the liquidity of CDs, as the ability of counterparties to issue and participate in CDS contracts would be limited. © Copyright by author(s).","Credit Default Insurance; Credit Default Swaps; Insurance Contract",,"Schmaltz, C.; Aarhus University, Denmark",,"CLUTE Institute",08927626,,,,"English","J.

We find that the likelihood of a primary insurer's downgrade increases with its reinsurance default risk exposure from downgraded reinsurers. Counterparty primary insurers' stocks also react negatively to their reinsurers' downgrades. The negative effects also spill over to insurers that are not directly exposed to the credit risk of downgraded reinsurers.

Evaluation of systemic risk is based on a detailed financial analysis of the insurance industry, its role in the economy, and the interconnectedness of insurers. The primary conclusion is that the core activities of U.S. insurers do not pose systemic risk. However, life insurers are vulnerable to intrasector crises, and both life and property-casualty insurers are vulnerable to reinsurance crises. Noncore activities such as financial guarantees and derivatives trading may cause systemic risk, and interconnectedness among financial institutions has grown significantly in recent years.

This provides a picture of how unregulated financial innovation pushes an economy towards the ideal limit of complete markets. Hedging new products with existing products allows financial institutions to reduce the associated risk and hence the risk premium. This has the expected consequence that markets, under such ideal conditions, converge to market completeness as the repertoire of financial instruments expands. As markets approach completeness, however, two 'unintended consequences' also arise: (i) equilibrium portfolios develop a marked susceptibility to idiosyncratic shocks and/or parameter uncertainty and (ii) hedging engenders divergent trading volumes in the interbank market. Combining these suggests an inverse relation between financial stability and the size of the financial sector, which can be quantified within the present framework. These results suggest that even under perfect competition and symmetric information, the pursuit of market efficiency-in terms of completeness-may erode financial stability. The proliferation of financial instruments exacerbates the effects of market imperfections and, in order to prevent an escalation of perverse effects, markets may require institutional structures that become more and more substantial as their complexity expands. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Complexity in finance; Equilibrium asset-pricing models; Financial stability; Statistical mechanics; Systemic risk",,"Marsili, M.; The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Strada Costiera 11, 34014, Trieste, Italy; email: marsili@ictp.it",,"Routledge",14697688,,,,"English","Quant.

Materials and methods CT images of the mandible were obtained from a total of 20 patients with BRONJ and 20 control subjects. BRONJ was classified into 2 groups, with bone exposure (Stage 1-3 BRONJ) or without (Stage 0 BRONJ). In each patient, 15 transaxial CT images were selected and 30 configured regions of interest (ROI) were identified. The ANOVA test was applied to test the relationship between the severity of systemic risk factors. Results Regarding the local status of the mandible, significant differences were observed among the Stage 0 BRONJ, Stage 1-3 BRONJ, non-BRONJ and control groups in the cancellous bone CT radiodensity values, but there were no significant differences between the Stage 0 and Stage 1-3 BRONJ groups. In the cortical bone widths, significant differences were observed only between BRONJ and the controls. Conclusions Measuring cancellous bone CT radiodensity value has the potential to be a simple and quantitative method to detect the early stages of BRONJ. © 2014 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

The hemodynamic force exerts on vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which could perceive the mechanical signals and transmit them into cell interior by multiple potential shear sensors, collectively known as mechanotransduction. However, we do not understand completely how these shear-sensitive components orchestrate physiological and atherosclerotic responses to shear stress. In this review, we provide an overview of biomechanical mechanisms underlying vascular physiology and atherosclerotic progression. Additionally, we summarize current evidences to illustrate that atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop in arterial regions experiencing disturbance in blood flow, during which endothelial dysfunction is the initial event of atherosclerosis, inflammation plays dominant roles in atherosclerotic progression, and angiogenesis emerges as compensatory explanation for atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Especially in the presence of systemic risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and hyperglycemia), the synergy between these systemic risk factors with hemodynamic factors aggravates atherosclerosis by co-stimulating some of these biomechanical events. Given the hemodynamic environment of vasculature, understanding how the rapid shear-mediated signaling, particularly in combination with systemic risk factors, contribute to atherosclerotic progression through endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and angiogenesis helps to elucidate the role for atherogenic shear stress in specifically localizing atherosclerotic lesions in arterial regions with disturbed flow. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","angiogenesis; atherosclerosis; inflammation; mechanotransduction; Shear stress; systemic risk factors","Biomechanics; Blood vessels; Endothelial cells; Hemodynamics; Pathology; Physiological models; Shear flow; Shear stress; Biomechanics; Blood; Blood vessels; Diseases; Endothelial cells; Hemodynamics; Pathology; Physiological models; Physiology; Shear stress; Angiogenesis; atherosclerosis; inflammation; Mechanotransduction; Systemic risks; Diseases; Shear flow","Wang, G.; Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Vascular Implants Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China; email: wanggx@cqu.edu.cn",,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

The MES of an institution can be defined as its expected equity loss when the market itself is in its left tail. We estimate the dynamic MES recently proposed by Brownlees and Engle (2012) for a panel of 68 large US banks over the last decade and a half. Running panel regressions of the MES on bank characteristics, we first find that the MES can be roughly rationalized in terms of standard balance-sheet indicators of bank financial soundness and systemic importance. We then ask whether the cross section of the MES can help to identify ex ante, i.e. before a crisis unfolds, which institutions are more likely to suffer the most severe losses ex post, i.e. once it has unfolded. Unfortunately, using the 2007-2009 crisis as a natural experiment, we find that some standard balance-sheet ratios are better able than the MES to predict large equity losses conditionally to a true crisis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Balance sheet ratios; MES; Panel; Systemic risk; Tail correlation",,"Mésonnier, J.-S.; Banque de France, Financial Economics Research Division, 39 rue Croix des Petits Champs, 75001 Paris, France; email: jean-stephane.mesonnier@banque-france.fr",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

An unintended consequence of deposit insurance is the reduction in the incentive of depositors to monitor banks which lead to excessive risk-taking. We examine the relation between deposit insurance and bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to and during the recent financial crisis. We find that generous financial safety nets increase bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. However, during the crisis, bank risk is lower and systemic stability is greater in countries with deposit insurance coverage. Our findings suggest that the ""moral hazard effect"" of deposit insurance dominates in good times while the ""stabilization effect"" of deposit insurance dominates in turbulent times. The overall effect of deposit insurance over the full sample we study remains negative since the destabilizing effect during normal times is greater in magnitude compared to the stabilizing effect during global turbulence. In addition, we find that good bank supervision can alleviate the unintended consequences of deposit insurance on bank systemic risk during good times, suggesting that fostering the appropriate incentive framework is very important for ensuring systemic stability. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Bank risk; Bank supervision and regulation; Deposit insurance; Financial crisis; Systemic risk",,"Anginer, D.; Pamplin College of Business, Virginia TechUnited States",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

We find that several insurers did indeed contribute significantly to the instability of the U.S. financial sector during the recent financial crisis. We empirically confirm that insurers that were most exposed to systemic risk were on average larger, relied more heavily on non-policyholder liabilities and had higher ratios of investment income to net revenues.

In our stylized system, banks can be in two states: normally operating or distressed and the state of a bank changes from normally operating to distressed whenever its liabilities are larger than the banks' assets. The banks are connected through an interbank lending network and, whenever a bank is distressed, its creditor cannot expect the loan from the distressed bank to be repaid, potentially becoming distressed themselves. We solve the problem analytically for a homogeneous system and test the robustness and generality of the results with simulations of more complex systems. We investigate the parameter space and the corresponding distribution of operating banks mapping the conditions under which the whole system is stable or unstable. This allows us to determine how financial stability of a banking system is influenced by regulatory decisions, such as leverage; we discuss the effect of central bank actions, such as quantitative easing and we determine the cost of rescuing a distressed banking system using re-capitalisation.

Downs Blvd, MDC Box 22, Tampa, FL 33612, United States","Oral health is integrally linked to overall well-being. This article describes a research program focused on the contribution of poor oral health to systemic illness. Initial investigations examined factors related to streptococcal virulence that were important in dental caries and endocarditis and led to development of immunization strategies in animal models to reduce risk of endocarditis. Clinical investigations related to critically ill adults began with descriptive and observational studies that established the importance of dental plaque in development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and examined existing nursing practices in oral care. Subsequent intervention studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to test oral care protocols in critically ill adults have built on that foundation. The group's first NIH-funded randomized clinical trial tested the effects of toothbrushing and use of chlorhexidine in reducing risk of VAP in critically ill adults and showed that VAP was reduced by topical application of chlorhexidine initiated after intubation, although toothbrushing did not reduce VAP. The study had a rapid and dramatic effect on clinical practice. Results of the study were published in September 2009 in the American Journal of Critical Care, and in May 2010, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement updated the recommendations for the care of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (the ventilator bundle) to include daily oral care with chlorhexidine, referencing the results of that study as evidence for the change. Chlor - hexidine is now the standard of care for adults receiving mechanical ventilation. Because the effects of chlorhexidine after intubation were so beneficial, a second recently completed NIH-funded randomized clinical trial investigated the impact of chlorhexidine applied before intubation compared with after intubation. Currently a large randomized clinical trial is being launched to determine the optimal frequency of toothbrushing for critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation in an effort to maximize oral health benefits while minimizing systemic risks. The importance of collaboration and mentoring in building nursing science is discussed. Future directions for research also are explored. © 2014 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.",,"chlorhexidine; topical antiinfective agent; adverse effects; animal; endotracheal intubation; human; intensive care nursing; microbiology; mouth; mouth hygiene; nursing research; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; tooth brushing; topical drug administration; Administration, Topical; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Chlorhexidine; Critical Care Nursing; Humans; Intubation, Intratracheal; Mouth; Nursing Research; Oral Hygiene; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Toothbrushing","Munro, C.L.; Research and Innovation, University of South Florida College of Nursing, 12901 Bruce B.

The paper offers four solutions to strengthen bank governance. First, the regulatory capital base of banks could be increased. Second, the compensation structure of managers could be reformed. Third, effort could be focussed on creating and implementing resolution regimes which offer the credible prospect of ""bailing-in"" creditors in the event of stress and fourth solution is to reform the structure of company law- for example, by extending control rights beyond shareholders. Furthermore, the paper argues that given the diversity of the whole financial system, it is expected that the risks individual financial institutions face are also diverse. It cannot be assumed that the appropriate capitalisation is constant across all risks. While leverage ratios are a useful backstop measure and guard against potential gaming of risk-weights, their appropriate role is as a backstop. The diversity within the financial system also supports the fact that a single measure of systemic risk is unlikely to be universally applicable, nor is a single instrument of financial stability policy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bank governance; Financial stability; Systemic risk",,"Moshirian, F.; Institute of Global Finance, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; email: f.moshirian@unsw.edu.au",,"Elsevier",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

Using this measure we find that banks' aggregate holdings of five classes of derivatives do not exhibit a significant effect on the bank's contribution to systemic risk. On the contrary, the banks' holdings of certain specific types of derivatives such as foreign exchange and credit derivatives increase the banks contributions to systemic risk whereas holdings of interest rate derivatives decrease it. Nevertheless, the proportion of non-performing loans over total loans and the leverage ratio have much stronger impact on systemic risk than derivatives holdings. Therefore, the derivatives' impact plays a second fiddle in comparison with traditional banking activities related to the former two items. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Derivatives; Shapley value; Systemic risk",,"Rodriguez-Moreno, M.; University of Navarra, , 31009 Pamplona, Spain; email: mrodriguezm@unav.es",,"Elsevier B.V.",03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

The SSRI measures the aggregate level of risk across all federally insured banks and indicates the industry's sensitivity to systemic events. Since the 2008 recession, the government and the public have searched for ways to analyze elevated levels of risk to prevent future recessions or financial collapses, and this index hopes to address those concerns. The focus of this study was to examine the SSRI as a leading indicator of banking risk and determine the index's relationship with other macroeconomic variables. The SSRI has been compiled for every quarter since 1984, so time series analyses were performed. Additionally, simple and vector autoregressive models were created to assess the relationships between the SSRI and economic indicators. Finally, hidden Markov models were created to examine how relationships changed during different states of the economy, particularly in conditions pre-and post-2008. A two state hidden Markov approach provides the most revealing and intuitive model to interpret changing market risk. The results of these comparisons yielded a statistically significant ability to detect risk. The preliminary simple and vector autoregressive models show that the SSRI is significantly correlated with factors such as 90-day Treasury bill rates, unemployment, commercial loans, and the consumer price index. The complexity of these modeling techniques presents a barrier to understanding for non-engineers. The team will utilize visualization techniques to present the results in an accessible form for individuals without a background in advanced statistics. These techniques will follow best design principles for clarity of graphics and intuitively explain the underlying models. © 2014 IEEE.","banking; hidden Markov model; systemic risk; systems analysis; visualization","Economics; Flow visualization; Hidden Markov models; Industry; Systems analysis; Time series analysis; banking; Consumer price index; Economic indicators; Macroeconomic indices; Macroeconomic variables; Systemic risks; Vector autoregressive model; Visualization technique; Risk assessment",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9781479948369,,,"English","IEEE Syst.

The application includes the building stock (BDG), the electric power network (EPN), the water supply system (WSS) and the road network (RDN) with specific interdependencies between systems. The seismic hazard model is based on the seismic zones proposed in the SHARE project (Giardini et al., Seismic hazard harmonization in Europe (SHARE). Online data resource, http://portal.share-eu.org:8080/jetspeed/portal/. doi:10.12686/SED-00000001-SHARE, 2013). For each system, the main features for the systemic analysis and the system topology and characteristics are described. Then the analysis results are presented. They include damages, casualties (deaths, injuries) and displaced people for BDG and connectivity-based Performance Indicators (PIs) for EPN, WSS and RDN systems. Apart from the average performance and the Mean Annual Frequency (MAF) of exceedance of the PIs, the distribution of estimated damages and losses for specific events is also given through thematic maps. The significant elements for the functionality of each system are defined through correlation factors to the system PIs. Finally, representative results of the shelter demand analysis are given. They are based on a multi-criteria approach that takes into account the outcomes of the systemic risk analysis for buildings and utility systems as well as other indicators. © Springer ScienceCBusiness Media Dordrecht 2014.",,,"Argyroudis, S.; Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University, 54124 Thessaloniki, Greece; email: sarg@civil.auth.gr",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",15736059,9789401788342,,,"English","Geotech.

Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a local and painless antimicrobial treatment that can be applied in periodontal treatment without systemic risks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential improvement of aPDT on clinical and metabolic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction with nonsurgical periodontal treatment plus doxycycline. Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes and diagnosis of chronic periodontitis were treated with scaling and root planning (SRP; N=15) or SRP plus phenothiazine chloride photosensitizer-induced aPDT (SRP + aPDT, N=15). Patients of both groups took doxycycline (100 mg/day) for 2 weeks and plaque index, bleeding on probe (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), suppuration, clinical attachment level (CAL), and glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) were measured at baseline and 3 months after therapy. An improvement in clinical parameters such as PPD, CAL, S, and BOP between groups was observed but without statistical significance (p>0.05). Intragroup analysis showed a significant reduction of HbA1c (8.5±0.9 to 7.5±0.1, p<0.01) in the SRP + aPDT group. The differences of HbA1c between baseline and 3 months were greater for the SRP + aPDT (11.4 %) than SRP (10 %) (0.87±0.9 and 0.4±0.84 respectively; p<0.05). A single application of the aPDT as an adjunct to periodontal treatment did not show additional benefits in the clinical parameters but resulted in a slight greater decrease in HbA1c. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Antimicrobial therapy; Clinical trials; Periodontal diseases/therapy; Photodynamic","doxycycline; hemoglobin A1c; immunoglobulin G; phenothiazine; antiinfective agent; doxycycline; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; photosensitizing agent; adult; antibiotic therapy; antimicrobial photodynamic therapy; antimicrobial therapy; article; chronic periodontitis; clinical article; controlled study; drug effect; drug safety; female; human; male; medical record review; mouth hygiene; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; scaling and root planning; treatment duration; treatment planning; blood; chronic periodontitis; metabolism; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; periodontal pocket; photochemotherapy; preventive dentistry; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Chronic Periodontitis; Combined Modality Therapy; Dental Scaling; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Doxycycline; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Periodontal Pocket; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Root Planing; Treatment Outcome","Macedo, G.D.O.; Faculdade de Odontologia, Rua Siriri 263, 49010-450, Aracaju, SE, Brazil; email: gmacedo75@yahoo.com.br",,"Springer-Verlag London Ltd",02688921,,LMSCE,"23474741","English","Lasers Med.

We first extend the framework of the market instability indicator, an early warning signal defined for a single economy as the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix of the wealth dynamical system. Then, we formulate a quantitative definition of instability contagion in terms thereof. Finally, we analyse the mechanism of instability contagion for both single and multiple economies.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper aims to explore how banks have modified their behaviours since the subprime crisis and their influence on credit access for SMEs. Findings: We provide evidence that strategic orientations adopted by banks (both fragile and robust) are quite voluntary and not simply the result of following regulations. Unfortunately, these orientations have hampered SMEs' access to credit. Practical implications: The core result of the paper is to emphasize that banking behaviours have considerably changed just after the subprime crisis and that SMEs have to deal with this new reality. These findings could be of interest for regulators and banking authorities to control liquidity constraints and guarantee both the stability of the global banking system and sustainable economic growth.

We argue that risk is not simply a feature of a financial product but a good in and of itself. Examining financial risk, we argue that it is most accurately typed as a common pool (particularly systemic risk) and so another approach to financial risk pricing is needed. We outline the basics of an ex-ante quasi-insurance fund to price financial risk. For more effective governance, risk-loving agents need to contribute to an ex-ante quasi-insurance fund. Insurance recipients would be risk-averse agents, who do not contribute, as they are forced to participate in systemic risk-taking against their preferences.

We show that, in the past, such decoupling has preceded episodes of systemic financial distress. Our new measure provides a risk-based indicator of credit conditions, and as such, complements earlier quantity-based indicators from the literature.

During the recent (and still ongoing) financial crisis, answers to this question using standard approaches, e.g., regulatory capital ratios, were no longer credible, and thus broad-based supervisory stress testing became the new tool. Bank balance sheets are notoriously opaque and susceptible to asset substitution (easy swapping of high risk for low risk assets), so stress tests, tailored to the situation at hand, can provide clarity by openly disclosing details of the results and approaches taken, allowing trust to be regained. With that trust re-established, the cost-benefit of stress testing disclosures may tip away from bank-specific towards more aggregated information. This paper lays out a framework for the stress testing of banks: why it is useful and why it has become such a popular tool for the regulatory community in the course of the recent financial crisis; how stress testing is done (design and execution); and finally, with stress testing results in hand, how one should handle their disclosure, and whether it should be different in crisis vs. ""normal"" times. © 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.","Capital requirements; Leverage; Systemic risk",,"Schuermann, T.1166 Avenue of the Americas, 29th Floor, New York, NY 10036, United States; email: til.schuermann@oliverwyman.com",,"Elsevier",01692070,,IJFOE,,"English","Int.

The aim of the study was a long-term evaluation of local anatomical, as looking at systemic factors influencing specific complications and the failure rate of such plates. Materials and methods In a retrospective study covering an 11-year period, we reviewed the outcomes of angular stable plates of patients who had a segmental resection of the mandible and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction. Complications and failure rates were assessed and local (anatomical size and localization of resection) as well as systemic risk factors (age, sex, radiation therapy, smoking) evaluated. Results Altogether, 162 plates were reviewed. The overall complication rate was 28% (fractures n = 8, loose screws n = 7, dehiscences n = 31) after an average time of 13 months. Cumulative survival rates of 73% after one, of 67% after 2, of 59% after 3 and of 40% after five years were observed. We found a significant correlation of increasing defect sizes to a rising complication and failure rate. Plate dehiscence occurred more often in defects including the midline (p = 0.005). Though not statistically significant, the occurrence of plate fracture was associated with lateral mandibular defects (7/8, p = 0.113). In smoking patients an earlier failure rate was seen. Conclusion The results clearly indicate that the success of alloplastic reconstruction plates of the mandible is dependent on various risk factors. They should - if possible - be used temporarily only. If not done primarily, a secondary approach with bone reconstruction is recommended. © 2013 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The key feature of this character is the marked ability of French and German banks to resist unsolicited takeover bids, especially - although not exclusively- those from foreign competitors. We present an institutional perspective to account for the restrained character of takeovers in French and German banking. Our perspective is composed of two elements. First, institutional arrangements are important since they structure power relations among firm stakeholders by providing opportunities, as well as imposing constraints, to influence the decision-making process in which takeover transactions take place. Second, institutional arrangements provide firm stakeholders with several potential opportunities, not just one, to block unsolicited bids since takeover contests are composed of sequences of decisions for which approval is needed at each stage. French and German banks have used different mixes of institutional arrangements, themselves located at different stages of takeover transactions, to secure restrained markets for corporate control. Our institutional analysis, in turn, also illustrates an important shortcoming of banking sector protectionism, namely the contribution of protection from unsolicited takeover bids to the building of banks carrying systemic risks. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","banks; complex causation; institutions; state intervention/regulation; takeovers; varieties of capitalism",,,,"Routledge",09692290,,,,"English","Rev.

At the same time, banks' sovereign debt portfolios have featured an increasing home bias. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two facts, and its rationale. First, we inquire to what extent the dynamics of sovereign yield differentials relative to the swap rate and CDS premia reflect changes in perceived sovereign solvency risk or rather different responses to systemic risk due to the possible collapse of the euro. We do so by decomposing yield differentials and CDS spreads in a country-specific and a common risk component via a dynamic factor model. We then investigate how the home bias of banks' sovereign portfolios responds to yield differentials and to their two components, by estimating a vector error-correction model on 2007-13 monthly data. We find that in most countries of the eurozone, and especially in its periphery, banks' sovereign exposures respond positively to increases in yields. When bank exposures are related to the country and common risk components of yields, it turns out that (1) in the periphery, banks increase their domestic exposure in response to increases in country risk, while in core countries they do not; (2) in most eurozone countries banks respond to an increase in the common risk factor by raising their domestic exposures. Finding (1) suggests distorted incentives in periphery banks' response to changes in their own sovereign's risk. Finding (2) indicates that, when systemic risk increases, all banks tend to increase the home bias of their portfolios, making the eurozone sovereign market more segmented. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2014.",,"banking; currency devaluation; debt crisis; error correction; financial market; risk assessment; sovereignty",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02664658,,,,"English","Econ.

Many have proposed the use of historical cost accounting, promoting its ability to avoid the amplification of systemic risk. We caution against focusing on the accounting rule in isolation, and instead emphasize the interaction between accounting and the regulatory framework. First, historical cost accounting, through incentives that arise via interactions with complex capital adequacy regulation, does generate market distortions of its own. Second, while mark-to-market accounting may indeed generate fire sales during a crisis, forward-looking institutions that rationally internalize the probability of fire sales are incentivized to adopt a more prudent investment strategy during normal times which leads to a safer portfolio entering the crisis. Using detailed, position- and transaction-level data from the US insurance industry, we show that (a) market prices do serve as 'early warning signals', (b) insurers that employed historical cost accounting engaged in greater degrees of regulatory arbitrage before the crisis and limited loss recognition during the crisis, and (c) insurers facing mark-to-market accounting tend to be more prudent in their portfolio allocations. Our identification relies on the sharp difference in statutory accounting rules between life and P&C companies as well as the heterogeneity in implementation of these rules within each insurance type across US states. Our results indicate that regulatory simplicity may be preferred to the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios that gives rise, through interactions with accounting rules, to distorted risk-taking incentives and potential build-up of systemic risk. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2014.",,"capital market; cost analysis; industrial investment; insurance industry; market conditions; regulatory framework; United States",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",02664658,,,,"English","Econ.

Some of the most urgent challenges facing those responsible for improving and regulating patient safety are therefore how to identify, interpret, integrate and act on the early warnings and weak signals of emerging risks - before those risks contribute to a disastrous failure of care. These challenges are fundamentally organisational and cultural: they relate to what information is routinely noticed, communicated and attended to within and between healthcare organisations - and, most critically, what is assumed and ignored. Analysing these organisational and cultural challenges suggests three practical ways that healthcare organisations and their regulators can improve safety and address emerging risks. First, engage in practices that actively produce and amplify fleeting signs of ignorance. Second, work to continually define and update a set of specific fears of failure. And third, routinely uncover and publicly circulate knowledge on the sources of systemic risks to patient safety and the improvements required to address them.",,"disaster medicine; disaster planning; health care organization; health care quality; human; knowledge; learning; patient safety; review","Macrae, C.; Centre for Patient Safety and Service Quality, Imperial College London, Medical School Building, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom; email: carlmacrae@mac.com",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20445415,,,"24599729","English","BMJ Qual.

According to this ""global"" view reserve accumulation might destabilize the international financial system. Since the crisis affects all countries alike, the accumulation of reserves imposes a negative externality on non-accumulating countries. We integrate this idea in a theoretical model of the optimal amount of reserves and illustrate the gap between local and global optimality: the consideration of systemic risk lowers the demand for reserves. Moreover, if a supranational authority determines the optimal level of reserves, it internalizes the negative externality and accumulates fewer reserves. A macroprudential tax on reserve hoardings might implement the socially optimal solution. Our calibration analysis shows that these considerations are economically significant: they lower the optimal amount of reserves in the benchmark case by 45%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Financial crises; Global imbalances; International reserves; Macro-prudential policies; Systemic risk",,"Steiner, A.; University of Osnabrueck, Institute of Empirical Economic Research, Rolandstrasse 8, D-49069 Osnabrueck, Germany; email: asteiner@uni-osnabrueck.de",,"Elsevier",00142921,,,,"English","Eur.

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of these polymorphisms among RVO Tunisian patients with and without systemic risk factors. Seventy-two patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) were studied. The control group included140 people matched for age, sex, and risk factors. Participants in the study were genotyped for the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. The genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of the three genotypes (AA, AC, CC) of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism between RVO patients and healthy controls. However, the prevalence of the group of mutated genotypes (AC+CC) of the missense variant MTHFR A1298C was significantly different between patients and controls (16.67% vs. 6.42%, p=01). Additionally, the frequency of the CT genotype as well as the group of combined mutated genotypes (CT+TT) for the C677T variant was significantly higher among RVO patients compared with controls (p&lt;10-3, p&lt;10-3). This suggests an association between this polymorphism and RVO.

We present the case of an IgA-deficient patient whose candidacy for double-lung transplantation was under review in the preoperative period. Clinical features: A 49-yr-old patient with end-stage chronic obstructive lung disease secondary to deficiencies in IgA and IgG subclasses was being assessed for double-lung transplantation. Early recognition of the ramifications of perioperative transfusion prompted consultation with the transfusion medicine service. This in turn facilitated specialized laboratory testing and the coordinated provision of appropriate blood products for the unpredictable date of transplantation. The theoretical systemic risks of a non-IgA-deficient graft on the sensitized IgA-deficient host were considered. To affirm the patient's candidacy for transplantation, he was ultimately challenged preoperatively with IgA-containing products in a controlled intensive-care setting. Conclusion: Through a multidisciplinary, a successful transplantation outcome was achieved in an IgA-deficient patient undergoing major surgery.

Conditional on the US capital markets being in financial distress, idiosyncratic shocks to the top 10% largest funds investing in the US explain about 40% of the risk fluctuations in other non-US markets. The findings are also economically and statistically significant for the top largest funds investing in non-US markets, with the effects becoming especially large during the global financial crisis of 2007-09.

DESIGN:: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS:: Five patients (five eyes) with triple infection keratitis were identified. METHODS:: Eyes with polymicrobial keratitis were identified from January 2002 to December 2010. Only culture-positive cases and eyes infected by three different organisms were included. Demographics, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: The size of the corneal infiltrate, presence of hypopyon, pre- and post-treatment best-corrected visual acuity, antibiotic regimen and sensitivity, types of isolated pathogens, duration of infection, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS:: The mean age was 39 years (SD, ±23.4; range, 21-74). Use of topical steroids was the commonest risk factor (80%). Multiple risk factors were identified in four eyes. The average size of corneal infiltrate was 23.5 mm (SD, ±35.2; range, 2.08-85.5), and all eyes developed hypopyon. A total of 15 organisms belonging to 10 species (bacteria=7, fungi=3) were isolated. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were the most frequently isolated bacteria (n=3) and fungi (n=3), respectively. All patients had at least one type of fungal isolate. Infection resolved with medical treatment in four eyes and one eye had to be eviscerated as the patient developed panophthalmitis. The average time taken for infection to resolve was 30 days (SD, ±19.3; range, 13-61). CONCLUSIONS:: A high index of suspicion of polymicrobial keratitis should be made in patients with multiple and systemic risk factors. Use of topical steroid was the most common risk factor. Prolonged course of disease, relatively large infiltrate, and presence of hypopyon and fungal isolates are typical features of triple infection keratitis. © 2014 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.","Keratitis; Polymicrobial; Triple infection","amphotericin B; cefazolin; ciprofloxacin; gentamicin; natamycin; piperacillin; steroid; antiinfective agent; steroid; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; article; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; Candida albicans; candidiasis; clinical article; contact lens; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; drug sensitivity; eye surgery; female; fungus isolation; human; hypopyon; injury; keratitis; keratomycosis; male; panophthalmitis; priority journal; Pseudomonas infection; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; triple infection keratitis; visual acuity; Bacteria; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; fungus; isolation and purification; keratitis; microbiology; middle aged; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; Female; Fungi; Humans; Keratitis; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Steroids; Young Adult","Ray, M.; Department of Ophthalmology, National University Health System, National University Hospital, 1E, Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228, Singapore; email: mantoshr@yahoo.com",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",15422321,,,"24681610","English","Eye Contact Lens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899899681

The molecular mechanisms that link disturbed flow-generated mechanical forces with arterial injury are uncertain. To illuminate them, we investigated the effects of flow on endothelial cell (EC) senescence. Approach and Results - LDLR-/- (low-density lipoprotein receptor -/-) mice were exposed to a high-fat diet for 2 to 12 weeks (or to a normal chow diet as a control) before the assessment of cellular senescence in aortic ECs. En face staining revealed that senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and p53 expression were elevated in ECs at sites of disturbed flow in response to a high-fat diet. By contrast, ECs exposed to undisturbed flow did not express senescence-associated β-galactosidase or p53. Studies of aortae from healthy pigs (aged 6 months) also revealed enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining at sites of disturbed flow. These data suggest that senescent ECs accumulate at disturbed flow sites during atherogenesis. We used in vitro flow systems to examine whether a causal relationship exists between flow and EC senescence. Exposure of cultured ECs to flow (using either an orbital shaker or a syringe-pump flow bioreactor) revealed that disturbed flow promoted EC senescence compared with static conditions, whereas undisturbed flow reduced senescence. Gene silencing studies demonstrated that disturbed flow induced EC senescence via a p53-p21 signaling pathway. Disturbed flow-induced senescent ECs exhibited reduced migration compared with nonsenescent ECs in a scratch wound closure assay, and thus may be defective for arterial repair. However, pharmacological activation of sirtuin 1 (using resveratrol or SRT1720) protected ECs from disturbed flow-induced senescence. Conclusions - Disturbed flow promotes endothelial senescence via a p53-p21-dependent pathway which can be inhibited by activation of sirtuin 1. These observations support the principle that pharmacological activation of sirtuin 1 may promote cardiovascular health by suppressing EC senescence at atheroprone sites. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","aging; endothelium; sirtuin 1","beta galactosidase; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; low density lipoprotein receptor; protein p21; protein p53; resveratrol; sirtuin 1; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; animal cell; animal experiment; article; atherogenesis; blood flow; cell aging; cell proliferation; controlled study; endothelium cell; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; gene silencing; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid diet; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; shear stress; signal transduction; single cell analysis; wound closure; aging; endothelium; sirtuin 1; Animals; Aortic Diseases; Atherosclerosis; Bioreactors; Cell Aging; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Endothelial Cells; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Activators; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Mechanotransduction, Cellular; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Receptors, LDL; Regional Blood Flow; RNA Interference; Sirtuin 1; Stress, Mechanical; Swine; Time Factors; Transfection; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; Wound Healing","Evans, P.C.; Department of Cardiovascular Science, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Beech Hill Rd, Sheffield S10 2RX, United Kingdom; email: paul.evans@sheffield.ac.uk",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",10795642,,ATVBF,"24651677","English","Arterioscler.

Since 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has tagged global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and has imposed a higher regulatory capital of loss absorbency (HLA) requirement. However, the identification of G-SIBs may overlook banks with major domestic systemic importance, i.e. the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). This paper describes how to adjust market-based systemic risk measures to identify D-SIBs. In an empirical analysis within the eurozone, I show that (i) the SRISK methodology produces similar rankings whatever the system used. However, (ii) the SRISK values greatly vary across systems, which calls for imposing the higher of either D-SIB or G-SIB HLA requirements. Finally, (iii) the δCoVaR methodology is extremely sensitive to the choice of the system. © 2013 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy.","D-SIBs; Financial regulation; G-SIBs; SRISK; Systemic risk",,"Benoit, S.; Univ.

Our analysis presents not only current levels of domestic systemic importance of individual banks but also the changes. We also consider the systemic risk of the whole banking system, by investigating how D-SIBs and non-D-SIBs are correlated before and after the recent financial crises using Copula. We find that the systemic importance of major banks is decreasing, while some banks becoming more systemically important should require tight regulations. D-SIBs as a whole subsystem display stronger correlation with non-D-SIBs than the individual D-SIBs, which alerts the regulatory to pay attention to ""too-many-to-fail"" problems. Contagion effects between D-SIBs and non-D-SIBs exist during the subprime crisis, but did not exist during the European debt crisis.

Design Cohort of a randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial. Methods Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with at least 16 months of follow-up were included. Exclusion criteria included untreated intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 21 mm Hg, visual field mean deviation worse than -16 dB, or contraindications to study medications. Patients were randomized to topical treatment with timolol 0.5% or brimonidine 0.2%. Stereophotographs were reviewed independently by 2 masked graders searching for disc hemorrhages. The main outcomes investigated were the detection of disc hemorrhage at any time during follow-up and their recurrence. Ocular and systemic risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model and were tested further for independence in a multivariate model. Results Two hundred fifty-three eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7 ± 10.9 years; women, 58%; European ancestry, 71%) followed up for an average ± standard deviation of 40.6 ± 12 months were included. In the multivariate analysis, history of migraine (hazard ratio [HR], 5.737; P =.012), narrower neuroretinal rim width at baseline (HR, 2.91; P =.048), use of systemic β-blockers (HR, 5.585; P =.036), low mean systolic blood pressure (HR, 1.06; P =.02), and low mean arterial ocular perfusion pressure during follow-up (HR, 1.172; P =.007) were significant and independent risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection. Treatment randomization was not associated with either the occurrence or recurrence of disc hemorrhages. Conclusions In this cohort of Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients, migraine, baseline narrower neuroretinal rim width, low systolic blood pressure and mean arterial ocular perfusion pressure, and use of systemic β-blockers were risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection.

But research also indicates that fund management in certain circumstances may contribute to the buildup of systemic risk and severity of financial crises. The global financial crisis provided a number of new experiences on the contribution of fund managers to systemic risk. In this article, we focus on these lessons from the crisis. We distinguish between three sources of systemic risk in the financial system that may arise from fund management: insufficient credit risk transfer to fund managers; runs on funds that cause sudden reductions in funding to banks and other financial entities; and contagion through business ties between fund managers and their sponsors. Our discussion relates to the current intense debate on the role the so-called shadow banking system played in the global financial crisis. Several regulatory initiatives have been launched or suggested to reduce the systemic risk arising from non-bank financial entities, and we briefly discuss the likely impact of these on the sources of systemic risk outlined in the article. © 2014 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Credit risk transfer; Financial crisis; Fund management; Liquidity risk; Shadow banking; Systemic risk",,"Bengtsson, E.; Financial Stability Department of Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm UniversitySweden; email: bengtsson.elias@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",09638008,,,,"English","Financ.

Yet our system of law is not unlike other complex social, biological, and physical systems in exhibiting local fragility in the midst of its global robustness. Understanding how this ""robust yet fragile"" (RYF) dilemma operates in legal systems is important to the extent law is expected to assist in managing systemic risk - the risk of large local or even system-wide failures - in other social systems. Indeed, legal system failures have been blamed as partly responsible for disasters such as the recent financial system crisis and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. If we cannot effectively manage systemic risk within the legal system, how can we expect the legal system to manage systemic risk elsewhere? This Article employs a complexity science model of the RYF dilemma to explore why systemic risk persists in legal systems and how to manage it. Part I defines complexity in the context of the institutions and instruments that make up the legal system. Part II defines the five dimensions of robustness that support functionality of the legal system: (I) reliability, (2) efficiency, (3) scalability, (4) modularity, and (5) evolvability. Part III then defines system fragility by examining the internal and external constraints that impede legal system robustness and the fail-safe system control strategies for managing their effects. With those basic elements of the RYF dilemma model in place, Part IV defines systemic risk and explores the paradoxical role of increasingly organized complexity brought about by fail-safe strategies as a source of legal system failure. There is no way around the RYF dilemma - some degree of systemic risk is inherent in any complex adaptive system - but the balance between robustness and fragility is something we can hope to influence. To explore how, Part V applies the RYF dilemma model to a concrete systemic risk management context - oil drilling in the deep Gulf of Mexico. The legal regime governing offshore oil exploration and extraction has been blamed as contributing to the set of failures that led to the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon spill and is at the center of reform initiatives. Using this case study, I argue that the RYF dilemma model provides valuable insights into how legal systems fail and how to manage legal systemic risk.",,,"Ruhl, J.B.; Vanderbilt University, United States; email: jb.ruhl@vanderbilt.edu",,"The Trustees of Indiana University",00196665,,,,"English","Indiana Law J.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897807623

Here we show how random graph models of connectivity between networks can provide insights into shifts in percolation properties and into systemic risk. Tradeoffs abound in many of our results. For instance, edges between networks confer global connectivity using relatively few edges, and that connectivity can be beneficial in situations like communication or supplying resources, but it can prove dangerous if epidemics were to spread on the network. For a specific model of cascades of load in the system (namely, the sandpile model), we find that each network minimizes its risk of undergoing a large cascade if it has an intermediate amount of connectivity to other networks. Thus, connections among networks confer benefits and costs that balance at optimal amounts. However, what is optimal for minimizing cascade risk in one network is suboptimal for minimizing risk in the collection of networks. This work provides tools for modeling interconnected networks (or single networks with mesoscopic structure), and it provides hypotheses on tradeoffs in interdependence and their implications for systemic risk. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,"D'Souza, R.M.; University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States; email: raissa@cse.ucdavis.edu",,"Springer Verlag",18600832,9783319035178,,,"English","Underst.

Vascular leakage, angiogenesis and neuronal degeneration are key features of DR. Current effective interventions for DR include treatment of systemic risk factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ocular treatments include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibitors, laser photocoagulation and surgery. While anti-VEGF therapy has become as first-line treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) that causes reduced vision, intravitreal glucocorticoids also have been shown to be efficacious in this situation. It has been reported that all the major pathological processes of DR are susceptible to glucocorticoid treatment. The effects of glucocorticoids on vascular leakage and angiogenesis may be mediated through their well established anti-inflammatory role. Alternatively, glucocorticoids may affect other mechanisms known to be activated in DR. Potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids include blockage of cytokine production and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion induced by VEGF-A. Glucocorticoids decrease the expression of VEGF-A directly, and increase the production, or decrease phosphorylation, of tight junction-associated proteins. Glucocorticoids have also been shown to be neuroprotective, in contrast to VEGF-A inhibitors which animal studies suggest may be neurotoxic. This review outlines the biological properties of synthetic glucocorticoids, with particular emphasis on the potential beneficial effect of combining glucocorticoids with anti-VEGF treatment for DME and DR. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.","Diabetic retinopathy; Glucocorticoid receptors; Glucocorticoids; Neuronal protection","betamethasone; chemokine receptor; dexamethasone; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; fk 506 binding protein; fluocinolone acetonide; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein 90; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 1; interleukin 12; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; interleukin 9; lymphotoxin; methylprednisolone; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; occludin; placebo; prednisone; tight junction protein; transcription factor AP 1; triamcinolone acetonide; tumor necrosis factor; unindexed drug; vasculotropin inhibitor; glucocorticoid; angiogenesis; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; blood retina barrier; cataract; central retina artery occlusion; connective tissue disease; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; drug bioavailability; drug mechanism; drug structure; electric resistance; endophthalmitis; genetic transcription; human; hypopyon; intraocular pressure abnormality; Kirisawa uveitis; laser coagulation; leukocyte adherence; ligand binding; myopia; nerve cell degeneration; neuroprotection; nonhuman; open angle glaucoma; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); protein expression; protein phosphorylation; randomized controlled trial (topic); retina detachment; retina exudate; review; signal transduction; transactivation; vitreous hemorrhage; animal; chemistry; diabetic retinopathy; macular edema; metabolism; Animals; Diabetic Retinopathy; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Macular Edema","Zhang, X.; Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Tongren Eye Centre, Tongren Hospital, Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Key Lab, Capital Medical University, 100730, China; email: mmzxy2010@163.com",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",15665240,,CMMUB,"24467200","English","Curr.

This is required because the banking sector has been transformed significantly by the changing environment over the past two decades. The 2007-2009 financial crisis also added to concerns about existing bank business models. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative data collected from interviews with bank managers and analysts in the UK, this paper develops a grounded theory of bank intangibles. Findings: The model reveals how intangibles and tangible/financial resources interact in the bank value creation process, how they actively respond to environmental changes, how bank intangibles are understood by external observers such as analysts, and how bankers and analysts differ in their views. Research limitations/implications: Grounded theory provides the means to further develop bank models as business models and theoretical models. This provides the means to think beyond conventional finance constructs and to relate bank models to a wider theoretical literature concerning intellectual capital, organisational and social systems theory, and ""performativity"". Practical implications: Such development of bank models and of a systems perspective is critical to the understanding of banks by bankers, by observers and for their ""critical and reflexive performativity"". It also has implications for systemic risk and bank regulation. Originality/value: The paper reveals the core role of intellectual capital (IC) in banks, in markets, and in developing theory and research at firm and system levels. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bank models; Banks; External observers; Intermediation; Knowledge; Systems; United Kingdom",,"Holland, J.; Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; email: john.holland@glasgow.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09513574,,,,"English","Account.

The correlation between different crop yields due to rotations or systemic risks requires estimation of joint yield distribution for multiple crops. In this article, we apply a nonparametric method to estimate bivariate yield distributions using farm-level yield data of wheat and corn in Shandong Province in China. Then, the simulated yields are used to evaluate the expected indemnity of one traditional and one hypothetical crop insurance programme. Our results reveal that the nonparametric bivariate method is very flexible in shaping the yield probability density functions to estimate local idiosyncrasies and correlation between two crops. It is also feasible to simulate the nonparametric yield distributions at a satisfying level of accuracy. The simulation results show that the hypothetical two-crop insurance contract can be more affordable to farmers than traditional individual crop insurance contracts. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","bivariate; crop insurance; nonparametric; yield distribution","agricultural economics; crop yield; estimation method; insurance system; maize; modeling; probability density function; wheat; China; Shandong; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","Wang, H.

This research focused on finding a link during the crisis time-period and often states that ""accounting is only a messenger"". The model presented in this paper emphasises finding the link before the crisis and ""accounting as money."" Use is made of an accounting model of the economy due to the inability of standard models of monetary transmission to incorporate global financial crisis characteristics such as feedback effects, systemic risk and the centrality of the financial sector in the crisis. The model shows FVA in banks to be an accelerator that amplifies the financial cycle upswing. Feedback effects noted in the model include changes in the demand for financial instruments and changes in demand in the real economy. Minsky-like, crisis is shown to be endogenous to the model, working through the fragility of balance sheets in the real sector as well as in the financial sector. Bank balance sheet fragility is caused by bad capital driving out good capital, banks reaching for yield and the inversion of the yield curve. The model shows that the practice of not meeting rising credit demand with increasing credit supply is an essential control mechanism in the financial cycle. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,,"De Jager, P.; Department of Finance and Tax, South Africa; email: phillip.dejager@uct.ac.za",,"Elsevier Ltd",03613682,,,,"English","Account.

We find that greater competition encourages banks to take on more diversified risks, making the banking system less fragile to shocks. Examining the impact of the institutional and regulatory environment on bank systemic risk shows that banking systems are more fragile in countries with weak supervision and private monitoring, greater government ownership of banks, and with public policies that restrict competition. We also find that the negative effect of lack of competition can be mitigated by a strong institutional environment that allows for efficient public and private monitoring of financial institutions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Bank competition; Bank concentration; Credit risk; Default risk; Distance to default; Lerner index; Merton model; Systemic risk",,"Anginer, D.; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State UniversityUnited States; email: danginer@vt.edu",,,10429573,,,,"English","J.

Glycoxidation plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis, as pentosidine and Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), were detected in AD hallmarks, and in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the definitive role of AGEs in the neuropathology of AD is inconclusive. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the level of pentosidine in CSF of patients affected by neurological disorders, including probable AD, in order to assess the feasibility of AGEs detection in CSF and to explore pentosidine as a potential biomarker in AD. Methods: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with AD (NINCDS ADRDA criteria) and different neurological disorders were enrolled. Diabetic patients were excluded. Pentosidine, CML, amyloid β1-42 were assessed by high vperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Odetti modified method,and by sandwich ELISA respectively. Results: Our data showed the presence of pentosidine in all CSF samples, a significant increase in CSF pentosidine levels with age (p<0.05) and a significant decreased concentration of pentosidine in four AD subjects (p<0.01), after normalization to CSF protein concentration. Conclusions: The study showed that AGEs concentration in CSF might benefit from age correction, at least for pentosidine, originally addressing a potential systemic age-dependent AGEs accumulation. The significant decrease of CSF pentosidine in AD, even in 4 patients, might conceive that different AGEs inform specific types of neurodegeneration, depending on oxidative stress levels, blood-brain barrier permeability, brain localization and systemic risk factors. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.","Alzheimer dementia; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); diagnosis; pentosidine","amyloid beta protein[1-42]; pentosidine; tau protein; adult; age; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; blood brain barrier; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; diagnostic value; female; human; human tissue; male; middle aged; neurofibrillary tangle; neurotoxicity; nitration; oligomerization; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; protein degradation; protein glycosylation; urinary excretion; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Arginine; Biological Markers; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Lysine; Male; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments","Monacelli, F.; Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties (DIMI), Viale Benedetto XV, 6, 16132 Genoa, Italy; email: Fiammetta.Monacelli@unige.it",,,14346621,,CCLMF,"23612599","English","Clin.

Because these financial intermediaries perform maturity transformation, they are subject to potential runs. We derive distinct liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation constraints, which determine whether a run can occur as a result of changing market expectations. We show that the extent to which borrowers can ward off an individual run depends on whether it has sufficient liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation capacity. These determinants depend on the borrower's (endogenous) balance sheet and on (exogenous) fundamentals. Systemic runs are possible if shocks to the valuation of collateral held by outside investors are sufficiently strong and uniform, and if the system as a whole is exposed to high short-term funding risk.

In comparison to other developed countries (e.g. Ireland, Spain, Greece, USA, Denmark, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia or Bulgaria) was the decrease in residential property prices only gradual and the default rate is lagging behind the average of the developed countries. The volatility in residential property prices could follow the accumulation of systemic risks of owner-occupied housing, especially the growing share of low-income households with mortgage debts among home-owners. The article therefore aims to answer following research questions. First, was there significant increase in the share of low-income households repaying their mortgages in the owner-occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005? Second, was there significant increase in 'innovative' mortgage products (e.g. interest-only mortgages, mortgages denominated in foreign currencies etc.) on the Czech mortgage market after 2005? Supplementary question was, whether balanced housing market, i.e. housing market with significant share of rental housing, could be one of the reasons of lower volatility in residential property prices, in comparison to housing market oriented mainly toward owner-occupied housing. The analysis showed that the hypothesis about sharply growing share of low-income households repaying mortgages in the owner-occupied housing sector in the Czech Republic after 2005 can be rejected. Also the share of 'innovative' mortgage products in the portfolios of Czech mortgage lenders seems to be rather negligible. Therefore we concluded that there is no evidence about significant accumulation of systemic risks on the Czech housing market. Moreover, the comparison of impacts of economic crisis in selected countries showed that balanced housing market could pose the best protection against negative impacts of economics crisis and against increased volatility in residential property prices.","Czech republic; Owner-occupied housing; Systemic risks",,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i.

It discusses formation, structure and causes of mass local debt obligations in China rapidly piled up in past few years. Based on the data compiled, it estimates that debt of local governments amounted to 19.41 trillion yuan by the end of 2012. Against this backdrop, total assets of Chinese local governments which can be used to service debt obligations are totalled to 76.54 trillion yuan. While a full-fledged financial crisis resulting from over-indebtedness of local governments is unlikely to emerge in an immediate future, insolvent problem of many local governments is pending, which may endanger stability of the banking system. The unchecked expansion of local government debt is attributed to both dramatic change in external environments and structural flaws of public governance in China’s administrative system. To contain this severe systemic risk, private fund is a main source mobilized to alleviate financial distress faced by local governments, but public governance reform, fiscal accountability, rule of laws and appropriate financial instruments consist of necessary conditions to solve the possible default problem. © 2022 De Gruyter.

Post-GFC, the trend of SMS is characterized by a move away from the market-based approach and an increasing reliance on the risk-based approach. Further, the macro-prudential supervision approach relying on the involvement of the securities regulator has become common practice. First, this paper identifies the theoretical framework of the SMS prior to the GFC. Next, this paper observes some key developments of SMS post-GFC. Finally, this paper concludes that the philosophy of the SMS has experienced substantial evolution post-GFC. Neo-liberal ideologies and the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) is no longer considered as the conventional wisdom of securities market regulators. Accordingly, a new conceptual framework of market supervision is recommended. The twin-peak model is identified as the preferred model due to a wider view of systemic risk mitigation. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

We investigate a one-period borrower-lender network with no dynamics, in which all debts are due at the same time and have the same seniority. Every node in the network represents a financial institution, and every node is labeled with a nonnegative real number which is the cash on hand that the institution has before the debts are due. If node i owes d dollars to node j, this is represented in the network as a directed edge from node i to node j with weight d. We propose a duality-based distributed algorithm to determine the optimal cash injection amount C and its corresponding optimal allocation among the nodes, to minimize the cost function C+λD which is a linear combination of two terms: the total cash injected into the system and the total unpaid liabilities D in the system after the cash injection. The user-selected coefficient λ controls the relative importance of the two terms in the cost function. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Directed edges; Financial institution; Financial system; Linear combinations; Nonnegative real number; Optimal allocation; Systemic risks; Algorithms; Data processing; Finance; Optimization; Cost functions","Purdue University, West Lafayettem, IN, 47906, United States",,,,9781479902484,,,"English","IEEE Global Conf.

A consensus emerged that these risky financial instruments should move through safe, strong clearinghouses, which would be bulwarks against systemic risk, and that the destructive impact of the failures during the crisis of AIG, Lehman Brothers, and the Reserve Primary Fund could have been softened or eliminated had strong clearinghouses been in place. Via the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, Congress instructed regulators to construct clearinghouses through which these risky financial instruments would trade and settle. Clearinghouses could cut financial risk, reduce contagion, and halt a local financial problem before it becomes an economy-wide crisis. But clearinghouses are weaker bulwarks against financial contagion, financial panic, and systemic risk than is commonly thought. They may well be unable to defend the economy against financial stress such as that of the 2008-2009 crisis. Although they are efficient financial platforms in ordinary times, they do little to reduce systemic risk in crisis times. They generally do not reduce the core risk targetedthat the failure of a financial firm will cause other firms to failbut rather transfer that risk of loss to others. The major reduction in risk among the inside-the-clearinghouse traders is largely achieved by pushing that risk elsewhere, often to a systemically dangerous spot. Financial contagion can thus side-step the clearinghouse fortress and bring down other core financial institutions. Worse, clearinghouses could not have readily handled the major stresses that afflicted the economy in 2008-2009, could well have transmitted and magnified them, and can only weakly affect the type of financial stress that Congress targeted with Dodd-Frank. When we add in the other weaknesses of the new clearinghousesas too-big-to-fail institutions, as institutions whose members' incentives to contain clearinghouse riskiness are weaker than the public's, and as institutions that will not be easy to regulateeven the direction of clearinghouses' impact on systemic risk is uncertain. The stakes are high in correctly assessing the value of clearinghouses in containing systemic risk. Much like an overconfidence inspired by powerful military fortresses that an invading enemy can side-step, the reigning overconfidence in clearinghouses lulls regulators to be satisfied that they have done much to arrest problems of contagion and systemic risk by building up clearinghouses, when they have not. © Copyright 2013 Mark J.

We construct a banking system that is composed of a number of banks, which are connected by interbank linkages. By examining the key structure parameters of the banking network, including degree (the number of connections of a bank) and link weight (the amount of interbank assets), we analyze the effect of these parameters on the stability of the banking system. We show that interbank linkages have two opposing effects. They can act as ""liquidity transmitters"" to transfer liquidity from solvent banks to insolvent banks through interbank connections. However, interbank linkages can also act as ""risk transmitters""; if one bank declares bankruptcy, then the loss can be transmitted to its connected banks. We investigate two environments that are differentiated by whether there is an aggregate shortage of liquidity.

The relationship between securitization activity and tail risks is especially relevant in light of the consequences for financial stability, both for the individual securitizing banks and for the market as a whole, as the financial crisis 2007-2008 reveals. By using a sample of Italian listed banks over the period 2000-2009, we find that securitizing banks have, on average, higher expected losses in case of extreme events. This adds new evidence on the main findings in the literature that focused on the evidence that risk transfer through securitization is relatively insignificant compared to the risk retained by the originating bank. We show that this risk retention is in terms of an increase of tail risk. We also find that securitization increases the probability of banks to become ""systemically"" riskier, but we find no difference when comparing the pre-crisis with the post-crisis period. This suggests that the systemic exposures of Italian banks are still as high as before the crisis with severe implications for financial stability. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Expected shortfall; Marginal expected shortfall; Securitization; Systemic risk",,"Battaglia, F.; Dipartimento di Studi Aziendali, Via Medina 40, 80133 Napoli, Italy; email: francesca.battaglia@uniparthenope.it",,,10575219,,,,"English","Int.

We document that bank lending to NBFCs (i) forms a significant proportion of the NBFC liabilities; (ii) fluctuates in line with bank allocation to priority lending sectors; (iii) decreases as the banks expand in the rural areas relative to urban areas; but, (iv) is virtually non-existent for the largest state-owned bank, namely State Bank of India (SBI) and its affiliates which have significant rural branch network. Starting with the financial crisis of Fall 2008, bank lending to NBFCs experienced a permanent contraction shock related to the shift of term deposits toward SBI away from other banks. These bank-NBFC linkages are present primarily for, and affect the credit growth of, those NBFCs that do loans or asset financing but not the investment companies. Overall, the findings suggest that in contrast to the prevailing views of shadow banking in the Western economies, lending to NBFCs in India is viewed by banks as a substitute for direct lending in the non-urban areas of the Indian economy, but this substitution is constrained by distortions in bank deposit flows due to the perceived differential government support of different banking groups. © 2013.","Crisis; Government guarantees; Non-Bank financial corporations; Shadow banking; Systemic risk",,"Sabri Öncü, T.; Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning, India; email: sabrioncu.cafral@rbi.org.in",,,02615606,,,,"English","J.

Indeed, due to the special structure of the balance sheet of a bank and to the interconnections with other institutions of the financial system, the standard pricing formulas do not apply and their use can imply severe mispricing. The pricing of credit derivatives written on a single bank name requires a joint analysis of the risks of all banks directly or indirectly interconnected with the bank of interest. Each name cannot be priced in isolation, but the banking system must be treated as a whole. It is necessary to analyze the contagion of losses among banks, especially the equilibrium of joint defaults and recovery rates at liquidation time. We show the existence and uniqueness of such an equilibrium.

We introduce a Kalman filter procedure to study such elasticity-based measures of broad leverage. This approach enables the detection of the build-up of financial imbalances-as measured by the increase in bank risk-years before what the traditional assets to equity ratio predicts.

The concept of systemic externality purports to provide a solid ground for some sort of economic dirigisme. Systemic externalities express the idea that individual behavior often entails a chain reaction or amplification effects that impact, positively or negatively, the whole market. In relation to financial markets, the market-failure argument centers on the notion of systemic risk, a reflection of negative systemic externalities, which can be explained as follows. When deciding how much to borrow, private agents take into account only some of the benefits and costs of their financing and investment decisions, and they consider aggregate prices as given. Theorists of systemic externalities claim that aggregate risk cannot be conceived as the sum of individual risk.

The purpose of this natural history study was to investigate the combined in-vivo effect of varying levels of systemic hypercholesterolemia and local endothelial shear stress (ESS) on subsequent plaque progression and histological composition. Methods Diabetic, hyperlipidemic swine with higher systemic total cholesterol (TC) (n = 4) and relatively lower TC levels (n = 5) underwent three-vessel intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at 3-5 consecutive time-points in-vivo. ESS was calculated serially using computational fluid dynamics. 3-D reconstructed coronary arteries were divided into 3 mm-long segments (n = 595), which were stratified according to higher vs. relatively lower TC and low (< 1.2 Pa) vs. higher local ESS (≥ 1.2 Pa). Arteries were harvested at 9 months, and a subset of segments (n = 114) underwent histopathologic analyses. Results Change of plaque volume (ΔPV) by IVUS over time was most pronounced in low-ESS segments from higher-TC animals. Notably, higher-ESS segments from higher-TC animals had greater ΔPV compared to low-ESS segments from lower-TC animals (p < 0.001). The time-averaged ESS in segments that resulted in significant plaque increased with increasing TC levels (slope: 0.24 Pa/100 mg/dl; r = 0.80; p < 0.01). At follow-up, low-ESS segments from higher-TC animals had the highest mRNA levels of lipoprotein receptors and inflammatory mediators and, consequently, the greatest lipid accumulation and inflammation. Conclusions This study redefines the principle concept that ""low"" ESS promotes coronary plaque growth and vulnerability by demonstrating that: (i.) the pro-atherogenic threshold of low ESS is not uniform, but cholesterol-dependent; and (ii.) the atherogenic effects of local low ESS are amplified, and the athero-protective effects of higher ESS may be outweighed, by increasing cholesterol levels. Intense hypercholesterolemia and very low ESS are synergistic in favoring rapid atheroma progression and high-risk composition. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Coronary atherosclerosis; Endothelial shear stress; Histology; Hypercholesterolemia; Intravascular ultrasound","1 alkyl 2 acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase; cholesterol; glucose; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP); high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein receptor; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1; vascular cell adhesion molecule 1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arteriography; article; atherosclerotic plaque; cardiovascular parameters; cell infiltration; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease course; gene expression; glucose blood level; histology; hypercholesterolemia; inflammatory cell; intravascular ultrasound; lipid storage; male; nonhuman; plaque volume; priority journal; shear stress; swine; Coronary atherosclerosis; Endothelial shear stress; Histology; Hypercholesterolemia; Intravascular ultrasound; Animals; Cohort Studies; Coronary Artery Disease; Disease Progression; Endothelium, Vascular; Hypercholesterolemia; Male; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Shear Strength; Swine","Stone, P.H.; Cardiovascular Division, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA 02115, United States; email: pstone@partners.org",,,01675273,,IJCDD,"24148915","English","Int.

However, the interplay between financial distress and topological changes is still poorly understood. Here we analyze the quarterly interbank exposures among Dutch banks over the period 1998-2008, ending with the crisis. After controlling for the link density, many topological properties display an abrupt change in 2008, providing a clear - but unpredictable - signature of the crisis. By contrast, if the heterogeneity of banks' connectivity is controlled for, the same properties show a gradual transition to the crisis, starting in 2005 and preceded by an even earlier period during which anomalous debt loops could have led to the underestimation of counter-party risk. These early-warning signals are undetectable if the network is reconstructed from partial bank-specific data, as routinely done.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of such communities from both the system-level and the user-level perspectives. We show that both credit-based and sharing ratio enforcement policies can lead to system-wide 'crunches' or 'crashes,' where the system seizes completely due to too little or too much credit, respectively. We present a theoretical model that identifies the conditions that lead to these system pathologies and we design an adaptive credit system that automatically adjusts credit policies to maintain sustainability. Given private communities that are sustainable, it has been demonstrated that they are greatly oversupplied in terms of excessively high seeder-to-leecher ratios. We further analyze the user-level performance by studying the effects of oversupply. We show that although achieving an increase in the average downloading speed, the phenomenon of oversupply has three undesired effects: long seeding times, low upload capacity utilizations, and an unfair playing field for late entrants into swarms. To alleviate these problems, we propose four different strategies, which have been inspired by ideas in social sciences and economics. We evaluate these strategies through simulations and demonstrate their positive effects. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Credit policy; Demand and supply; Private community; Sharing ratio enforcement; Systemic risk","Credit policy; Demand and supply; Private communities; Sharing ratio enforcement; Systemic risks; Hardware; Signal processing; Peer to peer networks","Parallel and Distributed Systems Group, Mekelweg 4, 2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",,,10459219,,ITDSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Parallel Distrib Syst",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887954940

At the same time, how well they perform has major implications for global energy supply and security. The chapter argues that it is important to provide a nuanced assessment of NOCs. NOCs that perform well will enhance oil sector performance and, whilst serving domestic economic policies and governance, contribute importantly to domestic sustainable development and stability. Yet, the chapter argues, it is imperative to avoid the apparent systemic risks for global oil markets associated with NOCs. The call on global energy policy therefore consists in ensuring NOC performance, which requires both domestic and international political will, i.e., commitment at the highest levels to the support of institutional capacity, transparency, and accountability. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

One of the key elements of this has been a framework to contain the moral hazard and the negative externalities related to systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Regulators are seeking to make these institutions more resilient and to avoid future defaults. Another line of defense in this context is a more efficient restructuring and resolution regime. Against this backdrop, there has been increased interest on the part of policymakers in quantitative indicators measuring systemic importance. Based on indicator categories proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) we illustrate how, in principle, a set of indicators like this can be used to monitor the development of banks' systemic importance over time. Overall, the set of indicators suggests that the systemic importance of large German banks has declined somewhat over the last 4 years. This finding appears to be driven mostly, however, by factors other than new policies directly addressing the too-important-to-fail-problem, chiefly the difficult economic environment. Therefore, it is still too early for a final judgment on the effectiveness of such policies. Given that credit rating-based measures of systemic government support suggest that large German banks are still benefitting from a substantial public subsidy, it may be necessary to consider additional policy measures over the medium term. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.

However, other systemic risk factors of OMJ remain unclear. Importantly, the possibility of risk classification based on the clinical characteristics of patients has not been explored. Here, we clarified risk factors of OMJ and evaluate the predictive accuracy of risk indices in osteoporosis patients. Methods: We performed sub-analysis using a database developed for a retrospective cohort study in patients taking medications for osteoporosis at Kyoto University Hospital. Risk indices for OMJ were constructed using logistic regression analysis, and odds ratios (OR) for OMJ cases and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Potential risk factors included in the statistical analysis were age; sex; diabetes; use of oral BPs, corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, antirheumatic drugs, and biologic agents; and their interactions. Risk indices were calculated by the sum of potential risk factors of an individual patient multiplied by the regression coefficients. The discriminatory power of the risk indices was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: In analysis of all patients, oral BPs (OR: 4.98, 95% CIs: 1.94-12.75), age (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.06-1.60) and sex-chemotherapy interaction (OR: 11.70, 95% CI: 1.46-93.64) were significant risk factors of OMJ. Areas under the ROC curves of these risk indices provided moderate sensitivity or specificity regardless of group (0.683 to 0.718). Conclusions: Our data suggest that oral BP use, age, and sex-chemotherapy are predictors of OMJ in osteoporosis patients. The risk indices are moderately high, and allow the prediction of OMJ incidence. © 2013 Yamazaki et al.",,"alendronic acid; antirheumatic agent; biological product; bisphosphonic acid derivative; corticosteroid; etidronic acid; minodronic acid; risedronic acid; adult; age distribution; aged; analytical parameters; article; cancer chemotherapy; cohort analysis; controlled study; data base; diabetes mellitus; female; human; Japan; jaw disease; major clinical study; male; osteomyelitis; osteoporosis; predictive accuracy; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; sex difference; university hospital; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Japan; Jaw Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Osteomyelitis; Osteoporosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, , Kyoto, Japan",,,19326203,,POLNC,"24223935","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891412095

Methods: This is a cross sectional study conducted at the Department of Optometry, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Qassim, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from December 2010 to May 2011. One hundred patients suspected of keratitis were subjected to clinical examinations. A total of 115 corneal swabs from these cases were collected under aseptic conditions for bacteriological examinations. Results: Culture of the corneal swabs revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.7%), and unclassified bacteria 13.9%). However, 52 swabs of infectious keratitis cases 45.2%) were negative to bacteria. Contact lens wearing 44.4%) was the most common risk factor among the examined patients, followed by corneal trauma 21.7%), ocular surface disease 11.3%), and corneal surgery 7%). No significant correlation was observed between systemic risk factor and clinical presentation. Conclusion: It could be concluded that infectious keratitis was mostly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

Materials and methods The authors, directly involved with the recent publication of the Raccomandazioni clinico-terapeutiche sull'osteonecrosi delle ossa mascellari associata a bisfosfonati e sua prevenzione, endorsed by Società Italiana di Chirurgia Maxillo-Facciale (SICMF) and Società Italiana di Patologia e Medicina Orale (SIPMO), reviewed the relevant literature on ONJ associated with bisphosphonates, denosumab and anti-angiogenic drugs. They report all known epidemiological data and describe the clinical features of the disease; they also display the local and systemic risk factors associated with ONJ development, and present novel criteria for the diagnosis and staging of ONJ. Finally, they provide recommendations for prevention and dental management of cancer and non-cancer, mainly osteoporotic, patients, and summarize the medical and surgical therapies to be used in case of established ONJ. Results and conclusions ONJ, which is usually associated with bisphosphonates and more recently also with denosumab and anti-angiogenic drugs, is one of the most emergent among severe oral diseases, with important implications for the patient's quality of life: in the last decade, thousands of cases have been reported in the literature. The medical and dental communities fear the severity of this condition and solicit for rules, protocols, preventive measures for patients at risk of bisphosphonate related ONJ occurrence, as well as therapies for established ONJ. This effort has been carried out extensively in several countries, including Italy with the support of the Italian SICMF and SIPMO, leading to the publication of expert panel recommendations for prevention and therapy of ONJ, both in cancer and less frequently non-cancer (mainly osteoporotic) patients.","Anti-angiogenics; Bisphosphonates; Denosumab; Jaw osteonecrosis; Oral pathology","angiogenesis inhibitor; bisphosphonic acid derivative; denosumab; article; cancer patient; clinical feature; disease association; disease severity; human; jaw osteonecrosis; mouth disease; neoplasm; osteoporosis; quality of life; risk factor","Campisi, G.; Settore di Medicina Orale, Italy; email: campisi@odonto.unipa.it",,,00118524,,,,"Italian","Dent.

A useful algorithm should fit for each type of prosthetic joint infection, even the most complicated situations. We present the outcome of 147 patients with prosthetic joint infections of the hip or the knee joint in an unselected population in clinical routine. Methods: Between November 2006 and November 2009, 147 consecutive patients with prosthetic joint infections of the hip or knee were treated according to an algorithm based on the concept published by Zimmerli et al. in 2004. Causative organism, duration of infection, patient comorbidities, surgical treatment, antibiotic treatment, and outcome of treatment were analysed retrospectively. According to the criteria duration of infection, stability of prosthesis, local and systemic risk factors, and susceptibility of the causative pathogen, patients were treated either with debridement and retention or a long-interval two-stage procedure. Results: A pathogen could be detected in 82.8 % of the patients, gram-positive cocci being most common. Twenty-seven patients were treated with debridement and retention and 120 were treated with a two-stage procedure. In 68 cases difficult-to-treat pathogens could be detected, a polymicrobial infection was found in 51 patients. Definitely free of infection were 71.6 % after a two-stage procedure, and 70.4 % after debridement and retention. Conclusions: Our data indicates that the applied algorithm is suitable to be applied as a day-to-day routine, and we confirmed that published results from the literature can be reproduced in an inhomogeneous patient cohort. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"antibiotic agent; adult; aged; algorithm; antibiotic therapy; article; clinical evaluation; debridement; disease duration; female; Gram positive cocci; hip; human; interdisciplinary therapy algorithm; intraoperative period; joint aspiration; knee; major clinical study; male; periprosthetic joint infection; preoperative period; priority journal; prosthesis fixation; reimplantation; treatment failure; treatment response; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Cohort Studies; Debridement; Disease Management; Female; Hip Joint; Hip Prosthesis; Humans; Knee Joint; Knee Prosthesis; Male; Middle Aged; Prosthesis-Related Infections; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome","Wimmer, M.D.; Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, , Bonn 53105, Germany; email: wimmer@uni-bonn.de",,,03412695,,IORTD,"23851647","English","Int.

A major determinant of systemic risk is the interconnectedness of the international financial market. We propose to analyze interdependencies in the financial market using copulas, in particular using flexible vine copulas, which overcome limitations of the popular elliptical and Archimedean copulas. To investigate contagion effects among financial institutions, we develop methods for stress testing by exploiting the underlying dependence structure. New approaches for Archimedean and, especially, for vine copulas are derived. In a case study of 38 major international institutions, 20 insurers and 18 banks, we then analyze interdependencies of CDS spreads and perform a systemic risk stress test. The specified dependence model and the results from the stress test provide new insights into the interconnectedness of banks and insurers. In particular, the failure of a bank seems to constitute a larger systemic risk than the failure of an insurer. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","CDS spreads; Multivariate copula; Sampling; Stress testing; Systemic risk; Vine copula",,"Brechmann, E.C.; Center for Mathematical Sciences, Germany; email: eike.brechmann@tum.de",,,01676687,,IMECD,,"English","Insur.

This paper proposes a reformulation, in terms of urban risk management, of an earlier developed ontological scenario generation method. The procedure consists of several steps: (i) identification-and-prioritization of main pressures, (ii) paired discussion of pressures using four-cell matrices, (iii) re-visit of the pressures' priority order, (iv) articulation of short-listed pressures as decision-making questions, and (v) generation of scenarios via ""yes/no"" responses to each question, in their order of priority. In this article, the method feeds upon the general context described in recent multi-disciplinary urban studies and public strategic plans in the city of Iasi (Romania), to propose a formal procedure for enabling the acceleration of productive decision making towards city sustainability. Answering three top priority questions, namely ""Implement a business-friendly and efficient governance system?"", ""Develop a resource management system?"", and ""Carry out a human capital accelerator strategy?"" results in a 4-scenario set: Receding City, Wanting City, Promising City, Inspiring City.

The Systemic Assessment of Financial Environment (SAFE) EWS monitors microprudential information from the largest bank holding companies to anticipate the buildup of macroeconomic stresses in the financial markets. To mitigate inherent uncertainty, SAFE develops a set of medium-term forecasting specifications that gives policymakers enough time to take ex-ante policy action and a set of short-term forecasting specifications for verification and adjustment of supervisory actions.

The transmission of financial distress is governed by a heterogeneous interbank credit network and an investment portfolio of banks. Bankruptcy reproductive ratio of a financial system is computed as a function of the diversity and risk exposure of an investment portfolio of banks, and the denseness and concentration of a heterogeneous interbank credit network. An analytic solution of the bankruptcy reproductive ratio for a small financial system is derived and a numerical solution for a large financial system is obtained. For a large financial system, large diversity among banks in the investment portfolio makes financial contagion more damaging on the average. But large diversity is essentially effective in eliminating the risk of financial contagion in the worst case of financial crisis scenarios. A bank-unique specialization portfolio is more suitable than a uniform diversification portfolio and a system-wide specialization portfolio in strengthening the robustness of a financial system. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Analytic solution; Financial contagions; Financial crisis; Financial distress; Financial system; Investment portfolio; Numerical solution; Optimal portfolios; Artificial intelligence; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Investments","NEC Corporation, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa 211-8666, Japan",,,,9781467359214,,,"English","Proc.

We show that this problem is equivalent to a linear program. In addition, we address the problem of allocating the cash injection amount so as to minimize the number of nodes in default. For this problem, we develop an approximate algorithm which uses reweighted ℓ1 minimization. We illustrate this algorithm using two synthetic network structures for which the optimal solution can be calculated exactly. We show through numerical simulations that the solutions calculated by our algorithm are close to optimal. © 2013 IEEE.","contagion; financial systems; networks; optimal resource allocation; Risk; sparsity","Approximate algorithms; contagion; Financial networks; Financial system; Optimal resource allocation; Quantitative frameworks; sparsity; Synthetic networks; Algorithms; Networks (circuits); Risks; Signal processing; Optimization","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, , West Lafayette, IN 47906, United States",,,15206149,9781479903566,IPROD,,"English","ICASSP IEEE Int Conf Acoust Speech Signal Process Proc",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890469634

The focus is put on the simulation of scenarios, based on deterministic adverse event input, which are applied to the case study of an effusive eruption on the Mount Cameroon vlcano, resulting in the damage estimation of the assets located in the area. The work is based on the recent advances in the field of seismic risk. A software for systemic risk scenario analysis developed within the FP7 project SYNER-G has been adapted to address the issue of volcanic risk. Most significant improvements include the addition of vulnerability models adapted to each kind of exposed element and the possibility to quantify the successive potential damages inflicted by a sequence of adverse events (e.g. lava flows, tephra fall, etc.). The use of an object-oriented architecture gives the oportunity to model and compute the physical damage of very disparate types of infrastructures under the same framework. Finally, while the risk scenario approach is limited to the assessment of the physical impact of adverse events, a specific focus on strategic infrastructures and a dialogue with stakeholders helps in evaluating the potential wider indirect consequences of an eruption.© 2013 Author(s).",,"computer simulation; numerical model; risk assessment; software; strategic approach; vulnerability; Cameroon; Mount Cameroon; Sud Ouest Province","Gehl, P.; BRGM, 3 avenue Claude Guillemin, 45060 Orléans Cedex 2, France; email: p.gehl@brgm.fr",,,15618633,,,,"English","Nat.

The currently preferred policy option is the regulation of capital requirements, with the main focus on combating procyclicality and on identifying the banks that have a high systemic importance, those that are ""too big to fail"". Here we argue that the concept of systemic risk should include the analysis of the system as a whole and we explore systematically the most important properties for policy purposes of networks topology on resistance to shocks. In a thorough study going from analytical models to empirical data, we show two sharp transitions from safe to risky regimes: 1) diversification becomes harmful with just a small fraction (∼2%) of the shocks sampled from a fat tailed shock distributions and 2) when large shocks are present a critical link density exists where an effective giant cluster forms and most firms become vulnerable. This threshold depends on the network topology, especially on modularity. Firm size heterogeneity has important but diverse effects that are heavily dependent on shock characteristics. Similarly, degree heterogeneity increases vulnerability only when shocks are directed at the most connected firms. Furthermore, by studying the structure of the core of the transnational corporation network from real data, we show that its stability could be clearly increased by removing some of the links with highest centrality betweeness. Our results provide a novel insight and arguments for policy makers to focus surveillance on the connections between firms, in addition to capital requirements directed at the nodes. © 2013 Loepfe et al.

Over time, antitrust enforcement has come to focus exclusively on market power, the ability to raise prices or reduce output in narrowly defined product markets. This article calls for a return to the wisdom of days past, less for the populist reasons then articulated, and more due to the 'influence effect', the scale and scope economies in procuring political influence and their detrimental effects on democracy. After delving into the market and political effects created by big business, the recent financial crises and Too-Big- To-Fail (TBTF) dynamic are discussed. The main problem, it is argued, is not potential business failures and resulting bailouts, but the influence TBTF institutions exert 'while business is going well'. Preventing excess economic power and TBTF firms is a task originally entrusted to antitrust agencies, and this article calls for reaffirming this obligation. There are practical difficulties and political risks inherent in combating economic power, and these are discussed. In the end, such difficulties are very real and require careful formulation of enforcement strategy, but antitrust agencies should not shy away from the task. © The Author 2013.

Recently, Beale et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108, 12647 (2011)] demonstrated that higher portfolio diversity among banks would reduce systemic risk by decreasing the risk of simultaneous defaults at the expense of a higher likelihood of individual defaults. In practice, however, a bank default has an externality in that it undermines other banks' balance sheets. This paper explores how each of these different sources of risk, simultaneity risk and externality, contributes to systemic risk. The results show that the allocation of external assets that minimizes systemic risk varies with the topology of the financial network as long as asset returns have negative correlations. In the model, a well-known centrality measure, PageRank, reflects an appropriately defined ""infectiveness"" of a bank. An important result is that the most infective bank needs not always to be the safest bank. Under certain circumstances, the most infective node should act as a firewall to prevent large-scale collective defaults. The introduction of a counteractive portfolio structure will significantly reduce systemic risk.© EDP Sciences Società Italiana di Fisica Springer-Verlag 2013.",,"Balance sheets; Centrality measures; Financial networks; Financial system; Global financial crisis; Infective nodes; Negative correlation; Systemic risks; Condensed matter physics; Physics; Finance","Kobayashia, T.; Graduate School of Economics, 2-1 Rokkodai-cho, Nada-ku, Kobe 657-8501, Japan; email: kobayashi@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp",,,14346028,,,,"English","Eur.

We then examine how a bank's risk and return on equity, its activity mix and funding strategy, and the extent to which it faces market discipline depend on both size measures. We show that bank returns increase with absolute size, yet decline with systemic size, while neither size measure is associated with bank risk as implicit in the Z-score. These results are consistent with the view that growing to a size that is systemic is not in the interest of bank shareholders. We also find that systemically large banks are subject to greater market discipline as evidenced by a higher sensitivity of their funding costs to risk proxies, consistent with the view that they can become too large to save. A bank's interest costs, however, are estimated to decline with bank systemic size for all banks apart from those with very low capitalization levels. This suggests that market discipline, exercised through funding costs, does not prevent banks from attaining larger systemic size. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Bank size; Market discipline; Systemic risk",,"Huizinga, H.; Tilburg UniversityNetherlands; email: Huizinga@uvt.nl",,,10429573,,,,"English","J.

We investigate whether large size provides any cost advantages to the economy and, if so, whether these cost advantages are due to technological scale economies or too-big-to-fail subsidies. Estimating scale economies is made more complex by risk-taking. Better diversification resulting from larger scale generates scale economies but also incentives to take more risk. When this additional risk-taking adds to cost, it can obscure the underlying scale economies and engender misleading econometric estimates of them. Using data pre- and post-crisis, we estimate scale economies using two production models. The standard model ignores endogenous risk-taking and finds little evidence of scale economies. The model accounting for managerial risk preferences and endogenous risk-taking finds large scale economies, which are not driven by too-big-to-fail considerations.

We show that distressed selling by investors exiting a fund and short selling of the fund's positions by traders may have nonnegligible impact on the realized correlations between returns of assets held by the fund. These feedback effects may lead to positive realized correlations between fundamentally uncorrelated assets, as well as an increase in correlations across all asset classes and in the fund's volatility which is exacerbated in scenarios in which the fund undergoes large losses. By studying the diffusion limit of our discrete time model, we obtain analytical expressions for the realized covariance and show that the realized covariance may be decomposed as the sum of a fundamental covariance and a liquidity-dependent ""excess"" covariance.

We show how the number of imprudent intermediaries is determined in equilibrium jointly with the interest rate, and how both ultimately depend on the cross-sectional distribution of intermediaries' capital. One implication of our analysis is that an exogenous increase in the supply of funds to the intermediary sector lowers interest rates and raises the number of imprudent intermediaries.

We use a special form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP) technique to evolve a stock market divided into two groups - a small subset of artificial agents called 'Best Agents' and a main cohort of agents named 'All Agents'. The 'Best Agents' perform best in term of the trailing return of a wealth moving average. We then investigate whether herding behaviour can arise when agents trade Dow Jones, General Electric, and IBM financial instruments in four different artificial stock markets. This paper uses real historical quotes of the three financial instruments to analyse the behavioural foundations of stylised facts such as leptokurtosis, non-IIDness, and volatility clustering. We found evidence of more herding in a group of stocks than in individual stocks, but the magnitude of herding does not contribute to the mispricing of assets in the long run. Our findings suggest that the price formation process caused by the collective behaviour of the entire market exhibit less herding and is more efficient than the segmented market populated by a small subset of agents. Hence, greater genetic diversity leads to greater consistency with fundamental values and market efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To expand the scope of private funding for public works and service investment plans, the Taiwanese government proposed the introduction of private finance initiative (PFI) models in 2012. Consequently, Taiwan will encounter issues concerning the selection of traditional government self-financed, BOT, and PFI models for future public works investments. In response to the future introduction of policies related to PFI models in Taiwan, this study developed setting standards for discount rates, a key parameter required for assessing the suitability of PFI models. The theoretical framework is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The parameter data used in trial calculations were collected from the historical case data recorded in the Public Construction Bid Management Information System of the Public Construction Commission, Executive Yuan, and employed in further analyses and imputations.

Current research mostly concentrates on the positive effect resulting from the statistical multiplexing gain. However, the negative effect resulting from the unavoidable overhead, e.g., due to coordination or delays for accessing distant resources, may outweight the positive effect. This possibility has been demonstrated analytically and through simulations as well as has been observed in operational networks with dynamic routing, when a positive effect of bandwidth sharing is offset by using unnecessary long routes. Emergence and proliferation of cloud computing necessitates better understanding of the risk of cascading overload in highly distributed complex resource sharing systems. This paper, which represents work in progress, attempts to make a case for the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of the mean-field equations linearized about the 'operational' system equilibrium to be viewed as a measure of the systemic risk of cascading overload in complex resource sharing systems. For simplicity of the exposition we consider a loss service model.

By contrast, classical insurance is more desirable when the bank’s individual risk is consistent with the expected loss in a precise way. Our analysis shows that a capital insurance program is a useful tool to hedge systemic risk from the regulatory perspective. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Capital insurance; Equilibrium; Welfare",,"Tian, W.; Belk College of Business, United States; email: wtian1@uncc.edu",,"MDPI",22279091,,,,"English","Risks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079451226

It is also illustrated how the existence of huge disasters may lead to wrong solutions of our optimal risk sharing problem, in the sense that the involved risk measure could ignore the existence of a non-null probability of “global ruin” after the design of the optimal risk sharing strategy. To overcome this caveat, one can use more conservative risk measures. The stability in the large of the optimal sharing plan guarantees that “the global ruin caveat” may be also addressed and solved with the presented methods. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","General risk measure; Optimal reinsurance; Risk sharing; Systemic risk",,"Balbas, A.; University Carlos III of Madrid, CL.

To date, therapeutic approaches have demonstrated variable results and have significant ocular and systemic risks. We present 2 cases of pediatric orbital lymphangioma that responded to treatment with oral sildenafil. OBSERVATIONS This is a report of a series of 2 patients at the University of California-Davis Medical Center treated between March 2011 and October 2012. The first patient was a 12-month-old male infant whose extensive orbital and facial lymphangioma responded to sildenafil after repeated sclerosing and drainage procedures failed to achieve remission. The second patient was a 12-year-old boy whose orbital lymphangioma and associated ocular pain improved with sildenafil, making enucleation unnecessary. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These reported cases demonstrate promise for sildenafil as a noninvasive therapy for pediatric lymphangioma.

Methods: In this retrospective comparative case series, eyes with polymicrobial and monomicrobial keratitis were identified from microbiological records at a tertiary academic referral center, from January 2002 to December 2010. Only culture positive cases were included. Eyes with infectious keratitis involving two or more pathogens were included in the polymicrobial group, whereas eyes infected solely by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were included in the monomicrobial group. Various parameters including demographics, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: Twenty-one eyes each with polymicrobial and monomicrobial keratitis were included in this study. The mean age of polymicrobial patients was significantly higher than monomicrobials. Use of contact lens was the commonest predisposing factor in both groups. Systemic (23.8%) and multiple (33.3%) risk factors were involved in eyes with polymicrobial keratitis only. The mean size of corneal infiltrates and mean duration for resolvement of infection were significantly greater in the polymicrobial group. Medical treatment was successful only in 80.9% eyes with polymicrobial keratitis, whereas all monomicrobial keratitis patients responded to it. A total of 44 organisms belonging to 18 species (bacteria = 13, fungi = 5) were isolated from the polymicrobial group. P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans were the most frequently isolated bacteria (n = 12) and fungi (n = 5), respectively. In the polymicrobial group, gram-negative organisms were most sensitive to gentamicin (87.8%), followed by ciprofloxacin (78.7%), whereas gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to ciprofloxacin and cefazolin. Conclusions: A high index of suspicion of polymicrobial keratitis should be made in patients with multiple and systemic risk factors. Contact lens usage was the most common risk factor in both groups. Size of corneal infiltrate is a fairly reliable indicator for suspecting polymicrobial keratitis. Prolonged course of the disease and decreased antibiotic sensitivity were the other notable features of polymicrobial keratitis. © 2013 Contact Lens Association of Opthalmologists, Inc.","Keratitis; Monomicrobial; Polymicrobial","antifungal agent; cefazolin; ciprofloxacin; fusidic acid; gentamicin; imipenem; piperacillin; adult; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; article; bacterial keratitis; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; Candida albicans; clinical article; clinical feature; contact lens; controlled study; cornea disease; cornea infiltrate; demography; disease duration; evisceration; eye; female; fungus; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; human; keratomycosis; keratoplasty; male; medical record; microbiological examination; monomicrobial keratitis; patient referral; polymicrobial keratitis; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; retrospective study; risk factor; tertiary health care; treatment outcome; treatment response; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Contact Lenses; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; Female; Fungi; Humans; Keratitis; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Ray, M.; Department of Ophthalmology, 1E, Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119228, Singapore; email: mantoshr@yahoo.com",,,15422321,,,"23945525","English","Eye Contact Lens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883744218

We focus on the five categories that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently proposed as indicators of systemic importance. Our findings suggest that unstable funding is the main factor driving systemic risk. Furthermore, the combination of significant trading activities with global presence appears to exacerbate spillover risks to the global financial system. Interestingly, whereas trading activities contribute to the build-up of correlated or 'wrong-way' risk they help to mitigate individual solvency risk. Conversely, a decentralized approach to liquidity management seems to alleviate individual solvency risk but amplifies the transmission of financial distress across the financial system. This suggests that a macro-prudential approach to financial regulation should focus not only on scaling up micro-prudential measures but also on enabling the efficient transfer of risk between financial institutions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Correlated risks; CoVaR; Financial regulation; Individual risk; Systemic risk",,"López-Espinosa, G.; School of Economics and Business Administration, Spain; email: glespinosa@unav.es",,,15723089,,,,"English","J.

In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since then - most notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels. Conventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on/risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on/risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory. How can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent? How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited? Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system? These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Proper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on/risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility. Apart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead. © 2013 Clive Corcoran.

On the one hand, banks can focus on relationship banking and use IT developments to tailor services to individual needs and build enhanced, albeit modified, relationships with customers. On the other hand, IT better allows banks to exploit economies of scale and scope, which are most evident in transaction banking. Another manifestation of IT is via financial innovations that have enhanced marketability. Stability enters the picture because increased marketability facilitates opportunistic behavior. Together with enhanced herding behavior and changes in industry structure, this could undermine stability and augment systemic risk, calling for a regulatory overhaul. © 2013 IEEE.","Banking; Information technology; Relationship banking; Sarmayeh Bank; Stability; Systemic risk","Banking; Economies of scale; Financial innovation; Herding behaviors; Industry structures; Relationship banking; Sarmayeh Bank; Systemic risks; Convergence of numerical methods; Developing countries; Electronic commerce; Stability; Information technology","Department of Management, , Shiraz, Iran",,,,9781479903931,,,"English","Int.

Glaucoma's etiology remains unknown, its physiopathology is poorly understood and its diagnosis is often difficult. It is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and it is the real ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision often occurs gradually over a long period of time, and symptoms only occur when the disease is quite advanced. Cost-effectiveness analyses for POAG screening are weighted by the degree of uncertainty that glaucoma screening can be effective and reliable achieved.

On the one hand, the complexity metaphor - as other crisis metaphors commonly do - naturalised turmoil and obscured agency as it subjectified complexity itself as a key driver of instability. On the other hand, it marked a departure from narratives of recent crises insofar as it has pointed explicitly to an epistemological crisis underlying financial turmoil. Such framing of the crisis yielded a powerful theoretical challenge to classical neoliberal assumptions about the exogenous nature of financial turmoil and helped shape a new consensus around the imperative of macroprudential regulation. However, the embrace of the complexity lens may remain relatively ambiguous. Though highlighting properties that render the financial system 'complex' and hence unpredictable, it ambitions to 'manage' complexity with better methodological tools. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","complexity; financial crisis; macroprudential regulation; metaphor; systemic risk","complexity; economic policy; financial crisis; financial system; neoliberalism","Datz, G.; School of Public and International Affairs, 1021 Prince Street, Alexandria, 22814, United States; email: gdatz@vt.edu",,,13563467,,,,"English","New Polit.

They remained almost unchanged in recent decades, whereas the banking landscape underwent a tremendous metamorphosis. Market-oriented banking is characterized by a new type of systemic risk, a risk which essentially evolves off the radar screen, i.e., off-balance sheet (OBS) (Calmès and Théoret Journal of Banking and Finance 34 (7): 1719-1728, 2010, 2011). In this article, we argue that the standard leverage indicators are not fitted to capture this kind of new banking risk. We introduce a new empirical framework which enables us to exploit the cyclical properties of elasticity leverage measures, while at the same time controlling for the noisy information they usually deliver. In a nutshell, thanks to the Kalman filter, we are able to compute optimal levels of bank leverage. This methodology delivers cyclical, forward-looking measures signalling systemic risk bubbles years before their burst. By properly accounting for all activities, including market-oriented banking, these time-varying leverage measures tend to systemically capture regulatory capital arbitrage and the OBS risk it entails. © 2013 International Atlantic Economic Society.","Banking; Kalman Filter; Leverage; Liquidity; OBS activities",,"Calmès, C.; Chaire d'information financière et organisationnelle, 101 St-Jean-Bosco, Gatineau, QC, Canada; email: christian.calmes@uqo.ca",,,10830898,,,,"English","Int.

In this paper, we address these issues along two related perspectives. First, we explore the statistical properties of the International Financial Network (IFN), defined as a weighted-directed graph where nodes are countries and links represent debtor-creditor relationships in equities and short/long-run debt. We investigate whether the 2008 financial crisis has resulted in a significant change in the topological properties of the IFN. Our findings suggest that the crisis caused not only a reduction in the amount of securities traded, but also induced changes in the topology of the network and in the time evolution of its statistical properties. This has happened, however, without changing the disassortative, core-periphery structure of the IFN architecture. Second, we perform an econometric study to examine the ability of network-based measures to explain cross-country differences in crisis intensity. We investigate whether the conclusion of previous studies showing that international connectedness is not a relevant predictor of crisis intensity may be reversed, once one explicitly accounts for the position of each country within the IFN.

Concerns had been raised, even prior to the recent financial crisis, about the vulnerability of the U.S. financial system to infrastructure failure. These concerns about the ""plumbing"" of the financial system were heightened following the market disruptions of the recent crisis. The financial market infrastructure consists of the various systems, networks, and technological processes that are necessary for conducting and completing financial transactions. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203, the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010, introduces the term ""financial market utility"" (FMU or utility) for those multilateral systems that transfer, clear, or settle payments, securities, or other financial transactions among financial institutions (FI) or between an FMU and a financial institution. Utilities and FIs transfer funds and settle accounts with other financial institutions to facilitate normal day-to-day transactions occurring in the U.S. economy. Those transfers include payroll and mortgage payments, foreign currency exchanges, purchases of U.S. treasury bonds and corporate securities, and derivatives trades. Further, financial institutions engage in commercial paper and securities repurchase agreements (repo) markets that contribute to liquidity in the U.S. economy. In the United States, some of the key payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) systems are operated by the Federal Reserve, and other systems are operated by private sector organizations. With Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted on July 21, 2010, Congress added a new regulatory framework for the FMUs and PCS activities (of FIs) designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as systemically important. On July 18, 2012, the Council voted unanimously to designate eight FMUs as systemically important. Title VIII expands the Federal Reserve's role, in coordination with those of other prudential regulators, in the supervision, examination, and rule enforcement with respect to those FMUs and PCS activities of financial institutions. Additionally, FMUs may borrow from the discount window of the Federal Reserve in certain unusual and exigent circumstances. Although Title VIII primarily affects the scope of regulatory powers, certain provisions directly affect a utility's business operations. For example, Title VIII allows FMUs to maintain accounts at a Federal Reserve Bank and provides access to the Fed's discount window in unusual and exigent circumstances. Related to PCS, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes requirements that will significantly affect the business of clearinghouses in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives (swaps) market. By requiring clearing of certain swap transactions through central counterparties (CCPs or clearinghouses), Title VII is expected to increase the volume of transactions processed by clearing systems subject to Title VIII. Critics contend that Title VIII grants too much discretionary authority to the Fed in an area that they argue was not a source of systemic risk during the recent financial crisis. S. 3497 seeks to repeal Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, stripping FSOC of it's authority to designate FMUs as systemically important. This report outlines the changes to the supervision of key market infrastructure that are embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act. It is intended to be used as a reference for those interested in the financial system's ""plumbing,"" and how the associated systems are currently overseen and regulated. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A number of firms used derivatives to construct highly leveraged speculative positions, which generated enormous losses that threatened to bankrupt not only the firms themselves but also their creditors and trading partners. Hundreds of billions of dollars in government credit were needed to prevent such losses from cascading throughout the system. AIG was the best-known example, but by no means the only one. Equally troublesome was the fact that the OTC market depended on the financial stability of a dozen or so major dealers. Failure of a dealer would have resulted in the nullification of trillions of dollars worth of contracts and would have exposed derivatives counterparties to sudden risk and loss, exacerbating the cycle of deleveraging and withholding of credit that characterized the crisis. During the crisis, all the major dealers came under stress, and even though derivatives dealing was not generally the direct source of financial weakness, a collapse of the $600 trillion OTC derivatives market was imminent absent federal intervention. The first group of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. The Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) sought to remake the OTC market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges. Crucial reforms include a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by one or more federal agencies. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash (called initial margin) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses, and require subsequent deposits (called maintenance margin) to cover actual losses to the position. The intended effect of margin requirements is to eliminate the possibility that any firm can build up an uncapitalized exposure so large that default would have systemic consequences (again, the AIG situation). The size of a cleared position is limited by the firm's ability to post capital to cover its losses. That capital protects its trading partners and the system as a whole. Swap dealers and major swap participants-firms with substantial derivatives positions-will be subject to margin and capital requirements above and beyond what the clearinghouses mandate. Swaps that are cleared will also be subject to trading on an exchange, or an exchangelike ""swap execution facility,"" regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the case of security-based swaps. All trades will be reported to data repositories, so that regulators will have complete information about all derivatives positions. Data on swap prices and trading volumes will be made public. The Dodd-Frank Act provides exceptions to the clearing and trading requirements for commercial end-users, or firms that use derivatives to hedge the risks of their nonfinancial business operations. Regulators may also provide exemptions for smaller financial institutions. Even trades that are exempt from the clearing and exchange-trading requirements, however, will have to be reported to data repositories or directly to regulators.

Panel VAR model estimates for the 48 states show bank failures aggravate commercial non-bank failures. Institutional and regulatory features affect the intensity of the bank failure effect. We find that bank failures have a larger impact in states with deposit insurance, in states more heavily concentrated in agriculture, and in states with fewer large firms. However, because a number of states exhibit all three characteristics, we are not able to clearly identify the true marginal effects of these factors independently. © 2012.","Bank failures; Credit channel; Non-bank commercial failures; Output growth; Systemic risk; Vector autoregressions",,"Kupiec, P.H.; Division of Insurance and Research, 550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429, United States; email: pkupiec@fdic.gov",,,10429573,,,,"English","J.

First, what is the raison d'être of open global markets? Second, is it possible to foster open markets without an international governance structure supervising them? Post-crisis regulatory reform presents an acute paradox. While the content of international financial regulation is changing rapidly, the reform of governance structures is painfully slow. There is no formal governance structure dealing with cross-border supervision of global financial institutions. In addition, there is no crystallized institutional capacity at the international level dealing with cross-border crises and the resolution of global institutions. Other areas of concern are the global supervision of systemic risk and the absence of a reliable finance research watchdog dealing with the production of regulatory standards. This article outlines an international governance framework to deal effectively with these concerns. The adoption of the proposed plan would lead to breaking down the territorial link in the supervision of large financial institutions and of systemic risk, without causing intolerable loss of sovereignty. In addition, the proposed structure is premised on a set of explicit values. These would provide a strong signal to global markets that they need to shift their focus from speculation to development goals. © 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,"Avgouleas, E.; School of Law, United Kingdom",,,17585880,,,,"English","Global Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880341867

Friedman, MD, MPH, PhD CONTEXT Over the past decade, chronic illnesses with ophthalmic sequelae such as diabetes and diabetic retinopathy have increased. OBJECTIVES To estimate prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment and to describe its relationship with demographic and systemic risk factors including diagnosed diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized population. In 1999-2002 and 2005-2008, 9471 and 10 480 participants aged 20 years or older received questionnaires, laboratory tests, and physical examinations. Visual acuity of less than 20/40 aided by autorefractor was classified as nonrefractive visual impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Nonrefractive visual impairment. RESULTSWeighted prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment increased 21% among US adults aged 20 years and older from 1.4%in 1999-2002 to 1.7%in 2005-2008 (P = .03); and increased 40% among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.5%to 0.7%(P = .008). In multivariable analyses, statistically significant risk factors for nonrefractive visual impairment in 1999-2002 included age (per year odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95%CI, 1.05-1.09), poverty (OR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.31-3.64), lack of insurance (OR, 1.85; 95%CI, 1.16-2.95), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.15-3.25). In 2005-2008, risk factors included age (OR, 1.05; 95%CI, 1.04-1.07), poverty (OR, 2.23; 95%CI, 1.55-3.22), education less than high school (OR, 2.11; 95%CI, 1.54-2.90), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 2.67; 95%CI, 1.64-4.37). Prevalence of diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis increased 22%overall from 2.8%to 3.6% (P = .02); and 133%among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.3%to 0.7%(P < .001). CONCLUSION Prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment was significantly higher in 2005-2008 than in 1999-2002 and may be attributable, in part, to higher prevalence of diabetes, an associated risk factor that increased in prevalence during this time period.",,"adult; article; diabetic retinopathy; female; health insurance; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; poverty; priority journal; race difference; risk factor; visual acuity; visual impairment; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; Male; Vision Disorders","Klein, R.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, 610 n Walnut St, Madison, WI 53726, United States; email: kleinr@epi.ophth.wisc.edu",,,21686165,,,"24015401","English","JAMA Ophthalmol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880252249

If undiagnosed or untreated, this pathology represents a systemic risk factor and offers unfavorable conditions for dental treatments, especially those requiring bone healing. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate histologically and histochemically the effect of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy in enhancing bone repair in surgically extracted sockets of diabetic albino rats. Design: Thirty male Swiss Albino rats ranging from 200 to 250 g were used in this study. The experimental animals were randomly divided into three groups (10 animals each). The first lower right molar of the rats was extracted under general anesthesia. Group I acted as a control with surgical extracted sockets were left empty. Diabetes was induced by single intravenous injection of 60 mg/kg body wt streptozotocin (STZ) in the remaining 20 rats. The rats in the control group received a comparable injection of saline. The diabetic rats divided into two groups (10 animals each): group II; diabetic rats with empty sockets were left to heal spontaneously. While group III; diabetic rats in which, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were introduced into their sockets. Sacrification of animals was done after different time intervals. The MSCs were harvested from rat bone marrow. The two sides of each mandible were separated. The specimens were processed, decalcified and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination and Masson's trichrome for detection of collagen fibers. Results: MSCs accelerated bone healing in third group, while, diabetes induced delay of bone healing along the second diabetic group. This acceleration was assessed histologically by the presence of mature collagen fiber bundles and early new bone formation in the MSCs group. Histomorphometric analysis revealed an increase in the area percentage of bone trabeculae in the MSCs treated sockets compared to the control and diabetic ones. Conclusions: In a rat model of streptozotocin- induced diabetes, application of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can significantly enhance bone healing and mineralization in their sockets.","Bone healing; Bone marrow stem cells; Diabetes mellitus; Rats; Streptozotocin","Animalia; Rattus","Oral Biology Department, Egypt",,,10978135,,,,"English","Life Sci.

This scheme does not reduce the efficiency of the financial network, but fosters a more homogeneous risk-distribution within the system in a self-organized critical way.

Systemic risk is often seen as a problem of size, operational complexity, interconnectivity and contagion. It is less often discussed in terms of the institutional framework of legal rules and principles within which financial intermediation takes place, and the organizational culture promoted by those structures. In this article we redress this deficit through an appraisal of Northern Rock, illustrating the consequences of its transformation from mutually owned building society to publicly held company on organisational culture. These changes had profound effects on the incentive structure of its owners and managers, as profit-maximisation and shareholder value became the driving force within the firm, as in much of the rest of the UK banking sector. Thus, in addition to grappling with risk and uncertainty-and taking care to distinguish between the two-current efforts to construct a new macro-prudential regulatory paradigm should recognise the importance of Frank Knight's third key conceptual category-profit. Furthermore, in seeking to understand systemic risk, it becomes necessary to delve into micro-legal concepts such as property, trust, and contract that govern different forms of business to discern whether or not some modes of financial association create a greater degree of systemic risk than others. This is especially so when one organizational model comes to dominate retail markets, as did the publicly held company in the UK banking sector at the turn of the twenty-first century. © Author(s) 2013.","Banks; Building societies; Northern rock; Systemic risk; UK residential mortgages",,"Bholat, D.; Newcastle UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: david.bholat@newcastle.ac.uk",,"Kiel Institute for the World Economy",18646042,,,,"English","Economics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878975932

Systemic risk is an issue of great concern in modern financial markets as well as, more broadly, in the management of complex business and engineering systems. We propose an axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of systemic risk based on the simultaneous analysis of outcomes across agents in the system and over scenarios of nature. Our framework defines a broad class of systemic risk measures that accomodate a rich set of regulatory preferences. This general class of systemic risk measures captures many specific measures of systemic risk that have recently been proposed as special cases and highlights their implicit assumptions. Moreover, the systemic risk measures that satisfy our conditions yield decentralized decompositions; i.e., the systemic risk can be decomposed into risk due to individual agents. Furthermore, one can associate a shadow price for systemic risk to each agent that correctly accounts for the externalities of the agent's individual decision making on the entire system. © 2013 INFORMS.","Contagion; Risk attribution; Risk measures; Systemic risk","Axiomatic framework; Contagion; Engineering systems; Individual components; Individual decision making; Risk measures; Simultaneous analysis; Systemic risks; Economics; Risk perception","Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, , New York, NY 10027, United States",,,00251909,,MSCIA,,"English","Manage Sci",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878997624

However, we argue that this limited contagion effect might be associated with a lack of relevant data. A common assumption for the estimation of the matrices of exposures is to apply the maximum entropy principle to deal with data gaps; such an assumption might lead to an underestimation of contagion risk. In this paper, there are no data gaps and the information set is extended from interbank exposures alone to exposures among most of the financial intermediaries in the Mexican financial system (we even include exposures to some international foreign banks). Naturally, the contagion risk of an extended network of exposures changes with respect to the interbank exposures network, as there are many more institutions which can be the source of contagion and there are more institutions which can fail due to contagion. The most important contribution of this paper is that it provides evidence on financial contagion with an extended exposures network under stressful conditions. The results presented here support the international efforts by the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board to increase the amount of information available which can be used to assess systemic risk and contagion based on exposures and funding data. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Financial contagion; Interbank market; Interfinancial exposures; Macroeconomic stress testing; Systemic risk",,"Solorzano-Margain, J.

Our model can be used to simulate and assess interbank contagion effects on banking sector soundness and resilience. We find a strongly non-linear pattern across the distribution of simulated networks, whereby only for a small percentage of networks the impact of interbank contagion will substantially reducoe average solvency of the system. In the vast majority of the simulated networks the system-wide contagion effects are largely negligible. The approach furthermore enables to form a view about the most systemic banks in the system in terms of the banks whose failure would have the most detrimental contagion effects on the system as a whole. Finally, as the simulation of the network structures is computationally very costly, we also propose a simplified measure-a so-called Systemic Probability Index-that also captures the likelihood of contagion from the failure of a given bank to honour its interbank payment obligations but at the same time is less costly to compute.

Using non-parametric methods of estimating changes in the dependence structure in response to common shocks affecting individual risk profiles, possible linkages during periods of stress are quantifiable while recognizing that large shocks are transmitted across financial markets differently than small shocks. Before and during the initial phase of the financial crisis, we find that systemic risk increased globally as early as February 2007 - months before the unraveling of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The average (multivariate) dependence among a global sample of banks and insurance companies increased by almost 30% while joint tail risk declined by about the same order of magnitude, indicating that co-movements of large changes in equity volatility were more likely to occur and responses to extreme shocks became more differentiated as distress escalated. The key policy consideration flowing from our analysis is that complementary measures of joint tail risk at high data frequency are essential to the robust measurement of systemic risk, which could enhance market-based early warning mechanisms as part of macroprudential surveillance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Co-movement; Correlation; Dependence; Early warning; Entropy; Extreme value theory; Financial contagion; Generalized extreme value; Macroprudential surveillance; Systemic risk",,"Jobst, A.A.; Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), 43 Victoria Street, Hamilton, HM 12, Bermuda; email: ajobst@bma.bm",,,10575219,,,,"English","Int.

Identification of these risk factors helps to target patients for prevention and treatment, with modification of risk factors critical to the control of periodontal disease. Shifts in our understanding of periodontal disease prevalence, and advances in scientific methodology and statistical analysis in the last few decades, have allowed identification of several major systemic risk factors for periodontal disease. The first change in our thinking was the understanding that periodontal disease is not universal, but that severe forms are found only in a portion of the adult population who show abnormal susceptibility. Analysis of risk factors and the ability to statistically adjust and stratify populations to eliminate the effects of confounding factors have allowed identification of independent risk factors. These independent but modifiable, risk factors for periodontal disease include lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. They also include diseases and unhealthy conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and low dietary calcium and vitamin D. These risk factors are modifiable and their management is a major component of the contemporary care of many periodontal patients. Genetic factors also play a role in periodontal disease and allow one to target individuals for prevention and early detection. The role of genetic factors in aggressive periodontitis is clear. However, although genetic factors (i.e., specific genes) are strongly suspected to have an association with chronic adult periodontitis, there is as yet no clear evidence for this in the general population. It is important to pursue efforts to identify genetic factors associated with chronic periodontitis because such factors have potential in identifying patients who have a high susceptibility for development of this disease. Many of the systemic risk factors for periodontal disease, such as smoking, diabetes and obesity, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are relatively common and can be expected to affect most patients with periodontal disease seen in clinics and dental practices. Hence, risk factor identification and management has become a key component of care for periodontal patients. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",,"article; chronic disease; disease predisposition; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; lifestyle; periodontal disease; risk factor; Chronic Disease; Disease Susceptibility; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Life Style; Periodontal Diseases; Risk Factors","Genco, R.J.",,,09066713,,,"23574464","English","Periodontol. 2000",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876338643

We rely on two procedures: conditional modelling and Kalman filtering of hedge funds' alpha and beta. We find that hedge fund betas are usually procyclical.

It suggests how the government can enlist private ""gatekeeper guarantors"" to provide integrated insurance and monitoring roles to complement the government's management of systemic risk. It proposes the enactment of a federal mandate that requires systemically significant financial entities (or participants in systemically significant financial sectors) to secure private guarantees to cover a percentage of their potential liabilities above a loss threshold. Gatekeeper guarantors would act as ""circuit breakers"" of systemic risk by serving as self-interested monitors of risk taking and tying clients' coverage to ongoing constraints on risk taking. Gatekeeper guarantors would serve as ""bailout buffers"" by providing financial backing in the event of defaults and thereby mitigating the government's potential liability exposure. This expansive role would come with government oversight to ensure that gatekeeper guarantors satisfy reserve requirements, so that they can credibly serve as sea walls in the face of future financial tsunamis. This Article will illustrate the potential for decentralized risk management by showing how a mandate for private reinsurance (or its functional equivalent) may reduce systemic risk in the over-the-counter derivatives market. Reinsurers would bear a percentage of derivatives participants' liability, which would incentivize reinsurers to charge premiums reflecting their risk assessments and to monitor and condition clients' liability exposure. The repeat-player status of reinsurers would position them to force derivatives participants to change their risk exposure as market conditions unfold. Reinsurers would have leverage to push insured parties to demand disclosures from counterparties, thereby heightening transparency and reducing risks for their clients and the market as a whole. Government monitoring could build on existing state oversight of reinsurers, but it would also provide teeth with expanded reserve requirements to ensure reinsurers are equipped to handle this role.",,,"Manns, J.; Law School, United States",,,00210552,,,,"English","Iowa Law Rev.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880441154

From 2008 to 2012, 420 patients (448 eyes) with exudative AMD were prospectively registered at Seoul National University Hospital. From this group of patients,125 eyes were included in this study. All patients were treated with 3 consecutive IVRinjections. The visual acuity (VA) was evaluated at baseline and 1 month after the thirdranibizumab injection. To evaluate the risk factors associated with VA improvement afterIVR, patient demographic data and systemic risk factors were analyzed. Patients were divided into a poorVA improvement group and a good VA improvement group, withreference to the median visual improvement in all eyes. Among125 eyes, 66 eyes (52.8%)were included in the responder group and 59 eyes (47.2%) in the non-responder group.The medianVA improvement after 3 monthly ranibizumab injections was -0.05 logMAR.Multivariate analyses revealed that current smoking (adjusted OR, 7.540; 95% CI, 1.732-32.823) was independently associated with poor VA improvement after IVR treatment forexudative AMD.

Despite various national recommendations, efforts to achieve international harmonization of specific evidence-based recommendations for best practice are still lacking. Hypothesis: An international consensus study group should be able to develop recommendations on the use and monitoring of MoM bearings, preferably at the European level, through a multidisciplinary approach, by integrating the perspectives of various stakeholders. Materials and methods: Twenty-one experts representing three stakeholder groups and eight countries participated in this European consensus study, which consisted of a consensus meeting, subsequent structured discussion, and consensus voting. Results: The current statement defines first of all benefits, local and systemic risks, as well as uncertain issues related to MoM bearings. Safety assessment after implantation of MoM comprises all patients. A closer follow-up is recommended for large head MoM (≥36mm) and resurfacing. In these implants basic follow-up should consist of x-rays and metal ion measurement of cobalt in whole blood, performed with GF-AAS or ICP-MS. Clinical and/or radiographic abnormality as well as elevated ion levels needs additional imaging (ultrasound, CT-scan and/or MARS-MRI). Cobalt values less than 2. μg/L are probably devoid of clinical concern, the threshold value for clinical concern is expected to be within the range of 2-7. μg/L. Discussion: This is the first multinational, interdisciplinary, and multiprofessional approach for developing a recommendation for the use and monitoring of MoM bearings in total hip replacement. The current recommendations are in partial agreement with previous statements regarding the extent of follow-up and imaging techniques. They however differ from previous communications regarding measurement of metal ions and especially the investigated medium, technique, and eventual threshold levels.

If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to fail, this can induce a cascade of failures among neighboring agents. Several critical constellations determine whether this cascade affects the system in part or as a whole which, in the second case, leads to systemic risk. We investigate the critical parameters for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are characterized by an individual threshold θi determining their capacity to handle a load αθi with 1-α being their safety margin. If agents fail, they redistribute their load equally to K neighboring agents in a regular network. For three different threshold distributions P(θ), we derive analytical results for the size of the cascade, X(t), which is regarded as a measure of systemic risk, and the time when it stops. We focus on two different regimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the size of the shock is of the order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii) RIE, a random internal event where the size of the shock is of the order of the capacity of an agent. We find that even for large extreme events that exceed the capacity of the network finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold distribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations may lead to full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the size of the ""big"" shock is not the problem, as the systemic risk only varies slightly for changes in the number of initially failing agents, the safety margin and the threshold distribution, which further gives hints on how to reduce systemic risk. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cascading dynamics; Systemic risk",,"Schweitzer, F.; Chair of Systems Design, Weinbergstrasse 58, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland; email: fschweitzer@ethz.ch",,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",00224715,,,,"English","J.

We assume to know for all the nodes a non-topological quantity that we interpret as fitness. In contrast, we assume to know the degree, i. e. the number of connections, only for a subset of the nodes in the network. We then use a fitness model, calibrated on the subset of nodes for which degrees are known, in order to generate ensembles of networks. Here, we focus on topological properties that are relevant for processes of contagion and distress propagation in networks, i. e. network density and k-core structure, and we study how well these properties can be estimated as a function of the size of the subset of nodes utilized for the calibration. Finally, we also study how well the resilience to distress propagation in the network can be estimated using our method. We perform a first test on ensembles of synthetic networks generated with the Exponential Random Graph model, which allows to apply common tools from statistical mechanics. We then perform a second test on empirical networks taken from economic and financial contexts.

Complexity science, in contrast, is a theoretically grounded, highly conceptual field searching for more effective and extensive application in practice. This paper explores how these largely separate fields might be better related in enabling groups and organizations cope with uncertainty. It focuses on non-probabilistic scenarios and the so-called Intuitive logics school of scenarios, with its emphasis on plausible, alternative futures because of its increasing dominance. The benefits of incorporating key insights from complexity science into scenario practices seems an obvious 'must have' in engaging complex, messy and puzzling situations and guiding action in the 21st century. Similarly, the persistent and recent significantly increased interest in scenarios offers insights relevant to extending complexity ideas beyond academe and inquiry, into broader spheres of corporate strategy, public policy-making and change management. Plausibility-based scenarios are being deployed to grapple with complexity for a variety of different purposes, including strategic renewal, anticipating systemic risks and enabling the large scale, transitions implied in meeting the challenge of global, sustainable development. This paper suggests that intuitive logics scenarios offer an 'on-ramp' to complexity, encouraging attention to the systemic framing of systems, situations and problems and enabling complexity concepts to penetrate beyond the domains of scholarship. It notes that complexity thinking challenges one-off scenario building practices, especially when the scenarios are developed using the deductive building method. As plausibility-based scenario practices continue to evolve they encounter practical challenges of linking to other processes, relating to other futures methods, broadening beyond the organizational scale, engaging heterogeneous agents and in enabling deeper reframing, exposing deeply held beliefs about progress and assumptions about change management in complex systems.

In particular, they seek to answer the following question: how do we find densely connected subsets of nodes within a credit network? The question is relevant for policy, since these subsets are likely to channel any shock affecting the network. As it turns out, a reliable answer can be obtained with the aid of complex network theory. In particular, the authors show how it is possible to take advantage of the ""community detection"" network literature. The proposed answer entails two subsequent steps. Firstly, the authors verify the hypothesis that the network under study truly has communities. Secondly, they devise a reliable algorithm to find those communities. In order to be sure that a given algorithm works, they test it over a sample of random benchmark networks with known communities. To overcome the limitation of existing benchmarks, the authors introduce a new model and test alternative algorithms, obtaining very good results with an adapted spectral decomposition method. To illustrate this method they provide a community description of the Japanese bank-firm credit network, getting evidence of a strengthening of communities over time and finding support for the well-known Japanese main ""bank"" system. Thus, the authors find comfort both from simulations and from real data on the possibility to apply community detection methods to credit markets. They believe that this method can fruitfully complement the study of contagious defaults. Since network risk depends crucially on community structure, their results suggest that policy maker should identify systemically important communities, i.e. those able extend the initial shock to the entire system. © Author(s) 2013.

Various cell types are involved in this chronic inflammatory pathology in which multiple cellular processes and numerous genes are dysregulated. Systemic risk factors for atherosclerosis are among others adverse blood lipid profiles, enhanced circulating cytokine levels, as well as increased blood pressure. Since many Nuclear Receptors modulate lipid profiles or regulate blood pressure they indirectly affect atherosclerosis. In the present review, we focus on the functional involvement of Nuclear Receptors within the atherosclerotic vessel wall, more specifically on their modulation of cellular functions in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages.

Donor age accepted range is from 1 to 50 years of age, but this can be extended at both ends of the spectrum (from 6 months of age up to 55 to 60-years old) when the donor characteristics are excellent or when the recipient condition is relatively urgent. The selection of donors and the search for fewer risk factors are key when reduction or split techniques are used, since the process of dividing organs is in itself an added risk (trauma and possible prolongation of ischemia). An 'optimal' donor is defined based on age, hemodynamic characteristics and systemic risk factors. In pediatric donors, preference is given to the 'no-touch' technique and aortic-only perfusion for procuring organs from the donor, particularly when the donor is not hemodinamically stable.

On the one hand, Dodd-Frank transforms the U.S. approach to derivatives regulation from a lasses-faire, almost no oversight paradigm into one featuring heavy supervision, supervision focused on the safety and soundness of derivatives markets participants. The commitments to capital and margin requirements, clearinghouses and international cooperation reflect a European vision of financial intermediaries as heavily regulated utilities, rather than the more traditionally American willingness to tolerate the speculative aspects of capital markets. On the other hand, the tools that Dodd-Frank employs to pursue safety and soundness draw inspiration from those that private market actors have employed for centuries. Adopting a more heavily regulated banking paradigm for the formerly (mostly) unregulated derivatives markets, but using market based tools to advance the goals of safety and soundness, might seem like two regulatory reforms working at cross-purposes. However, it may be a sign that real changes in the United States' vision of well-functioning derivatives markets-providing options for sophisticated investors, but not ones laden with hidden systemic risk-are being pursued incrementally, even after comprehensive regulatory reform.",,,"Wharton SchoolUnited States",,,00168076,,,,"English","George Washington Law Rev.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883249926

The other adverse impacts of discretionary buffers would be upsetting growth plans of the industry, caution among investors and effect on banks' asset quality.

This is partly because of the critical role these hitherto overlooked factors played in the run up to the financial crisis, but also because if macroprudential regulation is to achieve its stated stability and growth objectives, it will only do so through unprecedented levels of intervention, thereby elevating the stakes and bringing the politics of regulation centre-stage. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","financial crisis; macroprudential regulation; regulatory politics; systemic risk",,"Mészáros, G.; School of Law, , Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom; email: G.A.Meszaros@warwick.ac.uk",,,17456452,,,,"English","J.

In order to differentiate the effect of bank size from that of systemic importance, we control for systemic risk using the CoVaR measure introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We show that a bank's contribution to systemic risk has a significant negative effect on banks' credit default swap (CDS) spreads, supporting the too-systemic-to-fail hypothesis. Once we control for systemic risk, bank size (relative to gross domestic product (GDP)) has either no or a positive effect on banks' CDS spreads. The effect of bank size increases in the home country's debt ratio and turns positive already at moderate debt ratios. This result is consistent with the too-big-to-save hypothesis. We show further that the effect of systemic risk rises sharply at the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007, but weakens after the failure of Lehman Brothers, reflecting changing bailout expectations. Taken together, our results suggest that banks are not too big to fail, but they may be too systemic to fail and too big to save. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2013.",,"banking; credit provision; debt; risk assessment","Barth, A.; Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany; email: Andreas.Barth@dbb.su.se",,,02664658,,,,"English","Econ.

Methods: An electronic medical record database search was conducted to identify uveitis patients with osteonecrosis and the number at risk for corticosteroid-related osteonecrosis from 2003 to 2012. The clinical and ophthalmologic features of the uveitis patients with osteonecrosis were assessed with retrospective chart reviews. Results: Six uveitis patients with osteonecrosis were identified, comprising a prevalence of 1.5%. The incidence density was 0.19 per 100 person-years of follow-up. The uveitides included sarcoidosis, sympathetic ophthalmia, idiopathic retinal vasculitis, idiopathic chronic anterior and intermediate uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi Harada disease, and Cogan syndrome. The duration of systemic corticosteroid treatment ranged from 6 weeks to 6 years. The potential systemic risk factors were Raynaud phenomenon, antiphospholipid and autoantibodies, sickle cell trait, and thalassemia. Conclusions: Although osteonecrosis appears to be a rare complication among uveitis patients, physicians should strive to minimize systemic corticosteroid use when appropriate. A higher level of suspicion for osteonecrosis may be warranted in patients with additional systemic risk factors. © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Avascular necrosis; Corticosteroid; Osteonecrosis; Prednisone; Uveitis","autoantibody; cyclosporin; methylprednisolone; phospholipid antibody; prednisone; adolescent; adult; article; avascular necrosis; calculation; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical feature; Cogan syndrome; cohort analysis; corticosteroid therapy; drug induced disease; drug megadose; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; female; follow up; hip pain; human; idiopathic disease; incidence; intermediate uveitis; iridocyclitis; knee pain; livedo reticularis; male; medical record review; prevalence; Raynaud phenomenon; retina vasculitis; retrospective study; risk factor; sarcoidosis; sickle cell trait; sympathetic ophthalmia; systemic therapy; thalassemia; treatment duration; uveitis; Vogt Koyanagi syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Osteonecrosis; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; United States; Uveitis; Young Adult","Sen, H.N.; Laboratory of Immunology, 10 Center Dr., 10/10N112, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States; email: senh@nei.nih.gov",,,09273948,,OIINE,"23252656","English","Ocul.

Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks.

However, the association of RVO with genetic predisposition to thrombosis remains poorly understood. The aim of the study was to assess any possible additional effect of genetic predisposition to the already well known 'classical' risk factors of RVO in a cohort of elderly Greek patients. Fifty-one elderly patients with RVO and 51 healthy individuals matched for age and sex were evaluated for systemic risk factors (smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension) and coagulation defects (lupus anticoagulant, natural inhibitors of coagulation). Additionally, genotyping was performed for mutations/polymorphisms involved in haemostasis such as: FV G1691A, FV G4070A, FIIG 20210A, MTHFR C677T and A1298C, PAI-1-675 4G/5G, F XIII exon 2G/T, EPCR A4600G and G4678C.

The prevalence of prothrombotic risk factors was not significantly different in the patients with RVO compared to controls.

Meanwhile, a greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks tends to aggravate the liquidity shortage of a deficit bank. According to comparative analysis between different types of network structures, a core-periphery network with a deficit money center bank gives rise to the highest level of systemic liquidity shortage, and a banking system becomes more vulnerable to liquidity shocks as its interbank network becomes more ill-matched. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Interbank network; Knock-on effect; Liquidity shortage; Systemic risk",,"Lee, S.H.; Bank of Korea, 39, Namdaemun-Ro, Jung-Gu, Seoul 100-794, South Korea; email: leecon@bok.or.kr",,,15723089,,,,"English","J.

By analyzing the trends and fluctuations of daily stock return correlations and default correlations among the 22 largest bank holding companies and investment banks from 1988 to 2008, we find that daily stock return correlation is a simple, robust, forward-looking, and timely systemic risk indicator. There is an increasing trend in stock return correlation among banks, whereas there is no obvious correlation trend among non-banks. We also disaggregate the stock returns into systematic and idiosyncratic components and find that the correlation increases are largely driven by the increases in correlations between banks' idiosyncratic risks, which give rise to increasing systemic risk. Correlation spikes tend to predict or coincide with significant economic or market events, especially during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, we show that stock return correlations offer a perspective on the level of systemic risk in the financial sector that is not already captured by default correlations. Stock return correlations are not subject to data limitations or model specification errors that other potential systemic risk measures may face. Therefore, we recommend that regulators and businesses monitor daily stock return correlations among those large and highly leveraged financial institutions to track the level of systemic risk. © 2012.","Correlation; Stock returns; Systemic risk",,"Patro, D.K.250 E Street SW, Washington, DC 20219, United States; email: dilip.patro@occ.treas.gov",,,15723089,,,,"English","J.

Subsequently, we extend this model into a dynamic simulation model that captures some of the essential characteristics of over-the-counter derivatives markets. Contrarily to the common belief that margining always reduces default risk, we find that there exist situations in which margining increases default risk, reduces aggregate derivatives' trading volume, and has an ambiguous effect on welfare in the banking sector. The negative effects of margining are exacerbated during periods of market stress when margin rates are high and collateral is scarce.

The results from time-varying regression with stochastic volatility estimated using Bayesian inference indicate that the degree of transmission depends significantly on the level of stress, i.e., the intensity of the transmission mechanism itself is given by the magnitude of the shock. Second, the analysis reveals a more complex structure of financial stress linkages between markets on both the domestic and the international level. Finally, the results also support the current findings that the nature of stress is important for the transmission and that the sovereign debt crisis has so far had a limited impact on Czech financial markets.","Financial crises; Financial linkages; Financial stress index; Systemic risk",,"Adam, T.; Czech National Bank, Czech Republic; email: tomas.adam@cnb.cz",,,00151920,,,,"English","Financ.

This paper looks at the assessment of banking sector resilience through stress testing. We argue such analyses are valuable even in emerging economies, which suffer from limited data availability, short time series, and structural breaks. We propose a top-down stress test methodology that employs relatively limited information to overcome this data problem. Moreover, as credit growth in emerging economies tends to be rather volatile, we rely on a dynamic approach projecting key balance sheet items. The application of our proposed stress test framework to the Russian banking sector reveals high sensitivity of the capital adequacy ratio to the economic cycle. This shows up in both of the two-year macroeconomic scenarios considered: a baseline and an adverse one. Both scenarios indicate a need to increase the capital of the Russian banking sector. Furthermore, given that Russia's banking sector is small and fragmented by comparison with advanced economies, a loss of external financing could cause profound economic stress, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Russian state has a low public debt-to-GDP ratio and plays a decisive role in the banking sector. These factors allow sufficient fiscal space for recapitalization of problematic banks under our proposed baseline and adverse scenarios.","Bank; Russia; Stress testing",,"Fungáčová, Z.; Bank of Finland, , Prague, Czech Republic; email: zuzana.fungacova@bof.fi",,,00151920,,,,"English","Financ.

A stock market itself is a system in which there are many sub-systems, like Dowjones, Nifty, Sensex, Nasdaq, Nikkei and other market indices in global perspective. In Indian market, subsystems may be like Sensex, Nifty, BSE200, Bankex, smallcap index, midcap index, S&P CNX 500 and many others.

In such a high dimensional analysis, the graph theory enables us to understand the dynamic behavior of our price system.

But, at the time of writing, a definition of systemic risk that covers all of the factors that precipitated the global financial crisis is still emerging. This paper first describes the debate around the emerging definition(s) of systemic risk and discusses some of the initiatives to address systemic risk by international regulators. These initiatives include microprudential regulations, such as increasing capital for systemically important banks, and macroprudential initiatives, such as the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board. Recognizing that systemic risks arise not only from credit and market risk factors, this paper views systemic risk through the lens of operational risk, arguing that key risk factors, especially people and process risks, were pervasive across the global financial industry prior to the global financial crisis and, consequently, operational risk must be considered as a contributor to, and in some instances a trigger for, systemic risk. The paper goes on to describe the microprudential approach to operational risk within the Basel II regulations and identifies and describes operational risks that were present prior to the global financial crisis. The paper concludes that there is indeed a systemic dimension to operational risk that should be recognized and addressed by banking regulators. Finally, the paper makes some suggestions as to how the management of systemic operational risks may be addressed by banks and regulators. © 2013, Incisive Media Ltd.

Our proposal would require that a small fraction of each MMF shareholder's recent balances, called the ""minimum balance at risk"" (MBR), be available for redemption only with a delay of 30 days. Most regular transactions in the fund would be unaffected; the requirement would only affect redemptions of the shareholder's MBR. In addition, in the rare event that a fund suffers losses, the MBRs of investors who have recently made large redemptions would absorb losses before those of nonredeeming investors. This subordination of redeeming investors' MBRs would create a disincentive to redeem if the fund is likely to have losses, but would have little effect on incentives when the risk of loss is remote.

The applicability of the ROP screening criteria to the Taiwanese population was also examined. Methods: The study included 104 eyes from 54 ROP patients who had BW greater than 1500 g from 1981 to 2008. Demographic information, disease courses, ophthalmic outcomes, and possible systemic risk factors were recorded. The infants were divided into groups of mild and severe ROP for a risk factor analysis. Results: The mean gestational age (GA) of the infants was 31 ± 1.3 weeks, and the mean BW was 1675 ± 249 g. Mild ROP regressed in 94 eyes (90%), and 10 eyes (10%) developed severe ROP. After various treatments, the regression rates for prethreshold or threshold ROP (n = 8) and stage 4 ROP (n = 2) were 100% and 50%, respectively. Forty-eight patients (85%) had at least three associated systemic risk factors. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with an intraventricular hemorrhage were found to have an increased chance of developing severe ROP, especially those with BW greater than 1500 g (p = 0.015). There was also a significant association between patients who had severe ROP and an increased risk of having cerebral palsy (CP) at 1.5 years of age (p = 0.013). Conclusion: The majority of patients with BW greater than 1500 g developed mild ROP.

Our model is an extension of Davis and Lo's infectious default model. We consider an economy of n firms that may default directly or may be infected by other defaulting firms (a domino effect also being possible). Spontaneous defaults without external influence and infection are described by not necessarily independent Bernoulli-type random variables. Moreover, several sources of contamination could be required to infect another firm. In this paper we compute the probability distribution function of the total number of defaults in a dependency context. We also give a simple recursive algorithm to compute this distribution in an exchangeability context. Numerical applications illustrate the impact of exchangeability among direct defaults and among contaminations, on different indicators calculated from the law of the total number of defaults. We then calibrate the model on iTraxx data before and during the crisis. The dynamic feature together with the contagion effect have a significant impact on the model performance, especially during the recent distressed period. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Contagion models; Credit risk; Quantitative finance; Systemic risk",,"Rullière, D.; Université Lyon 1, 50 Avenue Tony Garnier, F-69007 Lyon, France; email: didier.rulliere@univ-lyon1.fr",,,14697688,,,,"English","Quant.

One could say that Dean Curran introduces the concept of 'risk-class' to radicalize the class distribution of risk and charts who will able to occupy areas less exposed to risk and who will have little choice but to occupy areas that are exposed to the brunt of the fact of the risk society. As he mentioned it is important to note that this social structuring of the distribution of bads will be affected not only by class, but also by other forms of social structuration of disadvantage, such as gender and race. In order to demonstrate that the distribution of bads is currently exacerbating class differences in life chances, however, Curran concentrates exclusively on phenomena of individual risks. In the process, he overlooks the problem of systemic risks in relation of the state, science, new corporate roles, management the mass media, law, mobile capital and social movements; at the same time, his conceptual frame of reference does not really thematize the interdependence between individual and systemic risks. Those who reduce the problematic of risk to that of the life chances of individuals are unable to grasp the conflicting social and political logics of risk and class conflicts.

On the other hand, IT better allows banks to exploit economies of scale and scope, which are most evident in transaction banking. Another manifestation of IT is via financial innovations that have enhanced marketability. Stability enters the picture because increased marketability facilitates opportunistic behavior. Together with enhanced herding behavior and changes in industry structure, this could undermine stability and augment systemic risk, calling for a regulatory overhaul. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Banking; Information technology; Relationship banking; Stability; Systemic risk","Commerce; Information systems; Banking industry; Economies of scope; Economy of scale; Financial innovation; Herding behaviors; Industry structures; Relationship banking; Scale and scope; Systemic risks; Technology development; Stability","Marinč, M.; Faculty of Economics, Kardeljeva ploščad 17, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; email: matej.marinc@ef.uni-lj.si",,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",13895753,,,,"English","Electron.

We introduce a small-open-economy extension of the volatility spillover model proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Based on generalised variance decompositions (Pesaran and Shin, 1998) of a vector autoregressive model, this approach combines bidirectional spillovers exchanged by domestic assets with volatility injections imported from shocks to the global financial system. The analysis relates to a sample of daily observations ranging from October 1996 to June 2010. The estimated spillover levels are time-varying, and increase during domestic and foreign crises. Average domestic spillovers of 38% exceed average foreign spillovers of 4.7%, and maximum domestic spillovers estimated for the United States for a similar sample period (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012). These findings suggest a high degree of systemic risk in SA and, furthermore, that this risk is predominantly related to country-specific factors.

Scholars are divided on the merits of clearinghouses; some scholars see them as reducing systemic risk, others contend they increase it. The case for swaps clearinghouses comes down to two related propositions: (1) clearinghouses are better able to manage risk than dealer banks in the over-the-counter derivatives market, and (2) clearinghouses are better able to absorb risk than dealer banks. Both propositions are heavily dependent on the details of clearinghouse design, the structure of the clearinghouse market, and the manner of clearinghouse regulation. In theory, a well-designed clearinghouse boasts one significant advantage over dealer banks: capital. Clearinghouses can have deep capital structures, including callable capital from their members. Clearinghouses thus diffuse losses across their membership, thereby avoiding catastrophic losses to any single institution. If designed properly, a clearinghouse should be much more resilient to losses than an individual dealer bank. Clearinghouse owners, however, are likely to pursue lower capitalization, leaving it up to regulators to ensure sufficient capitalization. Clearinghouses potentially encourage greater risk taking-via underpricing and reduced capital-to gain market share and increase returns on equity. Therefore, because clearinghouses also concentrate risk, they can present a dangerous increase in systemic risk relative to dealer banks. Thus, the case for clearinghouses remains tenuous and ultimately dependent upon the still-to-bedetermined particulars of their regulation. © 2013, Adam J.

The paper also explores features of a constructed bank network using real globe-wide banking data. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Complex system; Epidemic spreading model; Measurement; SV; Systemic risk",,"Feng, X.; College of Finance, , Shanghai 201620, China; email: fxb@sjtu.edu.cn",,,01291831,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a critical analysis. Findings – Regulatory arbitrage has been one of the major factors contributing to the severity of the crisis. Given the ever more complex set of future regulatory constraints, it may keep generating costly negative spillover effects on the whole economy. Moreover, rules-based regulation, however carefully constructed, will unfortunately never prevent bank failures. Neither should it attempt to do so. An effective overall regulatory regime must be sufficiently comprehensive and well-balanced. It must not put too much emphasis on lowering the probability of individual bank failure. The key components of an effective regulatory regime must be: Basel-type rules robust to off-balance-sheet arbitrage; little forbearance in monitoring and supervision by regulatory agencies, with a focus on systemic risk control; automatic and quick intervention as well as resolution mechanisms. While all components are necessary, none is sufficient; and without strong international coordination, none will be effective. Practical implications – Enhanced supervision of banks. Social implications – Less costly bank failures. Originality/value – The paper presents a critical review of current financial reforms in the banking sector. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bank failures; Banks; Basel; Regulation",,"Petitjean, M.; CORE, Belgium; email: mikael.petitjean@uclouvain.be",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13581988,,,,"English","J.

Machines appear to be on the rise and humans on the decline. Human endeavors have become unmanned endeavors. Human thought and human deliberation have been replaced by computerized analysis and mathematical models. Technological advances have made finance faster, larger, more global, more interconnected, and less human. Modern finance is becoming an industry in which the main players are no longer entirely human. Instead, the key players are now cyborgs: part machine, part human. Modern finance is transforming into what this Article calls cyborg finance. This Article offers one of the first broad, descriptive, and normative examinations of this sea change and its wide-ranging effects on law, society, and finance. The Article begins by placing the rise of artificial intelligence and computerization in finance within a larger social context. Next, it explores the evolution and birth of a new investor paradigm in law precipitated by that rise. This Article then identifies and addresses regulatory dangers, challenges, and consequences tied to the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence and computers. Specifically, it warns of emerging financial threats in cyberspace, examines new systemic risks linked to speed and connectivity, studies law's capacity to govern this evolving financial landscape, and explores the growing resource asymmetries in finance.

Materials and methods: The charts of infants with severe ROP treated by diode laser in a tertiary center during the period April 1999 to November 2003 were reviewed. Treated infants were followed up for fundus examination, visual acuity assessment, and cycloplegic refraction. Data regarding ocular risk factors, like zones of ROP and the extent of extraretinal proliferations, and data regarding various systemic risk factors were collected. A minimum follow up of 6 months was needed for inclusion in the study of structural outcome. A minimum follow up of 24 months was needed for the study of visual and refractive outcomes. The outcomes measured were: rate of unfavorable structural outcome, unfavorable visual outcome (visual acuity, <20/40), and high myopia (myopia ≥ 5 diopters). The ocular and systemic risk factors were studied for their significance in the development of unfavorable outcomes. Results: Two hundred seventy eyes of 148 infants were treated for severe ROP, out of which 20 eyes (7.4%) had unfavorable structural outcome. Visual data were available for 149 eyes of 81 infants, of which 70 eyes (47%) had unfavorable visual outcome. Refractive data were available for 131 eyes of 72 infants, and high myopia was present in 23 (17.6%) eyes. Zone I disease was the significant risk factor for unfavorable structural (P< 0.0001), unfavorable visual outcome (P = 0.03), and for high myopia (P< 0.0001). Lower postconceptional age at treatment was significant for unfavorable structural outcome (P = 0.03) and high myopia (P< 0.0001). Presence of sepsis (P = 0.029) and extraretinal proliferation ≥ 6 hours were significant for unfavorable structural outcome (P = 0.002). Conclusion: ROP in zone I was the most significant risk factor for all the unfavorable outcomes.

Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study included adults aged 40-80 years from the non-institutionalized population of the Yazd district, in 2010-2011. Using multi-stage, systematic cluster random sampling and a probability proportional to size strategy, 58 clusters of 40 subjects were selected from 251 clusters in different enumeration areas. A detailed interview and eye examination were performed for each eligible participant. The eye examination included refraction testing, uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity testing, slit lamp biomicroscopy, Goldmann applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, dilated fundus examination, visual field, determination of central corneal thickness, and stereoscopic fundus photography. General health assessments and laboratory tests including hemoglobin, hematocrit, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, serum lipids, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio were also performed to assess anthropometric and systemic risk factors. Results: Of 2320 eligible individuals, 2098 (response rate 90.4%) participated in the study. The mean ± standard deviation age of participants was 54.1 ± 10.0 years, and included 994 men (47.4%) and 1104 women (52.6%). Most participants lived in urban regions (89.2%) and were younger than 60 years old (72.0%). Among the participants, 20.1% were illiterate, and 40.9%, 28.0%, and 11.0% had primary, secondary and college or university level education, respectively.

First, regulatory institutions are often systematically understaffed and do not have the resources needed to adequately process whistle-blowing cases. Second, regulators who process whistle-blowing cases are often systematically inexperienced and do not understand the strategic importance of whistle-blowing cases. Third, regulators are often under systemic pressure from the politicians who appoint them to ignore whistle-blowing cases relevant to their sources of financial and/or ideological political support. Fourth, there are high systemic risks to whistle-blowers who blow the whistle to regulatory institutions. Nonetheless, understanding how the institutions and obstacles operate can help us understand what types of whistle-blowing methods can be used to navigate around the obstacles and within the regulatory institutions.

This paper makes a positive, politico-economic argument. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners.

I argue that we have reached a state of economic development where creativity is a productive force, and imagination is the human activity that propels creativity. The market, I suggest, has become the projective screen for our imaginative capacities. But at the same time, the market itself creates systemic risks that require the exercise of authority and the subordination of imagination to rules and regulations. The result is a tension between imagination and authority. When poorly managed, this tension leads to crises. The chapter is divided into eight sections. In the first, I argue that the 2007-8 financial crisis was less the result of imprudent decisions and more the result of what are called ‘systemic risks’. In the second, I link the idea of systemic risk to what we call within the system psychodynamics tradition, ‘the group as a whole’ and the problem of authority. In the third, I suggest that markets are attractive to the mind not because they are rational but because we project onto them our capacity to imagine. I suggest this is so because increasingly imagination has become a ‘productive force’ in the economy. In the fourth section, I suggest that imagination as a psychic function integrates what Freud (1911) called the pleasure and reality principles, and that this integration takes psychological work to sustain. It is therefore prone to break down into one or the other of its constituent parts. When the pleasure principle wins out, the culture takes on a narcissistic color, and the sense of entitlement replaces the respect for authority. I suggest that the behavior of some bank and financial-firm executives and their employees reflected this sense of entitlement. In the fifth section, I argue that in our valuing of imagination, we therefore risk succumbing to the pleasure principle, which brings us into conflict with the authority system we need to manage systemic risks. But the authority system’s legitimacy is based on the useful work accomplished by the reality principle. Authority expresses the important idea that we must keep our narcissism and impulses in check in order to participate productively in the social world. We experience a conflict between the reality and the pleasure principles instead of their integration in imagination. In the sixth section, I explore the learning from two innovations that William Halton introduced to the Group Relations conference: the resource planning and marketplace events. I show how members’ experience in these events suggests that as imagination is broken up into its constituent parts, the reality principle and the pleasure principle each become social defenses for the other. In the seventh section, I suggest that we replace the idea of social psychology with the idea of psychosociology, a term our French colleagues use, because, increasingly, social and political conflicts are the result of the projections of our mind onto society. The meaning of the classic tension between markets and central planning has been transformed. In the final section, I summarize my argument. © 2012 Susan Long and Burkard Sievers.",,,"Hirschhorn, L.United States",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136666681; 9780415600316,,,"English","Towards a Socioanalysis of Money, Finance and Capitalism: Beneath the Surface of the Financial Industry",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123652632

The surge in quantity, quality and diversity of financial market participants, instruments and procedures, as well as of resources, is indeed remarkable. Numerous studies have shown that, over time, financial development has been increasingly driven by two major factors: innovation and globalization. A wave of financial innovations has helped multiply the volume of available funding. Simultaneously, the process of globalizing the financial markets has progressed at an extraordinary space. It has been fueled by factors of different natures, such as the IT revolution, capital account liberalization, deregulation of financial sectors and cross-national expansion of huge financial institutions. Financial development feeds into the macroeconomic performance of individual countries and of the global economy. There is broad agreement that financial stability is desirable for economic growth. In particular, international financial stability is perceived as a non-rival, non-excludable public good (Kanbur 2002). As such, it should be pursued by all stakeholders with an interest in maintaining it, as a lack of stability entails undesirable costs for them. The issue of which system is the most conducive to the achievement of international financial stability as well as for reaping benefits to economic growth from financial development is, however, more debatable. One view being advocated is that international financial stability is, by and large, achieved via a system of competitive financial markets, which provides an adequate environment for independent policies of actors such as sovereigns and profit-maximizing investors. Such a framework helps avoid excess volatilities and positively affects growth. The concept of an efficient market can be traced back to the work of Samuelson (1965). A market-clearing mechanism appears to be instrumental to the efficiency of allocation. Within that approach, financial innovations and financial globalization are regarded as important facilitators of economic growth. Under the market system, incentives for innovations, such as profit-maximizing or risk-optimizing behavior, are strong. New and improved financial products, procedures and institutions pave the way for the expansion of economic activity by facilitating the process of trading and risk-pooling, by raising the percentage of savings available for investment, and by improving the allocation of capital and producing higher total factor productivity (McKinnon 1973; Levine 1997). These positive effects are enhanced when financial innovations are allowed to work worldwide. Free financial movements are considered fundamentally sound. An improved diversification of risk and better allocation of capital are beneficial not only to growth, but also to the stability of consumption (Fischer 1998; Summers 2000; Henry 2007). A contrasting view rests on the assumption of imperfect and inefficient markets. Inefficiency is attributed to such distorting factors as information asymmetries, herding behavior or principal-agent problems (Greenwald and Stiglitz 1986). Both financial innovations and financial globalization are producing and channeling considerable risks for the stability of the international financial system. In particular, the synchronized and simultaneous behavior of large fractions of market participants within the global financial network multiplies the effects of single decisions and leads to a systemic risk of excessive price volatilities. New financial products are complex and not well understood by all market participants, thereby reducing transparency and contributing to the underpricing of risk (Dorrucci and McKay 2011). Securitization and sales of products to distant investors bring about a weakening of lending standards. Fast profitseeking and innovative financial institutions attempt to lower their costs and, therefore, expand activities into the least regulated environment. It is further recognized that financial globalization is aggravating risks by producing cross-border externalities and spreading them worldwide. These developments activate and fuel the process of financial contagion across the globe. It is therefore argued that the system of free global financial markets tends to produce excessive volatilities when markets switch from euphoria to excessive pessimism which cannot be appropriately priced through a pattern of the risk premium and returns (Griffith-Jones 2003). In particular, international financial flows may not result in the equalizing of currency-adjusted and risk-adjusted rates of return everywhere. Abrupt, market-led adjustments undermine the stability of the international financial system. In small open economies different causes of financial stress are usually translated into problems in the balance of payments. This refers to both external factors, such as terms of trade shocks or sudden reversals of capital flows, and domestic factors, which include excessive budget financing needs or run-on deposits. External shocks are more likely to lead to balance of payments tensions in economies with non-reserve currencies, even if sound policies are pursued. However, large fiscal deficits and the accumulation of domestic debt may also add to external debt which is further increased by the usually depreciating currency. Recent decades have seen many balance of payments crisis episodes in emerging economies, from Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s, through East Asia, Russia and Brazil in the 1990s to Argentina, Turkey, Ecuador, Nigeria, Venezuela and several European economies over the 2000s. Increasing reversals in international capital flows have posed persistent risk to external balances in emerging economies. Some of these crises have ended as sovereign defaults. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, however, some advanced economies, particularly from the Eurozone periphery, were also affected by serious sovereign external problems. Financial imbalances tend to expand, usually at high speed, across sectors and countries. In 2007 the crisis in the local financial subsector initiated developments that have diffused externally, creating, over time, fears of a global currency war. The view challenging the efficiency of financial markets calls for an inevitable and active policy involvement required to address the balance of payment crisis. Financial contagion, which is speeding up and producing many considerable externalities, may create problems which cannot be dealt with exclusively by individual countries. Approaching international financial stability as a global public good implies, therefore, that coordinated, international actions are more effective than the market mechanism as instruments of response to a financial crisis. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Andreas Pyka and Hans-Peter Burghof.",,,"Wilczynski, R.; Warsaw University of Finance and ManagementPoland",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781135084912; 9780415696852,,,"English","Innovation and Finance",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121891564

Evaluation of systemic risk is based on a detailed financial analysis of the insurance industry, its role in the economy, and the interconnectedness of insurers. The primary conclusion is that the core activities of US insurers do not pose systemic risk. However, life insurers are vulnerable to intra-sector crises; and both life and property-casualty insurers are vulnerable to reinsurance crises arising from counterparty credit risk. Noncore activities such as financial guarantees and derivatives trading may cause systemic risk, and interconnectedness among financial institutions has grown significantly in recent years. To reduce systemic risk from noncore activities, regulators need to continue efforts to strengthen mechanisms for insurance group supervision, particularly for multinational groups. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

The featuring of deposit insurance along with subordinate debt incentivizes banks to choose lower asset correlations among themselves as their respective optimal strategies.

Governments increasingly seek to maximise the benefits of globalisation for national populations by eliminating unnecessary regulatory divergences and barriers, and ensuring greater co-ordination of regulatory objectives. At the same time, intensification of global challenges, such as those pertaining to systemic risks (financial markets), the environment (air or water pollution), and human health and safety, is leading to growing regulatory co-operation efforts as a key component of risk management strategies across borders. Regulatory co-operation is not a new topic (OECD, 1994). However, renewed attention has been paid to its importance since the economic crisis began in 2008. Perceived regulatory failures related to poor articulation of regulation across borders, limited enforcement of rules and regulatory capture have raised questions regarding the role of the state as a regulator and, specifically, how and where it should intervene to achieve key policy objectives in an increasingly globalised world. The gains that can be achieved through greater co-ordination of rules and their application across jurisdictions remain largely untapped and underanalysed. Consensus has grown among countries over the years on the elements of ""good"" regulation at domestic level, culminating in 2012 with Council's approval of the Recommendation on Regulatory Policy and Governance. By contrast, the potential of international regulatory cooperation (IRC) to transfer good regulatory practices, to make markets function better, to level the playing field, to reduce costs, to manage global goods and risks better and to generate substantial benefits for business and the public has not been explored systematically. Despite its potential and the fact that the OECD and others have accumulated a large body of experience in fostering regulatory co-operation in a number of specific areas, including environment, competition, consumer protection and tax, this vast body of (mostly qualitative) knowledge has yet to be synthesised and analysed to provide useful lessons. This report is a unique attempt to gather in a synthetic but systematic manner, the knowledge and evidence available to date on IRC. This report reviews the available evidence on IRC drawn from a literature review, a survey to OECD countries and case studies of specific IRC experiences and lays the foundation for further work on IRC. Chapter 1 systematically defines and documents a wide range of IRC mechanisms and highlights a number of prevailing trends in the internationalisation of regulation, laying the foundation for the development of a typology. Chapter 2 reviews the benefits, challenges and costs of IRC and highlights the critical conditions of success, laying the foundations for the development of a checklist to support governments' efforts in identifying adequate forms of IRC in a specific context and in developing and strengthening successful co-operation. The areas where further work is needed are elaborated upon in the conclusion. The review of evidence confirms the increased internationalisation of regulation, which takes place through a wide variety of IRC mechanisms and multiple actors. Today, governments use and combine a broad range of formal and informal, broad and specific IRC mechanisms to achieve their co-operation objectives. In a given policy area, there can be different forms of IRC. The strengthening of IRC is accompanied by a multiplication of state and non-state actors with regulatory powers, i.e. different levels of government and public agencies and private national and international stakeholders. As a result, countries are embedded in webs of regulatory cooperation that go beyond the traditional treaty-based model of international relations, to encompass transgovernmental networks involving multiple actors with sometimes limited oversight or monitoring by the centre of government. To keep pace with the need to regulate across borders, the nature of IRC has changed from complete ""harmonisation"" of regulation (i.e. uniformity of laws) to more flexible options - such as mutual recognition agreements. This shift is partly due to the recognition that frictions generated by regulatory divergences result as much from diverging enforcement and implementation efforts as from differences in the regulations and standards themselves. Consequently, harmonisation of rules will address only one aspect of regulatory divergences. The understanding that regulatory co-operation needs to encompass all phases of the policy cycle is growing and with it the recognition that flexible mechanisms need to be put in place to address implementation challenges and to anticipate forthcoming issues. In this context, soft law and informal co-operation - such as dialogue between regulators and exchange of information - Are becoming more important in promoting regulatory co-operation, generally in support or in anticipation of more binding processes, and as a flexible tool to address emerging global issues. Similarly, the trend is towards the development of supporting international organisations that provide a platform for continuous discussions. Despite growing regulatory co-operation, decision making on IRC remains mainly guided by political considerations and is not informed by a clear understanding of benefits, costs and success factors of the diverse IRC options. In some areas, co-operation has led to obvious successes. Experience accumulated in chemical safety, for example, shows that the use of harmonised approaches and instruments leads to important savings for governments and industries, while allowing greater achievement of public policy objectives. Most cases of successful co-operation have, however, tended to develop in an ad hoc manner, along ""paths of least resistance"", and without following general principles of good regulatory governance. There is no overall and cross-country consensus yet on the language used in relation to IRC, or on the range and definition of the different mechanisms in the hands of policy makers to promote IRC. The quantitative evidence on the benefits and costs of IRC remains scant. Changing language and anecdotal evidence generate uncertainty with regards to the benefits and costs of regulatory co-operation and prevent systematic and rational decision making on IRC. The shortcomings and gaps in policy making related to IRC call for further analytical work and guidance for which the OECD Regulatory Policy Committee is well positioned to provide useful inputs. While most countries acknowledge the importance and potential value of IRC, very few have started considering and mainstreaming issues of international co-operation into their regulatory process. More could be done in support of country efforts to identify the range of existing IRC mechanisms, to assess the benefits, costs and challenges of IRC in specific sectors and situations, and to strengthen IRC following good regulatory policy principles. Similarly, the emergence of new actors with regulatory powers on the international scene has been mostly spontaneous, and has not necessarily been matched with corresponding good regulatory practices. As an example, while transnational private regulation plays a growing role, governments have limited systematic tools at their disposal to evaluate when and under which conditions transnational private regulation might be a preferable regulatory option. Similarly, while international organisations play a growing role in supporting IRC, the extent to which they do so while following good regulatory policy practices is unclear. © OECD 2013.",,,,,"Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)",,9789264200463; 9789264200463,,,"English","Intl.

Some argued that governments should act to fundamentally restructure the financial sector. Large banks should be broken up. Investment and commercial banks should be separated as they had been under the Glass-Steagall reforms of the 1930s (or at least the investment activity of commercial banks should be drastically restricted). Limits on the types of financial products that could be marketed and taxes on financial transactions were promoted. Opponents of government intervention positioned themselves at the opposite position. They argued that a government-led reconstruction of the financial marketplace would be counterproductive, if not futile. Such actions would impede financial innovation and restrict credit and liquidity. At most, according to this view, reform should get the taxpayer off the hook for the failure of financial firms. The middle ground in this debate was held by those who argued that the basic structure of the financial sector should remain intact but that the capacity and powers of regulatory agencies should be enhanced to better monitor the sector for systemic risks, financial fraud, and predatory lending practices. The middle ground, reflected in the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, appears to have won out. © The Tobin Project 2014.",,,"McCarty, N.; Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International AffairsUnited States",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139565875; 9781107036086,,,"English","Preventing Regulatory Capture: Special Interest Influence and How to Limit it",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928048469

Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the Western world and nearly the leading cause in other developing countries, is associated with systemic risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia (Malek et al., 1999a). Nonetheless, it is clearly a focal disease with atherosclerotic lesions forming in the coronary arteries, major branches of the aortic arch, and the abdominal aorta. Plaque formation preferentially involves the outer walls of vessel bifurcations and points of blood flow recirculation, where hemodynamic shear stress is weaker than in unaffected areas. Detailed analysis of fluid mechanics in these areas revealed a strong spatial correlation between endothelial dysfunction/plaque formation and low mean shear stress and oscillatory flow with recirculation (Nerem, 1992; Malek et al., 1999a). It has been suggested that low mean shear stress and nonlaminar flow stimulate the formation of an atherogenic phenotype (Gibson et al., 1993; Ku et al., 1985) while arterial level shear stress (≥15 dynes/cm2) stimulates atheroprotective gene expression profile and cellular responses that are essential for normal endothelial function (Harrison, 2005; Cunningham and Gotlieb, 2005), implying that the maintenance of physiological, laminar shear stress on endothelial cells is crucial for normal vascular function (Traub and Berk, 1998). The development of atherogenesis can be studied at various levels; however, the origins of the disease have been linked to mechanosensing by a number of studies (Ku et al., 1985; Glagov et al., 1988; Svindland, 1983; Debakey et al., 1985; White et al., 2003), suggesting that investigations at the molecular level are required for further understanding of the atherogenesis. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,"Blood vessels; Developing countries; Elasticity; Endothelial cells; Fluid mechanics; Gene expression; Physiological models; Proteins; Shear flow; Shear stress; Stresses; Atherosclerotic lesions; Endothelial dysfunction; Endothelial function; G protein coupled receptors; Gene expression profiles; Laminar shear stress; Mechanotransduction; Spatial correlations; Aluminum alloys","Zhang, Y.-L.; La Jolla Bioengineering InstituteUnited States",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139195874; 9780521895231,,,"English","Cellular Mechanotransduction: Diverse Perspectives from Molecules to Tissues",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923396540

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act aims to reduce systemic risk inherent in this market, which exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis, by imposing various requirements upon market participants, including margin requirements on uncleared OTC derivatives. Margin requirements protect against potential losses from counterparty default by requiring parties to exchange payments as collateral for their obligations under a derivative contract. Yet because much of the OTC market consists of cross-border transactions, which implicate multiple regulatory regimes, inadequate coordination with other jurisdictions could lead to regulatory arbitrage, gaps or conflicts and undermine the goals of this regulatory requirement. Moreover, the extraterritoriality provisions of Title VII, as analyzed in light of recent case law, indicate that the jurisdictional scope of Dodd-Frank's margin requirements may be ambiguous and uneven. To avoid the dangers of inconsistent regulatory standards, minimize legal uncertainty and reduce systemic risk in the OTC derivatives market, foreign and domestic regulators should strive for application of comparable domestic margin regimes to cross-border uncleared OTC derivatives contracts in the context of mutual recognition.

As reflected by the size of the market, they have become popular among both retail and institutional investors. The original ETFs were simple and easy to understand; however, recent products, such as leveraged, inverse, and synthetic ETFs, are more complex and have additional dimensions of risk. The additional risks, complexity, and reduced transparency have resulted in heightened attention by regulators. This chapter aims to increase understanding of how ETFs function in the market and can potentially impact financial stability and market volatility. Design/methodology/approach - We discuss the evolution of ETFs, growing regulatory concerns, and the various responses to these concerns. Findings - We find that concerns related to systemic risk and excess volatility, suitability for retail investors, lack of transparency and liquidity, securities lending and counterparty exposure are being addressed by both market participants and policy makers. There has been a shift toward multiple counterparties, overcollateralization, disclosure of collateral holdings and index holdings. Originality/value - The analysis contained in this chapter provides an understanding of the role of ETFs in the financial markets and the global economy that should be valuable to market participants, investors, and policy makers.

Recent trends; increased competition, technological advances, structural changes, globalization, all had their share of impact on governance systems of capital markets institutions particularly on exchanges. Corporate governance of non-financial firms and capital markets institutions differ in several ways. Firstly the role of risk management differs since they may impose systemic risks to the financial system. Secondly well-implemented governance structures and processes are required but are not sufficient in capital markets since there are several conflicts of interests to be addressed. Therefore whether and how effectively they function is what matters. Thirdly the governance structures of such institutions exhibit different effectiveness on their decisions. The governance of FIs in capital markets is discussed in terms of board structure and management, risk governance, supervisors, shareholders, executive compensation, role of regulators, authorities and values and culture. The role of stock exchanges in corporate governance are discussed separately in terms of implementing corporate governance codes, demutualisation and its impact on regulations, transparency and accountability issues and the effects of M&As among exchanges. Market needs strong analytical tools and reliable benchmarks to assess governance risk. The corporate control and the regulation of the institutions by the exchanges when the corporations (regulated) are the competitors of the exchanges (regulators) or owned by the stockholders of the exchanges must be addressed. The risk of regulatory arbitrage, calls for the need of harmonisation among regulators. Better regulation of FIs and greater global coordination among regulators are seen as the most two important issues to prevent another crisis.

In this regard, the subprime mortgage crisis (SMC) shook the foundations of the financial industry by causing the failure of many iconic Wall Street investment banks and prominent depository institutions. This crisis stymied credit extension to households and businesses thus creating credit crunches and, ultimately, a global recession. This book specifically discusses the SMC and its components, causes, consequences and cures in relation to subprime loan extension and securitization, risk and regret, data as well as bank bailouts. In particular, the SMC has highlighted the fact that risk, credit ratings, profit and valuation as well as capital regulation are important banking considerations. With regard to risk, the book discusses credit (including counterparty), market (including interest rate, basis, prepayment, liquidity and price), tranching (including maturity mismatch and synthetic), operational and systemic risks. The book introduces the IDIOM hypothesis that postulates that the SMC was largely caused by the intricacy and design of subprime loan extension and securitization that led to information problems (dispersion and asymmetry), opaqueness and ineffective risk mitigation. It also contains appropriate examples, discussions, timelines as well as appendices about the main results on the aforementioned topics. Numerous references point to the material not covered in the book, and indicate some avenues for further research. In order to understand the key results a working knowledge of discrete-time stochastic modeling and optimization is required. The book is one of the first to approach the SMC from a mainly theoretical- rather than a numerical-quantitative or qualitative viewpoint. It is primarily intended for financial industry role players, researchers as well as students and staff at academic institutions. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

For this retrospective consecutive case series, microbiologic and clinical records were reviewed to identify all patients with intraocular culture-proven endogenous fungal endophthalmitis treated at a single institution between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2011. Results: Sixty-seven eyes of 53 patients were identified; 51 eyes of 39 patients had positive cultures for yeast and 16 eyes of 14 patients had positive cultures for molds. Patients with molds as a causative organism had significantly shorter duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (molds 3.8 days, yeast 21.0 days, p = 0.002), were more likely to be receiving iatrogenic immunosuppression (molds 57.1%, yeast 7.7%, p = 0.001), have a history of whole-organ transplantation (molds 35.7%, yeast 2.6%, p = 0.001), and were more likely to have hypopyon at the time of diagnosis (molds 37.5%, yeast 6.0%, p = 0.001). Patients with endogenous endophthalmitis caused by molds had significantly worse visual acuity at the time of diagnosis (logMAR visual acuity molds 1.80, yeast 1.15, p = 0.008) and at final visit (logMAR visual acuity molds 1.97, yeast 1.05, p = 0.005) compared to those patients with yeast as a causative organism. There was no significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment between the two groups (mold 12.5%, yeast 30.6%, p = 0.201). Patients with cultures positive for mold were significantly more likely to undergo enucleation (molds 25.0%, yeast 0%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Systemic risk factors for patients with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis caused by molds were iatrogenic immunosuppression and a history of whole-organ transplantation. Shorter duration of symptoms before diagnosis and higher rates of hypopyon occurred in mold cases. While endogenous fungal endophthalmitis is generally associated with poor visual acuity outcomes, infection with mold species was associated with worse visual acuity on presentation and on final follow-up than infection with yeast species. Enucleation rates were much higher in mold cases. © 2013 Sridhar et al.","Aspergillus; Candida; Fungal eye infections; Infectious endophthalmitis","adolescent; adult; aged; article; Aspergillus fumigatus; Aspergillus niger; Aspergillus terreus; Candida albicans; Candida tropicalis; child; Cladophialophora; Cladophialophora devriessi; clinical feature; controlled study; Cryptococcus neoformans; disease duration; enucleation; Eurotium herbariorum; fungal endophthalmitis; Fusarium oxysporum; human; infant; major clinical study; middle aged; organ transplantation; preschool child; priority journal; retina detachment; risk factor; school child; treatment outcome; very elderly; visual acuity; young adult","Sridhar, J.; Department of Ophthalmology, , Miami, FL 33136, United States; email: jsridhar@med.miami.edu",,"Springer Verlag",18695760,,,,"English","J.

This paper develops a model of real estate pricing based on rational behaviour with two regimes. In 'normal times' prices of housing units are determined by the consumers who live in them and are equal to the discounted stream of housing services. In 'boom and bust times' speculators find it profitable to borrow from banks and enter the market. There is an agency problem because banks are unable to fully assess the risk that the speculators are taking and this leads to risk shifting and asset substitution. The result is a bubble in real estate prices in that they are higher than the discounted stream of housing services during the boom phase. This model is then used as the basis for analysing macro-prudential polices designed to prevent the occurrence of such bubbles. These measures include monetary policy, fiscal tools such as real estate transfer taxes, and annual real estate taxes and banking regulation such as restrictions on loan-to-value ratios, countercyclical capital requirements and loan provisions.

As hypothesized, we find that firms with higher institutional ownership provide more informative disclosure on distinct risk factors and take more actions in response to the risk factors.

Although acutely glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, chronic glucocorticoid excess worsens atherosclerosis, possibly by exacerbating systemic cardiovascular risk factors. However, glucocorticoid action within the lesion may reduce neointimal proliferation and inflammation. Glucocorticoid levels within cells do not necessarily reflect circulating levels due to pre-receptor metabolism by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs). 11β-HSD2 converts active glucocorticoids into inert 11-keto forms. 11β-HSD1 catalyses the reverse reaction, regenerating active glucocorticoids. 11β-HSD2-deficiency/inhibition causes hypertension, whereas deficiency/inhibition of 11β-HSD1 generates a cardioprotective lipid profile and improves glycemic control. Importantly, 11β-HSD1-deficiency/inhibition is atheroprotective, whereas 11β-HSD2-deficiency accelerates atherosclerosis. These effects are largely independent of systemic risk factors, reflecting modulation of glucocorticoid action and inflammation within the vasculature. Here, we consider whether evidence linking the 11β-HSDs to vascular inflammation suggests these isozymes are potential therapeutic targets in vascular injury and atherosclerosis.",,"11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; glucocorticoid; atherosclerosis; drug antagonism; enzymology; human; immunology; metabolism; neointima; physiology; review; vasculitis; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2; Atherosclerosis; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Neointima; Vasculitis","Hadoke, P.W.email: Patrick.Hadoke@ed.ac.uk",,,15346242,,,"23512604","English","Curr Atheroscler Rep",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883688466

This paper explores how much of these movements in the spreads of Asian economies reflected shifts in global risk aversion or country-specific risks, directly from worsening fundamentals, or indirectly from spillovers originating in other sovereigns, or risks and uncertainty surrounding their exchange rates. This analysis finds that earlier in the crisis, the increase in market-implied contagion led to an increase of sovereign bond yields relative to the swaps. Higher-rated sovereign bonds in Asia benefited from the flight to quality that accompanied the increase in global risk aversion during this period. Once the systemic risks in the financial sectors worldwide were contained, the risk of sovereign spillovers eased, which, together with a fall in perceived currency-related risks, led to a fall in sovereign bond yields relative to swaps yields across the board. Comparing the situation to that of Europe, the present paper concludes that the debt crisis in the euro area has not affected the perception of sovereign risks of Asian economies. In fact, a fall in exchange rate and spillover risks, combined with stronger fundamentals, have led to a continued normalization of Asian sovereign spreads since the height of the financial crisis. © 2013 East Asian Economic Association and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

To describe a reproducible method of quantifying macular hard exudates (HEs) in diabetic maculopathy and determine the associations of HEs with systemic risk factors. Methods. Patients with diabetes were recruited from a tertiary eye hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Total macular area covered by HEs (total HE area) and the distance from the foveal center to the nearest HE were measured in a semi-automated manner. Associations between HE parameters and diabetic complication risk factors were examined using multiple linear regression models. Results. Of 593 participants (mean age 60.5-years old), 97 (16.4%) had HEs in at least one eye, due to diabetic maculopathy. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for inter and intra-observer agreements were 0.982 and 0.999, respectively. Total HE area was positively associated with qualitative HE severity scale determined by photographic graders. The median of total HE area was 0.089 mm2 (interquartile range, 0.027-0.246). The median distance between foveal center and the nearest HE was 791.1 μm (431.9-1385.4). After adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin, mean arterial pressure, diabetic retinopathy level, and use of lipid-lowering medication, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = 0.009), and triglyceride levels (P = 0.036) were positively associated with total HE area. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with central involvement (P = 0.023). Conclusions. Quantitative measurement of HEs in patients with diabetes is associated with lipid levels, and higher triglyceride levels are associated with a higher risk of central involvement. Quantitative information may be useful to monitor HE progression or treatment response in persons with diabetic maculopathy. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.","Diabetes; Diabetic macular edema; Hard exudate; Quantitative measurement; Serum lipid","hemoglobin A1c; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; article; diabetes mellitus; diabetic macular edema; disease severity; exudate; female; human; laser coagulation; macular thickness; major clinical study; male; microalbuminuria; observer variation; optical coherence tomography; priority journal; questionnaire; reproducibility; retina fovea; retina maculopathy; risk factor","Wang, J.

NASH is a progressive liver disease that increases the risk of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Interestingly, the global health risk of NAFLD is not confined to the liver. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD exhibit not only increased liver-related complications and liver-related mortality but also increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, increased risk of post-operative complications after major liver surgery, and increased risk of developing certain malignancies, including primary liver cancer and colorectal cancer. In this review, we discuss the current evidence linking NAFLD with the risk of CVD in the setting of the more complex scenario of other hepatic and extra-hepatic complications that may occur during the natural course of NAFLD. Moreover, we provide a brief description of the putative biological mechanisms underlying such complications, particular emphasis being given to CVD. We conclude that NAFLD is a complex health problem with implications far beyond the liver. Hence, it may cause a significant global health burden and the assistance of patients with NAFLD impacts on the work of physicians from many different medical specialties. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Atherosclerosis; Cholangiocarcinoma; Chronic kidney disease; Cirrhosis; Colorectal cancer; HCC; Mortality; NAFLD; NASH; Natural history; Type 2 diabetes","article; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; bile duct carcinoma; cancer risk; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; chronic kidney disease; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; diabetogenesis; disease course; health hazard; hepatitis; hepatobiliary system cancer; human; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; liver transplantation; mortality; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; postoperative complication; priority journal","Sookoian, S.; Instituto de Investigaciones Médicas A.

In particular, Swiss franc (CHF)-denominated loans, popular in Eastern European countries, could trigger simultaneous bank failures if depreciation of the domestic currencies prevents unhedged borrowers from servicing the loans. Foreign currency loans thus pose a systemic risk from a ""common market shock"" perspective. The author uses a novel dataset of foreign-currency loans from 17 countries for 2007-11 (collected by the Swiss National Bank) and builds on the method suggested by Ranciere, Tornell, and Vamvakidis (2010) to quantify this systemic risk. The author finds that systemic risk is substantial in the non-euro area, while it is relatively low in the euro area. However, CHF-denominated loans are not the underlying source of the high systemic risk: Loans denominated in other foreign currencies (probably to a large extent in euros) contribute significantly more to the systemic risk in the non-euro area than CHFdenominated loans. Furthermore, systemic risk shows high persistence and low volatility during the sample period. The author also finds that banks in Europe have continuously held more foreign-currencydenominated assets than liabilities, indicating their awareness of the exchange-rate-induced credit risk they face. © 2013, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",,,"Yeşin, P.; Swiss National Bank, Germany",,"Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis",00149187,,,,"English","Fed.

It is widely recognised that a system-oriented approach is needed to effectively manage risks in complex and mission critical systems. Well-known standard approaches to risk management exist and some frameworks and best practices have reached a high level of completeness and suitability in the different possible application scenarios. Nonetheless, we realised that poor support is offered towards the adoption of system-oriented approaches to risk management. This paper proposes a web-based application, named systemic risk management (SYRMA), to effectively support a system approach to risk management, especially in the case of complex and mission critical systems. SYRMA is based on a conceptual model that identifies main entities in risk management and their relations with resources of the target organisation. Identified relationships among model entities facilitate the provision of a synoptic overview of incidents, possible risks and risk-related information. Finally, we describe how SYRMA has been implemented as a prototype for the healthcare sector.

The undiversifiable risk appearing in specific market sectors is called systematic risk rather than systemic risk. The paper focuses on global banking stocks comprising global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs), and discusses the global systematic risk measurement. To forecast future joint distribution of returns, the authors utilize the multivariate autoregressive moving average generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) model with the multivariate normal tempered stable (MNTS) distributed and multivariate normal distributed innovations. This work statistically demonstrates that the ARMA-GARCH model with the MNTS distributed innovations is a more realistic model for G-SIFI stocks. In line with previous studies, the authors estimate four systematic risk measures: joint probability and conditional probability of negative stock return movements, ΔCoVaR, and ΔCoAVaR. It is found that the joint probability of negative movements is a good indicator for a significant increase in systematic risk. Subsequently, the authors investigate the relationship among the other three measures and find the following. Crosssectional linkages between AVaR and ΔCoAVaR are few, if any, but there is a strong time series linkage. On the other hand, the conditional probability of negative movements and ΔCoAVaR show similar cross-sectional magnitude relations, though their time series linkage is not clear. Thus, both AVaR and conditional probability of negative movements reinforce each other and serve a useful reference for ΔCoAVaR-based systematic risk measurement. © Authors, 2013.","ARMA-GARCH model; CoAVaR; CoVaR; G-SIFIs; Global banking stock markets; Multivariate normal tempered stable distribution; Systematic risk measurement",,,,"LLC CPC Business Perspectives",18104967,,,,"English","Investm.

Patients and methods: We conducted a monocentric retrospective study from January 2005 to January 2011, identifying and collecting data from inpatients admitted for severe documented bacterial keratitis. Results: We found 268 unilateral corneal ulcers. At least one local or systemic risk factor was identified in 255/268 patients (95%). The leading risk factor was contact lens wear (129/268), followed by underlying corneal disease (50/268) and prior corneal surgery (47/268). Initial and final visual acuities were 0.06 and 0.2 (1.20 and 0.72 LogMAR) respectively. Contact lens wear was associated with better prognosis and shorter hospitalization (P < 0.05). Corneal healing was obtained in 255/268 patients (95%), with adjuvant surgery for 33 patients. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Gram+ cocci, more commonly associated with degenerative keratopathy or prior corneal surgery, and Gram- bacilli, more commonly associated with contact lenses (P < 0.05). Both demonstrated a similar prognosis. Conclusion: Specific risk factors should be investigated in cases of severe bacterial keratitis. Contact lens wear is the most frequent risk factor, but with a better prognosis than underlying corneal disease, prior corneal surgery or systemic risk factors. The specific bacterial pathogen no longer appears to dramatically influence the outcome of severe corneal ulcers. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.","Bacterial keratitis; Contact lens; Corneal abscess; Corneal ulcer; Microbiology; Outcome; Risk factors","adult; aged; article; bacterial eye infection; cohort analysis; disease course; emergency health service; female; hospital department; hospitalization; human; keratitis; male; middle aged; ophthalmology; patient referral; retrospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistics; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Emergency Service, Hospital; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Female; Hospital Departments; Hospitalization; Humans; Keratitis; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","Dethorey, G.; Unité d'Ophtalmologie, 1, place du Parvis-Notre-Dame, 75004 Paris, France; email: geoffrey.dethorey@gmail.com",,,01815512,,JFOPD,"23017327","French","J.

In this article, we construct a network model according to the debt-credit relations instead of using the conventional methodology to measure the default risk. Based on the model, a risk index is examined using the quarterly report of consolidated foreign claims from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and debt/GDP ratios among these reporting countries. The empirical results show that this index can help the regulators and practitioners not only to determine the status of interconnectivity but also to point out the degree of the sovereign debt default risk.

We compute the index for 10 European countries, exploiting the information incorporated in the CDS premia of 44 large banks over the period January 2007-September 2010. In this way, we provide a market based measure of the liability incurred by the Governments, due to the implicit bail-out guarantees they provide to the financial sector. We find that during the financial crisis the systemic component of the default risk in the banking sector has significantly increased in all countries, with the exception of Germany and the Netherlands. As a consequence, the Governments' liability implicit in the bail out guarantee amounts to a quite relevant share of GDP in several countries: it is huge for Ireland, lower but still important for the other PIIGS (Italy is the least affected within this group) and for the UK. Finally, our estimate is very close to the overall amount of money already committed in the rescue plans adopted in Europe between October 2008 and March 2010, despite strong cross-country differences: in particular, Germany and Ireland seem to have committed an amount of resources much larger than needed; to the contrary, the Italian Government has committed much less than it should. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Financial crisis; Government budget; Systemic risk",,"Baglioni, A.; Catholic University of Milan, Largo Gemelli, n. 1, 20123 Milano, Italy; email: angelo.baglioni@unicatt.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",02615606,,,,"English","J.

We empirically test the model with 2007 US commercial banks balance sheet data and compare the model prediction of the failed banks with the real failed banks after 2007. We find that our model efficiently identifies a significant portion of the actual failed banks reported by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Background: Despite studies demonstrating slowing of disease progression within epicardial coronaries with risk factor modification, little is known about the natural history and clinical sequelae of atherosclerosis progression within the LMCA. Methods: In 340 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease who underwent serial intravascular ultrasound imaging to evaluate the effects of anti atherosclerotic therapies across 7 clinical trials, LMCA and epicardial disease progression was characterized. Relationships between changes in plaque burden with remodeling parameters and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (death, myocardial infarction, hospital stay for unstable angina, and coronary revascularization) were investigated. Results: Plaque regression was observed in the LMCA segment, and progression was observed in adjacent epicardial segments (percent atheroma volume [PAV] -0.39 ± 0.1% vs. +0.37 ± 0.1%, p &lt; 0.001). Changes in LMCA lumen volume correlated strongly with changes in external elastic membrane (beta coefficient 0.91, p &lt; 0.001) and negatively with the change in PAV (beta coefficient -0.55, p &lt; 0.001). Patients who experienced a MACE had smaller baseline LMCA minimum lumen area (11.6 vs. 12.2 mm2, p = 0.05) and greater progression of PAV in the LMCA (+0.51 ± 0.3% vs. -0.35 ± 0.2%, p = 0.02) compared with those who were MACE-free. Significant reductions from baseline in both external elastic membrane (-4.7 ± 1.7 mm3, p &lt; 0.01) and lumen volumes (-4.0 ± 1 mm3, p &lt; 0.01) were also observed in those having an event. Conclusions: Left main coronary atherosclerosis responds to systemic risk factor modification. Patients experiencing a MACE were more likely to demonstrate progressive disease and constrictive arterial remodeling within the LMCA segment. © 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation.","arterial remodeling; atherosclerosis progression; intravascular ultrasound; left main disease","acetylsalicylic acid; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; artery diameter; article; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; clinical trial (topic); coronary artery atherosclerosis; disease association; disease course; female; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; hospitalization; human; image analysis; intravascular ultrasound; left coronary artery; left main coronary atherosclerosis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk reduction; unstable angina pectoris; Aged; Angina, Unstable; Chi-Square Distribution; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Disease Progression; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Revascularization; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography, Interventional","Nicholls, S.J.; Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44195, United States; email: stephen.nicholls@sahmri.com",,,19368798,,,"23347860","English","JACC Cardiovasc.

Apparition and evolution of periodontal diseases are influenced by many local or systemic risk factors. Psychological stress has been suggested as one of them and may negatively influence the outcome of periodontal treatment. However, mechanisms explaining the possible relationship between stress and increased susceptibility to periodontal disease remain poorly understood. Several stress markers are found in blood and saliva of patients with periodontal diseases and influence the development of periodontal diseases by several mechanisms including modifications of the inflammatory response and changes in the composition of the dental biofilm.

Therefore, we can appraise the co-movements of the four previous financial markets as well as the joint behavior of their respective volatilities (i.e. systemic risk). Moreover, the resulting conditional variance and covariance metrics allow for handling volatility spillovers (i.e. contagion risk in terms of transmitting volatility shocks from one market place to another market place). Indeed, results highlight the unprecedented high systemic risk levels (i.e. joint increased volatility levels) as well as a high contagion risk (i.e. volatility spillover) during the subprime mortgage market crisis. The transmission process of volatility shocks reveals to be simultaneous across financial markets due to a strong arbitrage activity and electronic trading practices among others. Most importantly, the estimated conditional correlations exhibit an upward sloping trend, which underlines an increase in the correlation risk between financial markets in the late nineties or early 2000. Thus, our major findings are twofold. First, we characterize the dynamic correlation risk across financial markets. Second, we also confirm the increasing and nonlinear trend in the correlation risk, which we are able to quantify. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Conditional correlation; Contagion risk; Leverage effect; Multivariate BEKK; Nonparametric regression; Systematic risk; Systemic risk; Volatility spillover",,"Gatfaoui, H.; Rouen Business School, 1 Rue du Maréchal Juin, BP215, 76825 Mont-Saint-Aignan Cedex, France; email: hayette.gatfaoui@rouenbs.fr",,,02649993,,,,"English","Econ.

In addition, we develop optimal portfolio strategies and investment proportions for conventional and Islamic funds to ensure the best resource allocation.

To understand the relationship between business cycles and cascades of bankruptcies, we model a three-sector economy with goods, credit and interbank market. In the interbank market, the participating banks share the risk of bad debits, which may potentially spread a bank's liquidity problems through the network of banks. Our agent-based model sheds light on the correlation between bankruptcy cascades and the endogenous economic cycle of booms and recessions. It also demonstrates the serious trade-off between, on the one hand, reducing risks of individual banks by sharing them and, on the other hand, creating systemic risks through credit-related interlinkages of banks.

Objectives: To estimate prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment and to describe its relationship with demographic and systemic risk factors including diagnosed diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized population. In 1999-2002 and 2005-2008, 9471 and 10 480 participants aged 20 years or older received questionnaires, laboratory tests, and physical examinations. Visual acuity of less than 20/40 aided by autorefractor was classified as nonrefractive visual impairment. Main Outcome Measure: Nonrefractive visual impairment. Results: Weighted prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment increased 21% among US adults aged 20 years and older from 1.4% in 1999-2002 to 1.7% in 2005-2008 (P=.03); and increased 40% among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.5% to 0.7% (P=.008). In multivariable analyses, statistically significant risk factors for nonrefractive visual impairment in 1999-2002 included age (per year odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09), poverty (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.31-3.64), lack of insurance (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.16-2.95), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.15-3.25). In 2005-2008, risk factors included age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.07), poverty (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.55-3.22), education less than high school (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.54-2.90), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.64-4.37). Prevalence of diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis increased 22% overall from 2.8% to 3.6% (P=.02); and 133% among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.3% to 0.7% (P<.001). Conclusion: Prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment was significantly higher in 2005-2008 than in 1999-2002 and may be attributable, in part, to higher prevalence of diabetes, an associated risk factor that increased in prevalence during this time period. ©2012 American Medical Association.

We demonstrate path-dependences of myopic evolutionary approaches, the infeasibility of straightforward ""trial-and-error"" processes, and the need for adequate long-term policy assistance. We also show why increasing returns and uncertainties radically offset the rationale for postponed investments in new technologies and how stochastic models cope with systemic risks implicitly induced by interdependencies among uncertainties, technologies, the structure of models, and decisions.

The methodology foresees defining and associating utility functions to these controllers and elaborating a global utility function (as an aggregated function of local utilities) for the overall network.

The novelty of the approach is to estimate a figure for counterparty credit risk (CCR) grouping together most of the financial transactions that generate counterparty risk and to analyze the benefit of netting possibilities in reducing the overall risk exposure, using three different scenarios. In the first scenario, counterparty credit risk is calculated assuming that no close-out netting is possible across different contracts. The second scenario assumes bilateral negotiations and netting across contracts. The third scenario contemplates the existence of a central counterparty as the center of transactions. Benefits from netting and central counterparty are assessed by comparing the risk exposure in each scenario. Results from the model show that netting provides a decrease in world counterparty risk of over $17 trillion. Netting is thus a powerful tool available in the world markets to manage counterparty risk while decreasing systemic risk, and as such policies to facilitate and standardize netting procedures across different jurisdictions should be encouraged. Moreover, results show that the use of central counterparties for settling the outstanding contracts would additionally decrease CCR by over $2 trillion. © 2012, Virtus Interpress.

Most serious economists would agree with the core propositions put forth by the contributors to this volume. The economy is stuck in a prolonged period of deflation that is characteristic of the aftermath of a severe financial collapse. The collapse, in turn, was caused by a combination of destructive financial “innovation” and regulatory corruption. The largest banking institutions, having escaped the salutary constraints of the New Deal era, failed at their role of assessing risk and allocating credit. Instead, they behaved like hedge funds, operating at extremely high leverage ratios, creating and trading opaque securities that added nothing to economic efficiency, and hugely profiting at the expense of the real economy. All of this intensified systemic risk and inflated a series of asset bubbles. When the bubbles popped, an immense unwinding occurred, leaving the economy in a prolonged slump. The period we are in is popularly termed “The Great Recession,” but it has more of the characteristics of a depression. © Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy 2013.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139059589; 9781107015890,,,"English","After the Great Recess.: The Struggle for Economic Recovery and Growth",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924213551

Banks and other financial institutions channel the economy's savings toward a variety of current productive uses. By borrowing short-term and lending long-term, these institutions create a flow of credit that passes liquidity from savers to investors, and transforms liquid short-run assets into less liquid long-term assets. But lending in credit markets requires confidence in the borrowers' ability to repay the debt (principal and interest) in full and on schedule. The current turmoil in U.S. financial markets is the result of a breakdown in that necessary confidence. In an environment of distrust, financial institutions are far less willing and able to lend long-term. This book examines the monetary policy and macro-economic supply factors in U.S. credit markets that contributed to the credit expansion.

For example, the establishment of a conservatorship for the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in September 2008 potentially triggered credit default swap contracts with notional value exceeding $1.2 trillion.

The relaxation of competition policy would be the wrong policy response in times of economic crisis since competition policy can play an important role in bringing the crisis economy back on track.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) began a process to address this lack of federal oversight by creating the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Treasury Department. Before the crisis, state regulation of insurance was sharply criticized for its lack of uniformity, its inefficiency, and the impediments that it posed for developing international insurance norms. In the wake of the financial crisis, questions have also been raised about whether state insurance regulation was equipped to deal with the potential systemic risks posed by the insurance firms, like American Insurance Group, Inc. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that begin to tackle each of these issues, primarily through the creation of FIO. This Article will look at the creation of FIO and the role that FIO is playing to address the systemic risks posed by insurance and insurance-like products and firms and the development of insurance norms. This Article will also examine the arguments raised by many within the insurance industry that greater federal oversight of insurance is unnecessary because the state regulation already provided adequate solvency protections, insurance companies do not pose the types of systemic risks posed by banks and investment firms, and market discipline is stronger in the insurance industry than in the banking industry.",,,"Brown, E.F.; Department of Risk Management and Insurance, United States; email: ebrown49@gsu.edu",,,00096881,,,,"English","Univ.

This distorting effect is the main theme of the Austrian capital-based theory of the trade cycle. But interest rates pushed below the natural rate can have another serious damaging effect. They can distort the appreciation of risk. Austrian economists have claimed that interest rates include a risk premium in addition to valuing future over present consumption. It follows that interest rates below the natural rate can create an unwarranted bullishness that leads to systemic ""appraisal optimism."" Error prone ""marginal entrepreneurs"" receive resources which would not have been available to them in ordinary circumstances. This mistaken optimism leads to reductions in precautionary assets or ""reserve assets"" (to use Ludwig Lachmann's term), which businesses hold against untoward events. The reduction in precautionary assets helps explain how production is possible above the sustainable production frontier (SPF) for lengthy periods during the boom. The quantity of precautionary assets also explains to what degree businessmen select projects which are risky or time consuming. For any given interest rate, the quantity of precautionary assets determines whether businessmen will make more risky or more time consuming investments.","ABCT; Appraisal optimism; Boom; Business cycle; Bust; Contraction; Credit expansion; Crisis; Depression; Precautionary assets; Recession; Systemic risk",,"Miller, R.

Multitude of concepts in complexity engineering has been contextually developed in a wide range of disciplines by from scientists who are interested in bio-inspired methods and working in computer science or mobile robots, or they come from the area of systems engineering. A very fundamental need in complexity engineering is a general and well-developed methodology, set of design rules, and patterns for engineering 'manageable' and 'value robust' system architectures. The engineering of the Systemic Financial Risk Infrastructure Systems (SRITS) has notable resisted the application of the traditional system engineering approaches. SRITS is a complex adaptive system in the manner described by complexity science. The paper briefly presented a conceptual framework called CXLUD capable of dealing with the challenges posed by complex adaptive system, i.e. understanding, visualizing, designing, describing, managing and designing the future. The framework provides a means for system designers and managers to organize systems information in ways that allow for better collection, understanding and analysis of system information during early-phase conceptual design of complex systems. The paper summarizes the results from a series of design procedure case studies at one of the largest financial institutions in UK working on developing a complex systemic risk infrastructure projects to which the introduced decision making or way of thinking framework were applied. © 2012 IEEE.","complex adaptive systems; complexity science; enterprise modeling; framework; system architecture; systemic risk; value robustness","Complex adaptive systems; Complexity science; Enterprise modeling; framework; System architectures; Systemic risks; Conceptual design; Engineering; Systems engineering; Adaptive systems","Amaechi, A.; School of Information Systems, Computing and Mathematics, , Uxbridge, Middlesex, UB8 3PH, United Kingdom; email: austin.amaechi@brunel.ac.uk",,,,9781467347662,,,"English","Proc.

We find no evidence that hedge funds systematically benefit from opportunistic trading. In contrast, some funds operating with strategies that commonly utilize leverage (e.g., f ixed income arbitrage and event-driven strategies) perform significantly worse than would be expected given ex ante risk-factor loadings. This suggests that forced liquidations probably caused some funds to sell into a falling market at fire-sale prices. However, underperformance is not concentrated in specific funds that use leverage or during the height of the systemic risks in September 2008, indicating that selling pressure likely derives from meeting redemptions versus forced selling during the crisis.

This is a key question for Western military organizations after the Iraq War and its consequences. All human crises are manmade because of we are human beings. The spreading of individual risk also increases systemic risk. The root cause of the problem is what has been termed ""rational irrationality"" - behavior that, on the individual level, is perfectly reasonable but that, when aggregated in a complex system, produces calamity (Alpaslan & Mitroff 2010, xvii). From the perspective of organizational adaptation and learning, March (1991) argues that a significant number of competencies needs to be learnt and unlearnt during each and every process of change. According to Birkinshaw and Gibson (2011, 2004), in many sports, ambidexterity is a competitive advantage. Footballers are encouraged to use both left and right foot; left-handed batsmen have a slight advantage against right handed bowlers; the southpaw boxer presents a rarely encountered challenge to a boxer with an orthodox stance; some ambidextrous tennis players even use both hands, separately, to play strokes during a rally. And while some individuals are naturally twohanded or two-footed, many work hard to gain an advantage by practising until they master ambidexterity. The challenge for public security and safety organizations is that with terrorism and changes brought on by cybersecurity they are faced with their greatest challenge since the end of World War Two. Not only are the structures and operating procedures undergoing change but also attitudes and values are pressed on by a changing society. Rational black and white thinking no longer functions when immigrants, various ethnic backgrounds, social media and the operating mechanisms and values of market economy force their way into the training grounds of military bases and battlefields. This article examines the usefulness of the concept of ambidexterity as part of the Comprehensive Approach planning and decision-making process adopted by Western military organizations.","Ambidexterity; Comprehensive approach (CA); Planning process","Ambidexterity; Competitive advantage; Comprehensive approach (CA); Cyber security; Decision making process; Human being; Individual risks; Iraq War; Market economies; Military organizations; Military planning; Operating mechanism; Organizational adaptation; Planning process; Public security; Right handed; Root cause; Safety organizations; Social media; Tennis players; Twohanded; World war; Competition; Military operations; Societies and institutions; SportS; Rational functions","Huhtinen, A.-M.; Finnish National Defence University, Helsinki, Finland; email: aki.huhtinen@mil.fi",,,,9781622765379,,,"English","Eur.

Financial regulators from economies around the world have responded to the crisis by proposing new, internationally uniform bank liquidity standards, augmenting the existing Basel Capital Accord.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that endogenous glucocorticoids influence neointimal proliferation; this may be mediated by effects on systemic risk factors or locally in vessels and modulated by either adrenal secretion or enzymes expressed in vessels that mediate local inactivation [11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (11β-HSD2) in endothelium] or regeneration [11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (11β-HSD1) insmoothmuscle] of glucocorticoids. Femoral artery wire angioplastywas conducted in C57BL/6J, Apo-E-/-, 11β-HSD1-/-, Apo-E, 11β-HSD1-/- (double knockout), and 11β-HSD2-/- mice after glucocorticoid administration, adrenalectomy, glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, or selective 11β-HSD1 inhibition. In C57BL/6J mice, neointimal proliferation was reduced by systemic or local glucocorticoid administration, unaffected by adrenalectomy, reduced by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone, and increased by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486. 11β-HSD2 deletion had no effect on neointimal proliferation, with or without eplerenone. 11β-HSD1 inhibition or deletion had no effect in chow-fed C57BL/6J mice but reduced neointimal proliferation in Apo-E-/- mice on Western diet. Reductions in neointimal size were accompanied by reduced macrophage and increased collagen content. We conclude that pharmacological administration of glucocorticoid receptor agonists or of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may be useful in reducing neointimal proliferation. Endogenous corticosteroids induce beneficial glucocorticoid receptor activation and adverse mineralocorticoid receptor activation. However, manipulation of glucocorticoid metabolism has beneficial effects only in mice with exaggerated systemic risk factors, suggesting effects mediated primarily in liver and adipose rather than intravascular glucocorticoid signaling. Reducing glucocorticoid action with 11β-HSD1 inhibitors that are being developed for type 2 diabetes appears not to risk enhanced neointimal proliferation.

The paper illustrates that if uncertainty arises about a large government's ability to raise taxes to repay its debt, then a debt-financed bailout which initially restores bank health may inadvertently contribute to the financial system's ultimate demise if banks are important lenders to a foreign country that pegs its currency to the domestic money. © 2012 Copyright Korea International Economic Association.","Bank bailouts; fixed exchange rates; insolvency",,"Miller, V.; UQAM, Montreal, Canada; email: miller.victoria@uqam.ca",,,10168737,,,,"English","Int.

This paper describes some initial considerations for building an integrated modeling and analysis environment to aid in assessing complex financial data. The modeling environment is engineered to support execution of quantitative models including agent based and network models against equivalent scenarios of economic conditions. The environment provides tools to compare and visualize model outputs, and to allow decision makers to maintain traceability from model outputs back to their underlying assumptions.

It also examines the approach taken by the Malta Financial Services Authority in order to address these challenges. Originality/value – Possible future challenges that might arise in view of CRD IV are also considered.

Major failures in the financial markets can now occur at super-human speeds, as was witnessed in the ""Flash Crash"" of May 6 th 2010. Events such as the Flash Crash may become more commonplace in future, unless lessons are learned from other fields where complex adaptive socio-technical systems-of-systems have to be engineered for high-integrity, safety-critical applications. In this document we review the literature on failures in risky technology and high-integrity approaches to safety-critical SoS engineering. We conclude with an argument that, in the specific case of the global financial markets, there is an urgent need to develop major national strategic modeling and predictive simulation capabilities, comparable to national-scale meteorological monitoring and modeling capabilities. The intent here is not to predict the price-movements of particular financial instruments or asset classes, but rather to provide test-rigs for principled evaluation of systemic risk, estimating probability density functions over spaces of possible outcomes, and thereby identifying potentially high-consequence failure modes in the simulations, before they occur in real life, by which time it is typically too late. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","algorithmic trading; financial markets; flash crash; high-frequency trading; Large-scale complex IT systems; normalization of deviance; ultra-large-scale systems","Algorithmic trading; Financial market; flash crash; High frequency HF; IT system; Normalization of deviance; Commerce; Finance; Large scale systems; Probability density function; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Information technology","Cliff, D.; UK Large Scale Complex IT System Initiative, , Bristol BS8 1UB, United Kingdom; email: dc@cs.bris.ac.uk",,,03029743,9783642340581,,,"English","Lect.

For example: What role do large banks play in systemic risk? How should capital adequacy standards recognize this role? How is stability shaped by concentration and diversification in the financial system? We explore these questions using a deliberately simplified, dynamic model of a banking system that combines three different channels for direct transmission of contagion from one bank to another: liquidity hoarding, asset price contagion, and the propagation of defaults via counterparty credit risk. Importantly, we also introduce a mechanism for capturing how swings in ""confidence"" in the system may contribute to instability. Our results highlight that the importance of relatively large, well-connected banks in system stability scales more than proportionately with their size: the impact of their collapse arises not only from their connectivity, but also from their effect on confidence in the system. Imposing tougher capital requirements on larger banks than smaller ones can thus enhance the resilience of the system. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in more concentrated systems, and continue to apply, even when allowing for potential diversification benefits that may be realized by larger banks. We discuss some tentative implications for policy, as well as conceptual analogies in ecosystem stability and in the control of infectious diseases.",,"article; capital; financial information system; health care cost; priority journal; Economics; Financial Management; Models, Economic","Arinaminpathy, N.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, , Princeton, NJ 08540, United States; email: nimpathy@princeton.edu",,,00278424,,PNASA,"23091020","English","Proc.

It presents a linear production model where a banking industry is introduced and argues that changes in the size of the financial industry can change the distributive shares even if the rates of profit and wage remain constant. An increase in the new loans to workers can increase the profit share and reduce the wage share through an increase in effective demand and the level of production. The analysis can support the contention that the process of financial deregulation, with the consequent explosion of the financial system and the rise of systemic risk, is at the basis of the increase in income inequality observed in recent years. © The Author 2012.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 32 children with PVT in accompaniment at Hospital das Clínicas of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais from January 1990 to July 2011. Laboratory evaluation of thrombophilias was performed from September 2010 to July 2011. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were evaluated; 59% were boys. Median age at diagnosis was 2.4 years. Mean time of patients' accompaniment was between 4.7 and 5.2 years. The presence of hereditary and acquired thrombophilias occurred in 34.4% of patients, and 9 of them also showed other risk factors in the previous history evaluation. Risk factors were absent in the previous history of 18 patients (56.3%). Two patients showed persistent high titres of anticardiolipin antibodies. Hyperhomocysteinemia was not observed. One patient was heterozygous for factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation (3.1%). Eleven patients (34.4%) showed heterozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, and no patient had the JAK2V617F mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Even after investigation of main hereditary and acquired thrombophilia, PVT remains without apparent cause in most patients. Nevertheless, association of local and systemic risk factors seems to be important also in the pediatric age group. Therefore, despite the low prevalence, a complete investigation, which includes both hereditary and acquired thrombophilias, may be necessary.

In this research, taking Taiwan stock market as an example and collecting data from 2000 to 2010 which contained the 2001 dot-com bubble and the 2007-2009 financial crisis, we adopt the CoVaR model to empirically explore the impact of sector-specific idiosyncratic risk on the systemic risk of the system and attempt to investigate the links between financial crises, systemic risk and the idiosyncratic risk of a sector-specific anomaly. The result showed sector-specific marginal CoVaR, i.e., ΔCoVaR, perfectly explained Taiwan stock market disturbance during the 2001 dot-com bubble and 2007-2008 financial crisis. Thus, by identifying the larger ΔCoVaR sectors, i.e. the systemic importance sectors, and by exploring the risk indicators, independent variables, of these systemic importance sectors, investors could practically employ the sector-specific ΔCoVaR measure to deepen the systemic risk scrutiny from a macro into a micro prudential perspective. © 2012 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","Conditional VaR; financial crisis; idiosyncratic risk; spill over; systemic importance; systemic risk; value at risk",,"Cheng, C.-L.; Institute of Business and Management, No. 118 Chung-Hsiao W.

During this debate, adolescent and adult women may seek these products online. Due to safety concerns, including potential counterfeit forms, we wished to assess whether online no prescription contraceptives were available. Study Design: We assessed online availability of reversible, prescription contraceptive methods resulting in < 10 undesired pregnancies/year, i.e., Depo-Provera shot; oral contraceptives; NuvaRing; Ortho Evra patch; Paragard and Mirena IUDs; and Implanon/Nexplanon implants. Using Google search buy ITEM no prescription, we reviewed the first five result pages for no prescription vendors. Searches were conducted 1/3/2012-2/20/2012. Results: All contraceptives were available as no prescription products. Furthermore, IUDs were advertised as over-the-counter and YouTube videos provided how to videos, including a cartoon version. We also found that illicit online pharmacy marketing is shifting from direct search engine access to social media (Facebook, Twitter, Slidehare, flickr). Conclusion: Online contraceptive sales represent patient safety risks and a parallel system of high-risk product access absent professional guidance.

Despite its longstanding efforts to promote better cooperation among prudential banking supervisors, the crisis has confirmed that individual supervisors ignore the impact of their decisions on financial stability in other jurisdictions. It has also highlighted the systemic risks host supervisors whose financial systems are dominated by foreign banks face. Many of these risks originate from the numerous incentive distortions between home and host supervisors. International bodies such as the G20, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee have responded in a concerted effort and publicly promoted better cooperation, particularly through the use of supervisory colleges and the establishment of cross-border crisis management groups. However, improving supervisory cooperation alone is not sufficient. What is needed is a rigorous analysis to ensure the right incentives for home and host supervisors are in place at every stage of the supervision and resolution process.

To minimize the displacement in the securities market that a major bankruptcy in the industry can cause, the Code creates a safe harbor from avoidance actions that could otherwise claw back transfers completed prior to bankruptcy; this is known as the ""stockbroker safe harbor"". To redress securities fraud, however, the Code exempts from the stockbroker safe harbor those avoidance actions brought to claw back fraudulent transfers completed prior to bankruptcy. But this exemption is incomplete such that the stockbroker safe harbor shelters fraudulent transfers made by a Ponzi scheme before a certain point in time. As a result, early investors in a Ponzi scheme retain ""profits"" at the expense of later investors, who rarely recover their principal investments. Courts have attempted to exclude Ponzi scheme transfers from the protection of the stockbroker safe harbor provision by narrowly interpreting its terms and by holding that Congress did not intend for the provision to apply to Ponzi scheme transfers. This Note argues that each of these judicial approaches is inadequate and suggests other methods of excluding Ponzi scheme transfers from the protection of the stockbroker safe harbor.",,,"Rothschild, S.

Following this idea, the purpose of this research is to reinforce a comparative study on small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) handling both risk and crisis management according to a new tailored model of a balance scorecard (BS). This new model of risk and crisis management aims at improving both SMEs' management adaptation and performance across all of crisis' stages, something not attempted so far in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: The application of such a BS comes from the author's experience as a banker financing various SMEs industries, as a bank consultant on risk management, yet primarily from the results of a survey performed on a set of Romanian and Cypriot SMEs, equal-proportionally selected from the area of trading, manufacturing, and services. The data regard the period 12/2008-06/2011 as representative for the latest global financial crisis affecting the entire European Union region, too. Findings: Coincidently or not, this study's results show a significant improvement of the financial performance of the SMEs who employed this model compared to those who did not.

Our bank-by-bank framework uses balance-sheet data plus high-frequency market data in a way that measures risk exposures and can capture key risk transmission and feedbacks with the sovereign in real time. Risk transmission between banks and sovereigns can arise in the framework from several important sources: (a) bank holdings of risky sovereign debt, (b) explicit and implicit guarantees from sovereigns to banks, and (c) spillovers from sovereign spreads into bank borrowing costs. We illustrate the framework with several examples and ways forward to analyze multicountry sovereign and banking interactions.

In federal securities regulation, the EMH has offered a theoretical construct to accompany the general belief in the value of accurate and complete information that has animated the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since its creation. Specific applications of the EMH have been straightforward and predictable: For instance, its tenets as to market processing of public information helped motivate the streamlining of procedural requirements as to corporate disclosures and, more controversially, as to private securities class action lawsuits. In state corporate law, the EMH has influenced developments as to takeovers and the corporate objective. In contrast, the EMH and related learning have failed to sufficiently inform governmental actions to address financial illiteracy. Belief in the EMH and the value of efficient markets has weakened in the face of recent market anomalies and stress. The May 2010 flash crash is not easily reconciled with the EMH, and related phenomena such as high frequency trading involve an equity market microstructure far different from the microstructure at the time the EMH emerged. Actions motivated by the global financial crisis (GFC), such as the SEC short-selling ban in September 2008, arguably suggest a greater willingness to subordinate market efficiency in favor of other governmental goals. A range of important EMH-related issues loom beyond those associated with financial illiteracy, the equity market microstructure, and governmental goals. Foremost are those relating to the informational predicate on which market efficiency rests. One key aspect of the informational predicate relates to the disclosure challenges associated with financial innovations (such as asset-backed securities) and business entities heavily involved in financial innovation activities (such as certain money center banks). The quotintermediary depiction modelquot that the SEC has always used is inadequate in financial innovation-related contexts. Another key aspect relates to the massive amounts of information that the Dodd-Frank Act requires to be provided to governmental bodies.

Patients and Methods: To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional antidiabetic pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control). Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum glucose level >180 mg/dL on <2 occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled. Results: The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-peptide ratio (I/C) > 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas metformin and/or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS. In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age < 60 years (P =.0002), I/C < 0.175 (P =.0016), and average glucose level < 180 mg/dL (P =.0236). Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age < 60 years (P =.0008), I/C < 0.175 (P =.0002), high systemic risk (P =.0173) and average glucose level < 180 mg/dL (P =.0249). I/C < 0.175 was the only significant (P =.0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration. Conclusions: A glargine-plus-aspart intensive insulin regimen did not improve ALL outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia. Exogenous insulin may be associated with poor outcomes, whereas metformin and thiazolidinediones may be associated with improved outcomes. Analysis of these results suggests that the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy may influence ALL outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Diabetes; Intensive insulin regimen; Metformin; Secretagogues; Thiazolidinediones","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; C peptide; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; dexamethasone; doxorubicin; glucose; insulin aspart; insulin glargine; metformin; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; vincristine; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; adult; aged; article; Burkitt lymphoma; cancer regression; cancer risk; cancer survival; controlled study; drug megadose; female; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; lymphoblastoma; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; outcome assessment; overall survival; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial; secondary analysis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Blood Glucose; Burkitt Lymphoma; C-Peptide; Cyclophosphamide; Dexamethasone; Disease-Free Survival; Doxorubicin; Female; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin, Long-Acting; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Thiazolidinediones; Treatment Outcome; Vincristine; Young Adult","Yeung, S.-C.J.; Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, United States; email: syeung@mdanderson.org",,,21522650,,,"22658895","English","Clin.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with <5 visual field tests during follow-up were included. Progression was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis, defined as the same 3 or more visual field locations with a slope more negative than -1.0 dB/year at P < 5%, on 3 consecutive tests. Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model. Results: A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7 ± 10.9 years; mean follow-up, 40.6 ± 12 months) were analyzed. Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine (mean rates of progression, -0.38 ± 0.9 vs 0.02 ± 0.7 dB/y, P <.01). In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates, older age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.41/decade older, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.90, P =.022), use of systemic antihypertensives (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.32 to 4.87, P =.005), and mean ocular perfusion pressure (HR = 1.21/mm Hg lower, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.31, P <.001) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect (HR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.55, P <.001). Conclusions: While randomization to brimonidine 0.2% was protective compared to timolol 0.5%, lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study. This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms. The current results and large number of drop-outs in the brimonidine 0.2% arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,"antihypertensive agent; brimonidine; timolol; timolol maleate; adult; aged; article; bleeding; blood pressure fluctuation; cohort analysis; confidence interval; conjunctiva disease; controlled study; disease course; double blind procedure; drowsiness; eye allergy; fatigue; female; human; hyperemia; linear regression analysis; low tension glaucoma; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; perfusion pressure; perimetry; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; systolic blood pressure; treatment outcome; visual field; xerostomia; Administration, Topical; Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Aged; Disease Progression; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gonioscopy; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Low Tension Glaucoma; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmic Solutions; Prospective Studies; Quinoxalines; Risk Factors; Timolol; Vision Disorders; Visual Acuity; Visual Field Tests; Visual Fields","De Moraes, C.G.; Einhorn Clinical Research Center, 310 East 14th St, New York, NY 10003, United States; email: demoraesmd@gmail.com",,,00029394,,AJOPA,"22835512","English","Am.

We define macroprudential capital requirements as the fixed point at which each bank's capital requirement equals its contribution to the risk of the system under the proposed capital requirements. We use a network based structural model to measure systemic risk and how it changes with bank capital and allocate risk to individual banks based on five risk allocation mechanisms used in the literature. Using a sample of Canadian banks we find that macroprudential capital allocations can differ by as much as 25% from observed capital levels, are not trivially related to bank size or individual bank default probability, increase in interbank assets, and differ substantially from a simple risk attribution analysis. We further find that across all risk allocation mechanisms macroprudential capital requirements reduce the default probabilities of individual banks as well as the probability of a systemic crisis by about 25%. Macroprudential capital requirements are robust to model risk and are positively correlated to future capital raised by banks as well as future losses in equity value.

While the results show that restrictions on a bank's leverage ratio and the imposition of liquidity requirements, as in the Basel III Accord, may improve the resilience of a bank to systemic events, they also demonstrate that bank size, the share of non-interest income and asset growth (none of which are at the centre of the new regulatory landscape) are key determinants of a bank's risk exposure. In particular, the introduction of a cap on bank absolute size appears the most effective tool, ceteris paribus, to reduce the default risk of a bank given systemic events. Furthermore, in spite of the integration process of the financial industry in Europe, the analysis presented here shows that such a cap should be country-specific with smaller economies requiring smaller banks. Finally, we show that the strengthening of individual bank stability obtained via size restrictions is accompanied by a reduction of the contribution to systemic risk for banks which are relatively large compared to the domestic economy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Banking risk; European banking; Macroprudential regulation; Microprudential regulation",,"Vallascas, F.; Leeds University Business School, , Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; email: fv@lubs.leeds.ac.uk",,,02615606,,,,"English","J.

Our main hypothesis is that a high level of domestic debt combined with default risk explains this persistence, even after a decline in inflation rates. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) in a panel data analysis, our results show that inflation risks caused by increasing probability of default account for financial dollarization more than inflation rate itself. After the decrease in inflation rates, the foreign currency-denominated deposits remain large because of the high debt-to-GDP ratios, particularly in speculative-grade economies. High public indebtedness leads to expectations of default. Dollarization is a rational response to the future inflation associated with investors' expectations of default observed in highly indebted economies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Financial dollarization; Risk of default; Risk of inflation",,"Holland, M.; Sao Paulo School of Economics, Rua Itapeva 474, São Paulo, SP 01332-000, Brazil; email: marcio.holland@fgv.br",,,02615606,,,,"English","J.

The main analysis employs data for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device firms with publicly traded stock on US exchanges (including foreign-owned firms) with at least $100 million of market capitalization during the periods 2001-2005 and 2006-2008. Two frameworks are used for estimating firms' risk and the cost of equity capital: the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the empirically driven three risk-factor model of Fama and French (the F-F model). The article is organized as follows. The first section briefly reviews prior work and discusses the likely relation between the cost of equity capital and R&D intensity. The next section outlines the CAPM and F-F models and their empirical implementation. The data and samples are discussed in the third section. The fourth section presents beta and cost of equity capital estimates for equally weighted portfolios formed by sector and by sector and firm size. The fifth section presents results concerning the relationship between individual firm betas and R&D intensity, and it is followed by a final concluding section. © 2012 by Oxford University Press.

This article examines the rationale for capital regulation and describes the key features of Basel II. It focuses on the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of Basel II, and the challenges in rating the riskiness of assets contained in bank portfolios. A key issue identified is the extent to which the bank risk rating systems are responsive to changes in borrower default risk over the business cycle. If this is indeed the case, capital requirements under the Internal-Ratings-Based approach will increase as an economy moves into recession and decline as an economy moves an expansion.

Bayesian methods allow us to formally incorporate human judgement in the estimation of asset correlation, through the prior distribution and fully characterize a confidence set for the correlations. Results indicate: i) a two factor model rather than the one factor model, as proposed by the Basel II framework, better represents the historical default data. ii) importance of unobserved factors in this type of models is reinforced and point out that the levels of the implied asset correlations critically depend on the latent state variable used to capture the dynamics of default, as well as other assumptions on the statistical model. iii) the posterior distributions of the asset correlations show that the Basel recommended bounds, for this parameter, undermine the level of systemic risk. © Revista de Economía del Rosario.

We study which network architecture can make the financial system more resilient to random attacks and how systemic risk spreads over the network. To perturb the system, we generate a random attack via a liquidity shock. The hit bank is not automatically eliminated, but its failure is endogenously driven by its incapacity to raise liquidity in the interbank network.

On December 23, the so-called four pillars announced simultaneously that their subsidiaries in New Zealand had settled with the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department (IRD) in respect of long-running litigation that resulted in payments of unpaid tax and interest totaling some NZ$2.2 billion. The settlement followed a finding in October 2009, in the High Court of New Zealand, in favor of the local tax authorities regarding a series of “structured finance transactions”, which the IRD claimed were specifically designed to avoid paying tax in New Zealand. The transactions in dispute, which numbered only around thirty across the four banks, were, at face value, highly complex and intricate, but, when stripped of the “smoke and mirrors” were little more than standard commercial loans. The profitability, or otherwise, of these disputed transactions depended very much on how profits, losses and tax were accounted for. Because of various tax treaties between New Zealand and Australia, the Australian parents of New Zealand banks are able, under certain circumstances, to offset operating losses against profits being repatriated from New Zealand. This, in effect, could turn a loss-making transaction into a powerful device for shielding profits from tax. The Inland Revenue argued that this tax benefit was, in fact, the “tax tail that wagged the commercial dog” in such transactions. New Zealand courts at various levels agreed with this interpretation and unanimously found that the banks concerned were using these transactions to avoid paying tax. This paper argues that the losses to the Australian banks incurred as a result of the New Zealand tax scandal were, for the most part, a result of systemic operational risk, and, in particular, legal risk. Using examples from published court cases, the paper identifies some of the legal risk that arose using these transactions. The paper then suggests proactive approaches to systemic risk management that should help detect and minimize the impact of similar scandals in future. © 2012, Incisive Media Ltd.

Instead, they and their subsidiaries are subject to a separate regime prescribed in federal law, called a conservatorship or receivership. Under this regime, the conservator or receiver, which generally is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is provided substantial authority to deal with virtually every aspect of the insolvency. The failure of most other financial institutions within bank, thrift, and financial holding company umbrellas (including the holding companies themselves) generally are dealt with under the Bankruptcy Code. Two clear lessons of the 2008 recession are that no financial institution, regardless of its size, complexity, or diversification, is invincible, and the failure of large or highly interconnected financial firms can negatively impact other companies and the financial system as a whole. Congress, as a result, is left with the question of how best to handle the failure of these so-called ""systemically significant financial companies"" (SSFCs). Some have proposed legislation that would impose a conservatorship/receivership regime, much like that for depository institutions, on insolvent financial institutions that are deemed systemically significant. Others have proposed resolving these institutions through a new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. In order to make a policy assessment concerning the appropriateness and likely effectiveness of these proposals, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences between insured depositories and other financial institutions large enough or interconnected enough to pose systemic risk to the U.S. economy upon failure, as well as the differences between the Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority. To address these questions, other CRS reports analyze the FDIC's conservatorship and receivership powers over failed banks and thrifts and compare the FDIC's resolution regime with the Bankruptcy Code. This report seeks to build on those reports by examining the specific failures of two large financial institutions: IndyMac Bancorp, Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI). It should be noted that the resolutions of these two companies and their subsidiaries hadn't been completed at the time this report was written. At times, there are gaps in the information provided in this report, either as a result of the dearth of information publicly available or the opaqueness of that which is available. For example, Table 2 in this report generally does not include information regarding the primary business activities of LBHI's foreign subsidiaries, but certain foreign subsidiaries were included in the table to provide some perspective as to the breadth of LBHI's global reach, as well as in the financial services its subsidiaries provided. While this report is not an exhaustive analysis of the resolution of these two companies, in conjunction with our other reports, it does attempt to enhance the debate regarding how to structure the insolvency regimes for financial institutions. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Financial firms are said to be TBTF when policymakers judge that their failure would cause unacceptable disruptions to the overall financial system. Financial firms can be TBTF because of their size or interconnectedness. In addition to fairness issues raised by preventing a TBTF firm from failing, economic theory suggests that TBTF causes a moral hazard problem. Moral hazard refers to the fact that if TBTF firms know that failure will be prevented, they have an incentive to take greater risks than they otherwise would because they are shielded from the negative consequences of those risks. Specific assistance to TBTF firms, in contrast to broadly based programs, has proven to be the most costly intervention that the government undertook in the crisis. There are a number of policy approaches-some complementary, some conflicting-to coping with the TBTF problem. These include: providing government assistance to prevent TBTF firms from failing or systemic risk from spreading; enforcing ""market discipline"" to ensure that investors, creditors, and counterparties curb excessive risk-taking at TBTF firms; enhanced regulation to hold TBTF firms to stricter prudential standards than other financial firms; curbing firms' size and scope, by preventing mergers or compelling firms to divest assets, for example; minimizing spillover effects by limiting counterparty exposure; instituting a special resolution regime, in the event of the failure of a systemically important firm, that would be administrative rather than judicial. A comprehensive policy is likely to incorporate more than one approach since some approaches are aimed at preventing TBTF, and some at containing fallout when a TBTF firm has failed. Parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203) address all of these policy approaches. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created a special enhanced prudential regulatory regime for financial firms identified as ""systemically significant"" by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve will administer this regulatory regime. Depending on which firms are identified as systemically significant, this could result in certain non-bank financial firms being federally regulated for safety and soundness for the first time. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a special resolution regime administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to take into receivership failing firms that pose a threat to financial stability. This regime is similar to how the FDIC resolves failing banks, but with some important differences. The major changes in the Dodd-Frank Act remain in the implementation phase. The US Financial Stability Oversight Council has not yet identified any firm as ""systemically significant,"" and therefore subject to heightened prudential regulation. The Financial Stability Board, an international forum, identified 29 financial firms as ""systemically important financial institutions"" in November 2011. Eight of the 29 firms are headquartered in the United States. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Currently, there is a lack of consensus among experts on the nature of these associations and confusion among health care providers and the public on how to interpret this rapidly growing body of science. This article overviews the current evidence linking periodontal diseases to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, preterm low birth weight babies, respiratory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence Acquisition: Evidence was taken from systematic reviews, clinical trials, and mechanistic studies retrieved in searches of the PubMed electronic database. The available data provide the basis for applied practical clinical recommendations. Evidence Synthesis: Evidence is summarized and critically reviewed from systematic reviews, primary clinical trials, and mechanistic studies Conclusions: Surrogate markers for chronic periodontitis, such as tooth loss, show relatively consistent but weak associations with multiple systemic conditions. Despite biological plausibility, shorter-term interventional trials have generally not supported unambiguous cause-and-effect relationships. Nevertheless, the effective treatment of periodontal infections is important to achieve oral health goals, as well as to reduce the systemic risks of chronic local inflammation and bacteremias. Inflammatory periodontal diseases exhibit an association with multiple systemic conditions. With pregnancy as a possible exception, the local and systemic effects of periodontal infections and inflammation are usually exerted for many years, typically among those who are middle-aged or older. It follows that numerous epidemiological associations linking chronic periodontitis to age-associated and biologically complex conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, respiratory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers, erectile dysfunction, kidney disease and dementia, have been reported. In the coming years, it seems likely that additional associations will be reported, despite adjustments for known genetic, behavioral and environmental confounders. Determining cause-and-effect mechanisms is more complicated, especially in circumstances where systemic effects may be subtle. Currently, however, there is a lack of consensus among experts on the nature of these associations and confusion among health care providers and the public on how to interpret this rapidly growing body of science.

This conceptual article argues that exit values do not reflect the value of the net assets of the firm to shareholders, which is best reflected by discounted cash flows to maturity. Moreover, exit values-biasing fair values downward when markets are illiquid-have a pernicious, systemic risk effect; specifically, they give rise to write-downs that in turn cause contagion: prices of equities and other financial instruments of peers react negatively, leading to further write-downs by those peers. This may have aggravated the recent financial crisis. However, while exit values are not proper measures of value to shareholders, they are useful measures of downside risk when prospects turn sour for a firm. Thus, both exit values and discounted cash flows should be presented in financial statements. © CAAA/ACPC.","Exit values; Fair values; Systemic risk; Valuation",,"Ronen, J.; New York UniversityUnited States",,,1911382X,,,,"English","Account.

In particular, every firm is represented by a Pólya-like urn, whose reinforcement is function of time, of the neighboring urns and their compositions, and of a random variable representing systemic risk or fate. The simple idea is to build the dependence among firms by assuming simple balance sheet rules on debts and credits. In detail we assume that the debts of every company are credits for some of its neighbors. Debts and credits are represented by different balls in the urns/firms. At the same time we assume that the riskiness of every firm also depends on the economic wealth of its neighbors and of the economy in general. These simple rules are sufficient to create business cycles, in which the accumulation of debts pushes the economy towards frequent crises. The model can be easily simulated and the results we obtain encourage the development of brand new finitary probabilistic approaches to study firms' behavior and dynamics. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Cascading failures; contagion; financial fragility; GEV; Ising models; networks; Pólya urn; power law",,"Cirillo, P.; Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Sciences, Sidlerstrasse 5, CH-3012, Bern, Switzerland; email: pasquale.cirillo@stat.unibe.ch",,,02195259,,,,"English","Adv.

Notably, we consider the effect of heterogeneous degree distributions, heterogeneous balance sheet size and degree correlations between banks. We study the probability of contagion conditional on the failure of a random bank, the most connected bank and the biggest bank, and we consider the effect of targeted policies aimed at increasing the capital requirements of a few banks with high connectivity or big balance sheets. Networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are shown to be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank, but more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly connected nodes. A power law distribution of balance sheet size is shown to induce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to contagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the biggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of high average degree. Finally, disassortative mixing, such as that observed in real banking networks, is shown to enhance the stability of the system. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Contagion; network models; systemic risk",,"Caccioli, F.; Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Hyde Park Road, Santa Fe, NM 87501, United States",,,02195259,,,,"English","Adv.

Banks can be subject to sectoral and aggregate domestic shocks. After integration they can share these risks in a complete interbank market. When banks have a comparative advantage in providing credit to certain industries, financial integration may induce banks to specialize in lending. An enhanced concentration in lending does not necessarily increase risk, because a well-functioning interbank market allows to achieve the necessary diversification. This greater need for risk sharing, though, increases the risk of cross-border contagion and the likelihood of widespread banking crises. However, even though integration increases the risk of contagion it improves welfare if it permits banks to realize specialization benefits. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Financial contagion; Financial integration; Interbank market; Specialization","banking; comparative advantage; economic integration; financial system; lending behavior; macroeconomics; specialization","Fecht, F.; EBS Business School, Wiesbaden, Germany; email: gruener@uni-mannheim.de",,,00221996,,,,"English","J.

If the income of banks decreases, they mass-reduce their lendings; if corporations sales drop, and they cannot adjust their liquidities by further borrowing due to existing debt, then they must immediately reduce their expenses, lay off staff, and cancel investments. This hyperreaction produces a bifurcation mechanism, and eventually a strong dynamical instability in capital markets that is commonly called systemic risk. In this article, we show that this instability can be monitored by measuring the highest eigenvalue of a matrix of elasticities. These elasticities measure the reaction of each sector of the economy to a drop in its revenues from another sector. This highest eigenvalue-the spectral radius-of the elasticity matrix can be used as an early indicator of market instability and potential crisis. Grandmont and subsequent research showed the possibility that the 'invisible hand' of markets becomes chaotic, opening the door to uncontrolled swings. Our contribution is to provide an actual way of measuring how close to chaos the market is.

An application of our methodology to a portfolio of twenty-two major banks in Asia and the Pacific illustrates the dynamics of the spillover effects of the global financial crisis to the region. The increase in the perceived systemic risk, particularly after the failure of Lehman Brothers, was mainly driven by the heightened risk aversion and the squeezed liquidity. Further analysis, which is based on our proposed approach to quantifying the marginal contribution of individual banks to the systemic risk, suggests that "" too-big-to-fail"" is a valid concern from a macro-prudential perspective of bank regulation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..","Credit default swap; Dynamic conditional correlation; Macro-prudential regulation; Portfolio distress loss; Systemic risk",,"Huang, X.; Department of Economics, 729 Elm Avenue, Hester Hall, Norman, OK 73019, United States; email: xhuang@ou.edu",,,15723089,,,,"English","J.

Any regulatory framework for achieving these goals, however, will be imperfect and have tradeoffs. Increasing financial complexity has created information failures that even disclosure cannot remedy, whereas lawimposed standardization would have its own flaws. Bounded human rationality limits the effectiveness of even otherwise ideal laws. Furthermore, the increasing dispersion of financial risk is undermining monitoring incentives. We also do not yet fully understand how systemic risk is triggered and spread. Because regulation therefore cannot prevent systemic shocks, regulation should also operate to reduce systemic consequences by stabilizing parts of the financial system afflicted by those shocks.",,,"Schwarcz, S.L.; University School of LawUnited States",,,0043650X,,,,"English","Wis.

Diabetic retinopathy has a significant impact on public health and the quality of life of many patients, and thus requires noteworthy consideration. The first line of treatment remains the management of systemic risk factors, but is often insufficient in controlling DME. For 25 years, the focal/grid laser photocoagulation was considered the standard of care for DME. Laser treatment reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50%, but it is not associated with remarkable effects on visual improvement. Lately, new approaches in the treatment of DME have been considered; in particular the employment of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. VEGF is a pluripotent growth factor that functions as a vasopermeability factor and an endothelial cell mitogen, and thereby represents an appealing candidate as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DME.

As an application, we analyse a new and unique dataset on the USD 1.2 trillion FED emergency loans program to global financial institutions during 2008g-2010. We find that a group of 22 institutions, which received most of the funds, form a strongly connected graph where each of the nodes becomes systemically important at the peak of the crisis.

Administrations and regulatory bodies have to publish rules for the protection of the public, decide whether to authorize the use of a chemical product or the construction of a new plant, limit the environmental impact, regulate waste disposal, etc. All these rules i.e. the legislative, normative and procedural corpus of a country, a state, a city or a factory can be designated to a barrier function. These barriers are indispensable and play an important role in industrial safety management. In developed countries, growth during the past few years in the number of laws directed at regulating environmental and safety aspects in industry is well known to everyone. Now the definition, classification and performance of the legislative and normative barriers definitely allow the management of technological risks. So it is possible to permit the identification of the flux of hazard and to perform risk reduction in order to enhance the acceptability in a regional context. A systemic risk analysis methodology was applied to Colombian industrial sectors. The current legislation was analyzed with three scenarios. A global panorama of the different existing instruments allowing future management opportunities was suggested. The obtained analysis results propose a point of view, which could be useful for a local government or a whole national system to evaluate or improve the risk legislative and normative barriers.

The positive effect results from reduction in the uncertainty inherently present in large-scale systems. The negative effect, which can be mitigated through congestion pricing, is due to agent selfishness. However, current research, concentrated around the notion of ""Price of Anarchy"", is mostly concerned with the negative effect. This paper evaluates systemic risks/benefits of selfish agent ability to acquire and exploit dynamic system information in a specific case of selfish routing in a large-scale, random, loss network. Our analysis indicates that the beneficial effect of this ability dominates in a case of high system uncertainty - low load, while the negative effect dominates in a case of low system uncertainty - high load. In the intermediate cases while the beneficial effect still dominates in the ""normal"" operating mode, the negative effect manifests itself in a risk of cascading overload driving the system to an emergent metastable, i.e., persistent, congested mode. Future research should consider resource allocation models with elastic selfish users and evaluate effect of the congestion pricing. © 2012 IEEE.","information availability; selfish agents; systemic risk","Beneficial effects; Congestion pricing; Dynamic environments; High load; Information availability; Loss networks; Low load; Network operations; Operating modes; Positive and negative effect; Price of anarchy; Resource allocation model; Resource allocation systems; Selfish Agents; Selfish routing; Selfish users; System information; System uncertainties; Resource allocation; Uncertainty analysis","Marbukh, V.; National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8920, United States; email: marbukh@nist.gov",,,,9781467302685,,,"English","Proc.

This has lead to the emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users.

The article first discusses the long term role of competition in the banking sector, commenting on policy developments prior to the crisis. Then the impact of the crisis is discussed focusing on two main areas of policy state: aids and bank regulation and supervision. The article culminates with the conclusions. The main findings about state aids are that the efforts of the Commission to ensure that aided companies would not use the government support to distort competition seem to be working. However, given that the full impact on competition of these aids may take years to be felt, the Commission should be prepared to take action where necessary to ensure that competition will be protected. The provision of state aids could not have been avoided due to the grave systemic risks associated with bank failures. In respect of regulation and supervision, the article concluded that there is a lot of work to be done in this area to ensure that mistakes that led to the crisis will not be repeated but also that there is need for the Commission to ensure that the reforms to the regulatory and supervisory architecture do not occur at the expense of competition. The article contains proposals about policy adjustments, thus contributing to the ongoing debate about the role of competition policy in the efforts to address the impact of the crisis. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Banks; Competition; Competitive strategy; Economic crisis; European Union; Financial sector; Regulation; State aids; Supervision",,"Kapsis, I.; Law School, , Bradford, United Kingdom",,,1754243X,,,,"English","Int.

In this study we addressed the molecular and cellular effects of elevated and suppressed levels of circulating cholesterol on the normal prostate. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was performed using DNA microarray data from two experimental formats: (1) ventral prostate from male mice with chronically elevated circulating cholesterol and (2) human prostate cells exposed acutely to cholesterol depletion. A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels. These findings open new perspectives on the role of cholesterol in prostate health, and provide a novel role for ATF3, and associated proteins within a large signaling network, as a cholesterol-sensing mechanism. © 2012 Kim et al.",,"activating transcription factor 3; cholesterol; activating transcription factor 3; ATF3 protein, human; Atf3 protein, mouse; cholesterol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell infiltration; cell proliferation; cholesterol synthesis; controlled study; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; human; human cell; hypocholesterolemia; in vivo study; male; male genital system function; microarray analysis; molecular model; molecular recognition; mouse; nonhuman; prostate; protein function; sensitivity analysis; signal transduction; structural bioinformatics; validation process; adipose tissue; animal; biosynthesis; blood; cell proliferation; metabolism; methodology; mouse mutant; physiology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Mus; Activating Transcription Factor 3; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cholesterol; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, SCID; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Prostate; Signal Transduction","Kim, J.; Division of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, , Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: Jayoung.Kim@cshs.org",,,19326203,,,"22768301","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863611350

Certain critics decry Council legislation as unconstitutional, null and void. Apologists retort that the Charter delegates broad power to the Council, and the impugned legislative resolutions fall well within the broad textual limitations on its competence. I propose an approach to constitutional analysis to help cut through this debate, based on distinguishing between two perspectives on the ""constitution"" of an international organization: the juridical perspective emphasizing the transmission of validity in the creation, interpretation, and application of legal norms; and the political perspective from which the ordering of power among the constituted bodies may be assessed in terms of legitimacy and justice. Distinguishing between the perspectives illuminates the merits of the arguments on both sides of the debate on the Council's competences. Juridically speaking, it is difficult to argue that the Council's innovations are unconstitutional and void. Yet the political perspective helps explain the critics' discomfort with the Council's expansive innovations; from the latter angle it appears that the Charter's broad, unreviewable, and effectively unamendable delegation of power to the Council yields a deeply flawed constitutional arrangement, entailing systemic risks of hegemonic international law-making and the demise of constitutionalism. © The Author 2012.

However, as this paper argues, many of the shortcomings stemming from these assumptions, together with the consequent economic policy of ""light regulation,"" were clearly revealed by the collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. This nearly brought about the collapse of the U.S. banking system and gave a clear practical demonstration that the economy is nonergodic. The paper discusses the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and shows how the lessons derived from that crisis were not learned. It also highlights the dangers of assuming that uncertainty can simply be treated as risk, as the Post Keynesians have long argued. Furthermore, it argues, following Akerlof (2007), that case studies can be just as, or indeed more, revealing than econometric testing. © 2012 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

In addition to examining key economic variables, it stresses certain inherent problems which prevent the European Monetary Union from turning into a genuine monetary integration, and comments on the efforts undertaken, in various levels, to shield the Eurozone from systemic risks. Empirical evidence concentrates on the evolution of the determinants of the 10-year bond interest rates for a group of Eurozone members and a group of European non-Eurozone members. The results indicate that the crisis brought the end to euphoria and confidence to global markets. Financial market volatility and risk, along with macrofundamental stability are gradually gaining higher importance as determinants of longterm interest rates, in the Eurozone. At the same time future EMU viability, beyond economic adjustment policies by the members, seems to require stronger economic policies at the centralised level and a fully fledged central bank role.","EMU; Government bonds; Interest rates",,"Alexakis, P.; University of Athens, Greece",,,09727302,,,,"English","Int.

To determine whether there were differences in drug use profiles, psychopathology, and severity of violence among regular illicit drug users in respect to the order of onset of drug use and violence. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional survey utilising self-report data was administered to 327 regular illicit drug users in Sydney, Australia. Results. Those who first committed violent crime prior to illicit drug use were found to have more serious offending patterns (greater frequency, arrest for more serious violence, earlier age of onset, and more weapon use). Being male, having a history of child abuse and greater severity of conduct disorder were independent predictors of committing violence before drug use. Discussion and Conclusions. Whilst the nature of the data does not permit causative conclusions, it appears that the order of onset of illicit drug use and violent crime is associated with heterogeneous offending patterns. Early onset violence was associated with more severe violent crimes in later adulthood, whereas violence which proceeded drug use was more strongly linked to systemic risks. The findings have implications for early intervention among children with conduct disorder and also for using drug and alcohol treatment services to reduce specific risks associated with violence. © 2011 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.","Drug; Offending; Onset; Violence","addiction; adolescent; adult; article; Australia; conduct disorder; crime; cross-sectional study; drug use; early intervention; female; human; male; middle aged; offender; psychological aspect; questionnaire; risk factor; self report; sex difference; statistics; violence; Adolescent; Adult; Australia; Conduct Disorder; Crime; Criminals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Users; Early Medical Intervention; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Self Report; Sex Factors; Substance-Related Disorders; Violence","Torok, M.; National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, , Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; email: m.torok@med.unsw.edu.au",,,09595236,,,"21726311","English","Drug Alcohol Rev.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861855055

Hypothesis: Infiltrative proliferation and satellite nodules are prognostic factors for local and systemic aggressiveness. Type of study: Retrospective cohort study. Patients and methods: In 105 patients under curative treatment, resection quality was assessed on UICC criteria (R0/R1) and on a modified version (R0. M/R1. M) taking account of proliferation contours and satellite nodules for narrow margins (< 1 mm). Uni- and multi-variate analysis was performed, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared on log-rank. Results: Mean 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was 0.64 [0.52-0.76] after R1 surgery, 0.9 [0.85-0.95] after R0, 0.64 [0.519-0.751] after R1. M and 0.92 [0.87-0.96] after R0. M. Resection type according to R classification correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) (P=0.028), but not with metastasis-free survival (MFS) (P=0.156). Resection type according to RM classification correlated with DFS and MFS. Multivariate analysis disclosed correlations between LRFS rate and RM resection type (HR 6.77 [1.78-25.7], P=0.005), DFS rate and RM resection type (HR 2.83 [1.47-5.43], P=0.001) and grade (HR. =3.17 [1.38-7.27], P=0.003), and MFS and grade (HR. =3.96 [1.50-10.5], P=0.006). Discussion: The microscopic aspect of the proliferation contours and presence of satellite nodules were confirmed as prognostic factors for local and systemic aggressiveness. They impact both disease-free survival and metastasis-free survival in case of margins less than 1. mm. Their systematic consideration may help identify patients with elevated systemic risk.

Residences in the inner city are prone to be damaged by waterlogging hazards. This paper describes the risk analysis of rainstorm waterlogging on residences in Shanghai. First, a rainstorm scenario of 50-year return period was simulated with the rainstorm simulation model from Shanghai Flood Risk Information Center. Each residence was ranked according to its degree of exposure indicated by the inundation depth of that residence, and an exposure analysis model was then built. It is found from the exposure analysis that residences in the sub-districts like Linfen Road, Pengpu Village, Gonghe New Village, Hongqiao Road, Xianxia Road, Xinhua Road, and Zhenru Town are at high-exposure level. Whereas residences in other sub-districts like Gaojing Town, Siping Road, Huaihai Road, Yuyuan, Waitan, Caojiadu, Nanjing East Road, etc. are at low-exposure level. Second, given the characteristics of residences in waterlogging, the vulnerability of residences was expressed as the proportion of old-style residences to total residences. The results show that residences in Yuyuan, Xiaodongmen, Waitan, Nanjing East Road, Laoximen, Zhapu Road, North Station, and Tilanqiao are the most vulnerable ones, while there is no vulnerability in Fenglin Road, Kongjiang Road, Liangcheng New Village, Quyang Road, Siping Road, and Xianxia Road due to the absence of old-style residences. Finally, a model has been built from a systematic perspective and then waterlogging risk analysis was quantified by multiplying the exposure value with vulnerability value of residences. The results reveal that Laoximen, Tilanqiao, Dinghai Road, North Station, Tianping Road, Hongmei Road, Hunan Road, and Xiaodongmen are at high-risk level. The systemic risk model is a simple tool that can be used to assess the relative risk of waterlogging in different regions and the results of risk analysis are applicable to prevention and mitigation of waterlogging for Shanghai Municipal Government. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Exposure; GIS; Residences; Risk; Scenario simulation; Shanghai; Vulnerability; Waterlogging","flooding; GIS; inner city area; numerical model; rainstorm; residential location; risk assessment; vulnerability; waterlogging; China; Shanghai","Shi, Y.; Department of Tourism and Management, , Zhengzhou 450001, China; email: yongshi@zzu.edu.cn",,,0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.

Banks swap assets to diversify their individual risk. Two asset structures arise. In a clustered structure, groups of banks hold common asset portfolios and default together. In an unclustered structure, defaults are more dispersed. Portfolio quality of individual banks is opaque but can be inferred by creditors from aggregate signals about bank solvency. When bank debt is short-term, creditors do not roll over in response to adverse signals and all banks are inefficiently liquidated. This information contagion is more likely under clustered asset structures.

Free riding leads to excess risk production. We consider two instruments usually adopted to tackle this problem: financial regulation and taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. We take a positive, political-economy perspective. We show that a majority of low-risk portfolio-owners may have a strategic incentive to use regulation rather than taxation in order to charge the minority a large share of the externality reduction. We also show that, when the majority chooses a tax, the probable level is socially too low. If the majority chooses regulation, the latter will possibly be too harsh. This eventually explains why financial regulation is more frequently adopted, and why incentives to circumvent it are so strong in reality. © Oxford University Press 2012.

County level data are available in longer time series, however. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to make full use of the information inherent in each of these data sets. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a novel application of statistical tools for using farm and county level yield data to generate farm level yield densities that explicitly incorporate within county yield heterogeneity while accounting for systemic risk and other spatial or intertemporal correlations among farms within the county. Findings – The empirical analysis shows that current approaches used by the Risk Management Agency to individualize premiums for a farm result in substantial mispricing of crop insurance premiums because they do not adequately capture farm yield variability and yield correlations between farms. The new premium setting method is empirically shown to substantially reduce government subsidies for crop insurance premiums. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates how to extract more information from available data when setting crop insurance premiums, which allows the government to more closely tailor premiums to the farm than do current approaches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agriculture; Copulas; Corn; Crop yield; Crops; Federal crop insurance; Insurance premiums; Monte Carlo simulation; Multivariate density functions; Soybeans; United States of America",,"Cooper, J.; Department of Market and Trade Economics, United States; email: jcooper@ers.usda.gov",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",00021466,,,,"English","Agric.

A number of disorders associated with reduced blood flow and ischaemia, collectively termed vascular risk factors, such as migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, atrial fibrillation and reduced nocturnal blood pressure, lead to decreased ocular perfusion pressure. During sleep, alterations occur in cardiovascular physiology that are balanced by autoregulation to maintain homeostasis. However, in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the normal physiological balance is upset. A potentially modifiable risk factor, OSA has been increasingly associated with glaucoma independent of intraocular pressure. OSA may alter blood flow to the optic nerve head and, in combination with other predisposing factors, lead to decreased ocular perfusion pressure. This in turn may directly affect the optic nerve or it may indirectly increase its susceptibility to other insults. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the association between OSA and glaucoma. © 2012 The Authors.

This paper considers the economic and strategic drivers of SIFIs - if such institutions are a key source of systemic risk, it is important to understand how and why they get that way. The paper then sets forth a public-interest perspective on the financial architecture by setting out key benchmarks - static and dynamic efficiency, stability and robustness, and competitiveness - and the tradeoffs that exist between them, and examines how SIFIs can support or detract from these benchmarks. If SIFIs are to be subject to much sharper prudential regulation, its impact must be calibrated against systemic performance benchmarks. Finally, the paper focuses on some of the major regulatory initiatives following the 2007-09 financial crisis, and in particular the US Dodd-Frank legislation of 2010, in terms of their possible impact on business models of SIFIs. The paper concludes that improving the financial architecture in a disciplined, consistent, internationally coordinated and sustained manner with a firm eye to the public interest should ultimately be centered on market discipline. By being forced to pay a significant price for the negative externalities SIFIs generate - in the form of systemic risk - managers and boards will have to draw their own conclusions regarding optimum institutional strategy and structure in the context of the microeconomics and industrial organization of global financial intermediation. If this fails, constraints on their size, complexity and interconnectedness will be a major part of the policy reaction to the next financial crisis. © 2012.","Economies of scale; Economies of scope; Financial architecture; Regulation; Shadow banking; Systemic risk",,"Walter, I.; Stern School of Business, United States; email: iwalter@stern.nyu.edu",,,10629769,,,,"English","Q.

Patients' age, gender, duration and type of diabetes mellitus, latest HbA1c result and presence or absence of co-morbid factors (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, nephropathy) were recorded together with the stage of diabetic retinopathy. These were correlated with DME. Out of 300 patients, HRT defined macula edema was seen in 68 patients (22.6%). There is a wider and higher range (95% percentile) of macula edema index in the severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group. Independent samples t test showed significant difference between the severe NPDR group and no DR group (p < 0.001), mild NPDR group (p < 0.05) and moderate NPDR group (p < 0.05). A higher macula edema index was also found to have a low degree of correlation with more advanced stages of retinopathy (r = 0.310; p < 0.001). Also nephropathy showed a strong and significant correlation with DME. Hypertension had moderately significant correlation with DME.

Investment funds use what is perhaps the most basic financial strategy, called 'value investing', i.e. systematically attempting to buy underpriced assets. When funds do not borrow, the price fluctuations of the asset are approximately normally distributed and uncorrelated across time. This changes when the funds are allowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, which allows them to purchase more assets than their wealth would otherwise permit. During good times, funds that use more leverage have higher profits, increasing their wealth and making them dominant in the market. However, if a downward price fluctuation occurs while one or more funds is fully leveraged, the resulting margin call causes them to sell into an already falling market, amplifying the downward price movement. If the funds hold large positions in the asset, this can cause substantial losses. This in turn leads to clustered volatility: before a crash, when the value funds are dominant, they damp volatility, and after the crash, when they suffer severe losses, volatility is high. This leads to power-law tails, which are both due to the leverage-induced crashes and due to the clustered volatility induced by the wealth dynamics. This is in contrast to previous explanations of fat tails and clustered volatility, which depended on 'irrational behavior', such as trend following. A standard (supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks base leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of low volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility becomes high, making these extreme fluctuations even worse. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Clustered volatility; Crash; Fat tails; Leverage; Margin calls; Systemic risk",,"Thurner, S.; Section of Science of Complex Systems, Spitalgasse 23, Vienna A-1090, Austria; email: stefan.thurner@meduniwien.ac.at",,,14697688,,,,"English","Quant.

Other reliable methods with lower side effects and shorter test duration are being investigated. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the nasal provocation test (NPT) and the basophil activation test (BAT) in the diagnosis of different subtypes of aspirin sensitivity. Methods: Thirty aspirin sensitivity patients with cutaneous and respiratory manifestations underwent NPT and BAT with lysine-ASA. NPT result was interpreted as recommended in EAACI/GA2LEN guidelines and receiver operating characteristic analysis of BAT was performed by using 15 NSAIDs tolerant volunteers as a control group. Results: NPT was positive in 60% (18/30) of patients and BAT was positive in 76.7% (23/30) of patients. The incubation of basophils with 0.31. mg/ml of lysine-aspirin and using 4.6% activated basophils gives the best predictive values to diagnose aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests yielded positive results in 80% and 93.3% of aspirin-induced cutaneous and respiratory patterns. The agreement between NPT and BAT results was 63.3%. Conclusions: NPT and BAT are beneficial to detect patients with aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests have additional diagnostic values; less time-consuming than OPT and their complications are negligible. A reliable alternative method with minimum side effects is needed to diagnose aspirin sensitivity in suspected patients who have contraindications for OPT. © 2010 SEICAP.","Aspirin sensitivity; Basophil activation test; Drug allergy; Nasal provocation test","acetylsalicylic acid; lysine acetylsalicylate; adolescent; adult; aged; allergic urticaria; angioneurotic edema; article; aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease; basophil; basophil activation test; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic value; drug hypersensitivity; female; human; immediate type hypersensitivity; immune function test; male; nose provocation test; practice guideline; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; single blind procedure; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Aspirin; Asthma, Aspirin-Induced; Basophil Degranulation Test; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Provocation Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Single-Blind Method; Young Adult","Klaewsongkram, J.; Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, , Bangkok, Thailand; email: Jettanong.K@chula.ac.th",,,03010546,,AGIMB,"21492991","English","Allergol.

Two of us, with coauthors, have argued elsewhere that there is no socially beneficial purpose for this overreliance on debt, and that such reliance increases the likelihood of taxpayer bailouts with their associated economic, financial, and social costs. Some academics and bankers continue to insist, however, that increased equity is cosdy for banks and for society. The arguments proffered in defense of these propositions contradict the most basic insights from corporate finance, and often neglect to distinguish private costs from social costs in explaining diis preference for debtheavy capital structures. While excessive bank debt can impose overwhelming costs on the broader economy, some contend that there may be some benefits from debt for a firm's corporate governance. In particular, some academics have argued that debt is useful because it disciplines bank management. The idea suggests that creditors with hard claims against the firm will monitor the firm in order to prevent bank management from misusing the free cash flows that the banks'economic activities generate. If these benefits exist and are substantial, we may face a vexing tradeoff: Too much debt creates dramatic social costs, moral hazard, and systemic risk, while too litde may have negative consequences for firm governance. The challenge is to find a way to optimize that tradeoff. This Article engages that challenge and introduces a new kind of financial institution-a liability holding company (LHC)-that appropriately balances the social costs of excessive private leverage with the purported benefits for corporate governance that such leverage might create. Our proposal places an increased-liability version of the bank's equity in a conjoined but separately controlled entity, the LHC, which also owns other assets to which the banks' liabilities have recourse in the event of failure. The equity shares of the LHC-a holding company subject to a unique regulatory regime supervised by the Federal Reserve, similar to bank holding companies-are then traded in public markets. The LHC thus aims to eliminate or, at least, to greatly reduce the role of the government as the effective guarantor of the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), thereby reducing the distortions created by current implicit governmental guarantees. It additionally allows banks the benefits of two boards: an advising board that the bank managers may appoint and the monitoring board that is housed at the LHC and appointed by the LHC's own public shareholders. This dual-board structure resolves some important issues raised in the longstanding debate about the role that corporate boards should play. We discuss in detail how this proposal would function within the present legal and regulatory environment-particularly within the contexts of bank regulation, corporate governance, and the Dodd-Frank Act-and address counterarguments and alternative proposals.",,,"Admati, A.R.; Stanford University Graduate School of BusinessUnited States",,,00415650,,,,"English","UCLA Law Rev.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862702763

Defaults tend to cluster around times of economic stress due to poor macro-economic conditions, but also by directly triggering each other through contagion. Although credit default swaps have radically altered the dynamics of contagion for more than a decade, models quantifying their impact on systemic risk are still missing. Here, we examine contagion through credit default swaps in a stylized economic network of corporates and financial institutions. We analyse such a system using a stochastic setting, which allows us to exploit limit theorems to exactly solve the contagion dynamics for the entire system. Our analysis shows that, by creating additional contagion channels, CDS can actually lead to greater instability of the entire network in times of economic stress. This is particularly pronounced when CDS are used by banks to expand their loan books (arguing that CDS would offload the additional risks from their balance sheets). Thus, even with complete hedging through CDS, a significant loan book expansion can lead to considerably enhanced probabilities for the occurrence of very large losses and very high default rates in the system. Our approach adds a new dimension to research on credit contagion, and could feed into a rational underpinning of an improved regulatory framework for credit derivatives. © EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2012.",,"Balance sheets; CdS; Corporates; Credit default Swap; Credit derivatives; Credit risks; Default rates; Economic networks; Entire system; Financial crisis; Financial institution; Interconnected network; Limit theorem; New dimensions; Regulatory frameworks; Still missing; Stochastic settings; Risk assessment; Dynamics","Heise, S.; Mathematics Department, , WC2R 2LS London, United Kingdom; email: reimer.kuehn@kcl.ac.uk",,,14346028,,,,"English","Eur.

The analysis first explains how a derivatives clearinghouse can successfully reduce systemic risk by analyzing LCH.Clearnet's management of the Lehman default in 2008. Next, the analysis demonstrates that if a clearinghouse could not manage a default and became insolvent, systemic risk would greatly increase. Rather than containing the impact of a counterparty default, an insolvent clearinghouse would enhance systemic risk because the two existing resolution regimes, the Bankruptcy Code and the Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority, could not successfully unwind the institution. The primary contribution of this Note is identifying that an insolvent derivatives clearinghouse creates an unsolvable problem with respect to resolution: untangling the derivatives trades will inevitably take more than a day, but if sorting out the portfolios takes even a few days, clearing members will start a run on the clearinghouse. The resulting enhanced systemic risk would necessitate government intervention. A major derivatives clearinghouse would be too big to fail. Accordingly, this Note proposes two recommendations to ensure that derivatives clearinghouses effectively reduce systemic risk. Regulators should: (1) minimize the risk of clearinghouse insolvency through strict collateral, capital, and default management requirements, and (2) create an ex ante guarantee fund to serve as a government backstop and provide liquidity to an insolvent derivatives clearinghouse, thereby avoiding enhanced systemic risk.",,,"Allen, J.

Methods: In this population-based study, 3172 persons of Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicities 40 years and older were included. Participants underwent comprehensive systemic and ocular examination, retinal photography, and laboratory investigations. Early and late AMD signs were graded from retinal photographs. Age-standardized prevalence estimates were calculated using the 2010 Singapore adult population as the standard population. Association with a range of systemic risk factors was analyzed. Results: Of 3172 participants, AMD was present in 211 subjects. Age-standardized prevalence of AMD was 7.0% in persons 40 years and older. The age-standardized prevalence was similar in all 3 Asian ethnic groups: Chinese, 7.3%; Malay, 7.7%; and Indian, 5.7% (P value=.44). The prevalence increased with age and was higher in men. Of the range of risk factors evaluated, only myopic refractive error (<-0.5 D) was significantly associated with a lower risk for AMD (odds ratio, 0.44; P<.001, compared with emmetropia) in Chinese men.

There is little data regarding the impact of the disease and treatments on sexual function. The aim of this study was to describe the results of an assessment of sexual activity/sexual satisfaction of rheumatoid arthritis patients, identify the sexual dysfunction features, and assess their association with disease activity/disease activity parameters and other systemic risk factors/comorbidities. Consecutive rheumatoid arthritis patients attending the outpatient rheumatology clinic completed the multidimensional patient-reported outcome measures questionnaire. There are three questions screening for sexual dysfunction: patients who ticked any of the boxes were further assessed. Men completed the Sexual Health Inventory for Men; whereas women completed the Female Sexual Function Index. All patients underwent clinical assessment of disease activity parameters and cardiovascular risk. Among 231 rheumatoid arthritis patients included in this study, 49/91 (53.8%) men and 64/140 (45.7%) women reported sexual dysfunction. Among men, erectile dysfunction significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with pain score, cardiovascular disease, age, disease activity, fatigue score, intramuscular steroid injection, and tender joint count. Among women, sexual dysfunction was significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with occurrence of secondary Sjogren's syndrome, pain score, cardiovascular disease, hip joint involvement, disease activity, and tender joint count. Sexual dysfunction is common among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Erectile dysfunction in men, and problems with orgasm, arousal, and satisfaction in women, were the most prevalent manifestations.

However, since the sub prime crisis, it is believed by investors and regulators that the systemic risk of Hong Kong REITs could increase gradually, and the value of REITs could decrease gradually. This paper seeks to confirm whether the systemic risk of Asia REITs changes in the sub prime crisis or not. MGARCH model is applied to analyze the co-movement between all Hong Kong REITs and the Hang Seng stock market over the past five years. The empirical results show that: the condition covariances of Hong Kong REITs do have a measure of incensement during the sub prime crisis, and quickly turn to the level of low-risk securities after the sub prime crisis. At the same time, the time-varying beta values are relatively low in the five years. These conclusions demonstrate that the systemic risk of REITs does not change in the sub prime crisis, and remains at a relatively low level. Therefore, Hong Kong REIT is still a kind of the investment tool with stabile income and low risk. These findings are of significance for portfolio risk management and industry regulation, and are beneficial to the process of China mainland REITs.","Dynamic condition covariance; MGARCH model; REITs; Systemic risks","Dynamic condition; Empirical research; Hong-kong; Low level; Portfolio risk management; REITs; Stock market; Time-varying beta; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Risk management","Weiming, H.; School of Management, China; email: whelmingchina@yahoo.com.cn",,,19763700,,,,"English","Adv.

The overriding theme of the book is to pose two approaches to attaining financial stability in the future. One approach is to establish a council of wise men and women supported by an army of highly skilled professional financial economists to formulate and implement regulations designed to prevent future financial crises that wreak havoc on the real economy and require financial support from taxpayers. This is the approach of the Dodd-Frank Act. The second approach proposed by the authors of this book is to design a taxing system that taxes systemically important financial institutions on the basis of their contribution to systemic risk. Borrowing ideas from the literature on the taxation of negative externalities their view is that financial institutions that create crises should pay for the clean-up. They also argue that requiring the financial polluters to pay for the creation of systemic risk will reduce the supply of systemic risk.

We still know little about the concert of local and systemic risk factors and underlying causes that finally lead to the development of calciphylaxis. Recent work from Asia points towards persistent uncertainties in the diagnosis and management of the disease which the nephrology community has to address by establishing standards in both diagnosis as well as treatment strategies. Hayashi et al. have published results from a Japanese survey in which the authors collected data from calciphylaxis patients and compared clinical and laboratory data with those of control subjects. This innovative approach allowed the authors to calculate relative risks for various parameters in terms of calciphylaxis development.

Methods: The REduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry provided a prospective multinational cohort of 7996 outpatients with PAD enrolled from primary medical clinics in 44 countries in 2003-2004. 1160 patients (14.5%) had a prior leg amputation at any level. Systemic (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, cardiovascular death) and limb (angioplasty, surgery, amputation) ischemic event rates were determined in a 3-year follow-up. Results: PAD patients with leg amputations on entry had a 5-fold higher rate of a subsequent amputation (12.4% vs. 2.4%, P<.001), lower rate of peripheral angioplasty (8.3% vs. 10.7%, P=.005), and similar rates of surgical revascularization procedures compared with PAD patients without amputation. A nearly 2-fold increase in rates of cardiovascular death (14.5% vs. 7.7%, P<.001) and all-cause mortality (21.8% vs. 12.6%, P<.001) and an increase in the composite outcome of MI, stroke, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization (48.7% vs. 40.0%, P<.001) were noted. Recent (≤1 year) amputation was associated with higher rates of worsening PAD, subsequent lower extremity surgical revascularization procedures, re-amputation, non-fatal MI, and the composite outcome, including hospitalization. Adverse systemic and limb ischemic outcomes were similar regardless of amputation level. Conclusions: Individuals with a history of leg amputations have markedly elevated rates of systemic and limb-related outcomes. PAD patients with recent ischemic amputation have the highest risk of adverse events. A history of "" minor"" ischemic amputation may confer an identical systemic risk as "" major"" leg amputation. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Amputation; Atherosclerosis; Critical limb ischemia; Health outcomes; Myocardial infarction; Peripheral artery disease","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; antithrombocytic agent; biguanide derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; sulfonylurea derivative; adult; aged; amputation; angioplasty; antihypertensive therapy; article; death; female; follow up; heart infarction; hospitalization; human; leg amputation; limb ischemia; major clinical study; male; peripheral occlusive artery disease; priority journal; risk reduction; stroke; Aged; Amputation; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Ischemia; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Registries; Reoperation; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome","Abola, M.T.B.; Medical Arts Building; Philippine Heart Center, Suite 409, 4th floor, East Avenue, Quezon City, 1100, Philippines; email: tesabola@mac.com",,,00219150,,ATHSB,"22321872","English","Atherosclerosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858704479

Global financial variables possess explanatory power during the pre-crisis and the crisis period. Liquidity proxy variables are significantly related to spread changes for financials, while unrelated for non-financials. Examination of the risk factors' explanatory power for large spread changes reveals weakened significance indicating that additional factors are necessary for their explanation. Finally, we examine the lead-lag relationship between spread changes and stock returns.

The principle hypothesis behind the work is that the ROA provides a foundation for long-term growth as a type of fundamental variable, and that this growth provides a buffer against systemic risk in the sense that sustainable growth provides resources for debt provision and employment stimulation. The emergence of a viable ROA is crucial for long waves of growth which stimulate both private sector profit and public sector tax receipts which (using conventional terminology) reduce the structural deficit for both sectors. Low rates of long-term growth, therefore, provide a good indicator of the emergence of ""long wave systemic risk"" (LWSR), which left such nations vulnerable to uncertainty, financial crisis and recession. The paper investigates the inability of growth for various decades to ""cover"" instabilities associated with the Great Crisis, leading to high rates of LWSR, especially for European and North American nations that bore the brunt of the crisis.","Great international crisis; Institutional regimes; Long wave systemic risk",,"O'Hara, P.

Expiry date management is a regulation requirement to which the laboratories respond without any real scientific justification. Conducting experimental studies of reagent stability would be excessive. It is nonetheless possible to adopt a preventive approach by managing the risk of loss of integrity of the reagent. In this context, a multidisciplinary SFSTP commission (French science and pharmaceutical techniques society) has developed a risk approach based on the process encompassing all the steps in the reagent's life cycle. It proposes a simple and effective methodology for calculating the expiry dates of reagents after opening. The operator will be guided in the determination of the systemic risk for his own laboratory, weighted by the control of its analytical methods and by the instability and alterability characteristics of the reagents. The methodology designed on the PIC/S example is iterative and shall be able to benefit from scientific knowledge acquired from the table of the alterability criteria of unstable reagents that the commission shall provide.","Expiry; Integrity; Reagents; Risk management","reagent; solvent; diagnostic procedure; information processing; laboratory; review; risk assessment","Bauthier-Loiseau, É.; Technologie Servier, 25-27, rue Eugène-Vignat, F-45000 Orléans, France; email: eliane.loiseau@fr.netgrs.com",,,11571497,,SPPRE,,"French; English","STP Pharma Prat.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862737926

The transdermal absorption by vertical Franz diffusion cells of the compounds entrapped in niosomes (Nio FOP), the unentrapped compounds (Mixed FOP), the compounds incorporated in gel and cream (Gel FOP and Cream FOP), and the compounds entrapped in niosomes and incorporated in gel and cream (Gel nio and Cream nio) was investigated. At 6 h, F and P from Nio FOP gave lower cumulative amount in viable epidermis and dermis (VED) than from Mixed FOP of 1.1 and 1.6 times, respectively, while O from Nio FOP exhibited higher cumulative amount in VED than from Mixed FOP of 2.4 times. The highest cumulative amount in VED of F, O, and P were from Gel nio, Cream nio, and Mixed FOP at 1.564±0.052, 15.972±0.273, and 25.857±0.025 ng/cm2, respectively. Niosomes enhanced the transdermal absorption of the hydrophobic compound O, while retarded the hydrophilic compounds F and P indicating the less systemic risk of F and P than O when entrapped in niosomes. Thus, transdermal absorption of F, O, and P appeared to depend on niosomal size, lipophilicity of the bioactive compounds, and types of formulations.

The subject of the case study is the securitization of home loans, an innovation which played a critical and still not fully understood role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The Article introduces the term ""fragmentation node"" for these transaction structures, and it shows how specific sources of complexity inherent in fragmentation nodes limited transparency and flexibility in ways that undermined the stability of the financial system. In addition to shedding new light on the processes through which financial innovations become so complex and how that complexity contributes to new sources of systemic risk, the Article considers the tools regulators will need to tackle these sources of systemic risk. The policy analysis shows that disclosure, a tool commonly used in financial regulation, will not suffice. At times, regulators should target these new sources of systemic risk directly by seeking to reduce the length and complexity of the chain connecting investor and investment. The Article suggests some modest steps regulators could have taken prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, such as a transaction tax targeting serial fragmentation nodes, to illustrate how such reforms might work in practice.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A pooled analysis using individual participant data from population-based studies around the world was performed. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all population-based studies in general populations or individuals with diabetes who had ascertained DR from retinal photographs. Studies provided data for DR end points, including any DR, proliferative DR, diabetic macular edema, and VTDR, and also major systemic risk factors. Pooled prevalence estimates were directly age-standardized to the 2010 World Diabetes Population aged 20-79 years. RESULTS - A total of 35 studies (1980-2008) provided data from 22,896 individuals with diabetes. The overall prevalence was 34.6% (95% CI 34.5-34.8) for any DR, 6.96% (6.87-7.04) for proliferative DR, 6.81% (6.74-6.89) for diabetic macular edema, and 10.2% (10.1-10.3) for VTDR. All DR prevalence end points increased with diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, and blood pressure levels and were higher in people with type 1 compared with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS - There are approximately 93 million people with DR, 17 million with proliferative DR, 21million with diabeticmacular edema, and 28million with VTDR worldwide. Longer diabetes duration and poorer glycemic and blood pressure control are strongly associated with DR. These data highlight the substantial worldwide public health burden of DR and the importance of modifiable risk factors in its occurrence. This study is limited by data pooled from studies at different time points, with different methodologies and population characteristics. © 2012 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"cholesterol; hemoglobin A1c; adolescent; adult; aged; article; blood pressure regulation; child; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; diabetic macular edema; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; diastolic blood pressure; disease duration; ethnicity; female; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; mydriasis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; ophthalmoscopy; population research; preschool child; prevalence; risk factor; school child; systolic blood pressure; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Wong, T.Y.; Centre for Eye Research Australia, , Melbourne, VIC, Australia; email: ophwty@nus.edu.sg",,,01495992,,DICAD,"22301125","English","Diabetes Care",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859030420

We first determine by spectral analysis the thresholds above which epidemics/failures can spread; we then calculate the slowest diffusional times. Our results shows that disassortative networks exhibit a higher epidemiological threshold and are therefore easier to immunize, while in assortative networks there is a longer time for intervention before epidemic/failure spreads. Moreover, we study by computer simulations the sandpile cascade model, a diffusive model of distress propagation (financial contagion). We show that, while assortative networks are more prone to the propagation of epidemic/failures, degree-targeted immunization policies increases their resilience to systemic risk. © 2012 Europhysics Letters Association.",,,"D'Agostino, G.; ENEA, Via Anguillarese 301, I-00123 Roma, Italy",,,02955075,,,,"English","EPL",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858953552

We show that techniques such as maximum entropy currently used to reconstruct credit networks severely underestimate the risk of contagion by assuming a trivial (fully connected) topology, a type of network structure which can be very different from the one empirically observed. We propose an efficient message-passing algorithm to explore the space of possible network structures and show that a correct estimation of the network degree of connectedness leads to more reliable estimations for systemic risk. Such an algorithm is also able to produce maximally fragile structures, providing a practical upper bound for the risk of contagion when the actual network structure is unknown. We test our algorithm on ensembles of synthetic data encoding some features of real financial networks (sparsity and heterogeneity), finding that more accurate estimations of risk can be achieved. Finally we find that this algorithm can be used to control the amount of information that regulators need to require from banks in order to sufficiently constrain the reconstruction of financial networks. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","financial instruments and regulation; message-passing algorithms; network reconstruction; risk measure and management",,"Mastromatteo, I.; International School for Advanced Studies, via Beirut 2/4, I-34014 Trieste, Italy; email: mastroma@sissa.it",,,17425468,,,,"English","J.

The ocular and systemic risk factors were also reviewed. Methods: Data were obtained retrospectively from patients with massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage who were treated in Worthing and Southlands National Health Service Trust between January 2003 and December 2008. Results: The study included 10 patients (5 women and 5 men) with a mean age of 73.9 years (range, 54-84 years). All patients underwent early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 100% perfluoropropane as a tamponade. The mean interval of drainage from the onset was 3.5 days (range, 1-10 days). Anatomical restoration of ocular structures was achieved in 7 patients, with good final visual outcome at mean 9 months (range, 6-14 months). The remaining three patients had poor visual outcome because of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The most common risk factor in this case series was glaucoma, which was seen in five patients. Arteriosclerosis was the only risk factor in two patients. Conclusion: Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with 100% perfluoropropane tamponade may help in achieving a good visual outcome. The use of 100% perfluoropropane has the advantage of maintaining positive pressure while facilitating controlled drainage of the hemorrhage as the clot lyses. Retinal detachment however is a poor prognostic indicator.

The underlying drivers include advances in transactions and information technologies, regulatory changes, geographic shifts in growth opportunities, and the rapid evolution of client requirements, which in combination have obliged financial firms to rethink their roles as intermediaries. Moreover, financial sector reconfiguration has accelerated as a result of the global market turbulence that began in 2007, with governments either forcing or encouraging combinations of stronger and weaker financial firms in an effort to stem the crisis and improve systemic robustness. In the process, financial firms that are ""systemic"" in nature and had a major role in creating the crisis have come out of it with even larger market shares and greater systemic importance. Given the episodic socialization of risk in the form of widespread use of public guarantees to firms judged too big or too interconnected to be allowed to fail, the role of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) is central to the financial architecture and the public interest going forward. This survey paper considers the sources of systemic gains, losses and risks associated with SIFIs in historical context, in the theoretical and empirical literature, and in public policy discussions-i.e., what is gained and what is lost as a result of the available policy options to deal the dominant role of SIFIs in the financial architecture?. © 2011 Swiss Society for Financial Market Research.","Banking; Financial architecture regulation; Financial institutions; Financial services; Systemic risk",,"Walter, I.; Leonard N.

We study international diversification with two dependence measures: correlations and extreme dependence. We discover that dependence has typically increased over time, and document mixed evidence on heavy tails in individual countries. Moreover, we uncover three additional findings related to dependence. First, the timing of downside risk differs depending on the region. Surprisingly, recent Latin American returns exhibit little downside risk. Second, Latin America exhibits a great deal of correlation complexity. Third, according to the empirical results, correlation does not vary with returns, but extreme dependence does vary monotonically with regional returns. Our results are consistent with a tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk. They also suggest international limits to diversification, and that international investors demand some compensation for joint downside risk during extreme events. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Correlation complexity; Diversification; Downside Risk; Extreme value; Systemic risk",,"Chollete, L.; University of Stavanger, Stavanger N-4036, Norway; email: loran.g.chollete@uis.no",,,03784266,,JBFID,,"English","J.

Although the industrialized economies have stopped contracting, for many, unemployment is still rising. The United States likely hit bottom in June 2009, but numerous small banks and households still face huge problems in restoring their balance sheets, and unemployment has combined with sub-prime loans to keep home foreclosures at a high rate. Nearly all industrialized countries and many emerging and developing nations have announced economic stimulus and/or financial sector rescue packages, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). Several countries have resorted to borrowing from the International Monetary Fund as a last resort. The crisis has exposed fundamental weaknesses in financial systems worldwide, demonstrated how interconnected and interdependent economies are today, and has posed vexing policy dilemmas. The process for coping with the crisis by countries across the globe has been manifest in four basic phases. The first has been intervention to contain the contagion and restore confidence in the system. This has required extraordinary measures both in scope, cost, and extent of government reach. The second has been coping with the secondary effects of the crisis, particularly the global recession and flight of capital from countries in emerging markets and elsewhere that have been affected by the crisis. The third phase of this process is to make changes in the financial system to reduce risk and prevent future crises. In order to give these proposals political backing, world leaders have called for international meetings to address changes in policy, regulations, oversight, and enforcement. On September 24-25, 2009, heads of the G-20 nations met in Pittsburgh to address the global financial crisis. The fourth phase of the process is dealing with political, social, and security effects of the financial turmoil. One such effect is the strengthened role of China in financial markets. The role for Congress in this financial crisis is multifaceted. While the recent focus has been on combating the recession, the ultimate issue perhaps is how to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of financial markets to promote the general well-being of the country while protecting taxpayer interests and facilitating business operations without creating a moral hazard. In addition to preventing future crises through legislative, oversight, and domestic regulatory functions, On June 17, 2009, the Department of the Treasury presented the Obama Administration proposal for financial regulatory reform. The proposal focuses on five areas and includes establishing the Federal Reserve as a systemic risk regulator, creating a Council of Regulators, regulating all financial derivatives, creating a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, improving coordination and oversight of international financial markets, and other provisions. Treasury also has submitted to Congress proposed legislation to implement the reforms. The reform agenda now has moved to Congress. Legislation in Congress addresses many of the issues in the Treasury plan but also may focus on other financial issues. Congress also plays a role in measures to reform and recapitalize the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and regional development banks. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to determine the presentation, systemic and local predisposing factors, management challenges and outcome in south-eastern Nigeria. Patients and methods: We studied 28 out of 34 consecutive male patients with complete case notes seen in two centres (the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital and St Mary's Hospital) between January 1995 and December 2008. Operating theatre registers and urology ward admission registers were used to identify patients. Results: The mean patient age was 48.3 years (range 28-66 years), with a peak age incidence of 50-59 years. The majority of patients were farmers, manual labourers and artisans. The site of gangrene was scrotal in 22 patients (78.6%), penoscrotal in 3 (10.7%), abdominoscrotal in 2 (7.1%) and scroto-perianal in 1 (3.6%). The mean interval between onset of symptoms and presentation was 7.2 days (range 3-14 days). Systemic predisposing factors identified were diabetes mellitus in 6 patients (21.4%), filariasis in 2 (7.2%), congestive cardiac failure in 1 (3.6%) and HIV infection in 1 (3.6%). In 18 patients (64.3%) no systemic factor was identified. Local predisposing factors identified were chronic scrotal skin itching in 16 patients (57.1%), scrotal thorn injury in 2 (7.1%) and urethral catheterisation in 2 (7.1%). Scrotal carbuncle and scrotal surgery each accounted for 2 patients (7.1%), and zipper injury and ischiorectal abscess occurred in 1 patient each (3.6%). No local predisposing factor was identified in 1 patient (3.6%). The common clinical features were fever, scrotal swelling/pain, and later a malodorous painless wound. Treatment involved fluid administration, correction of electrolyte imbalance, antibiotics, debridement and daily wound inspection/dressing with hydrogen peroxide soaks and sodium hypochlorite. The mean duration of hospital stay was 37.1.days (range 21-84 days). One patient died (3.6%). Conclusion: Fournier's gangrene is a challenging surgical problem, with significant morbidity. Diabetes mellitus is a significant systemic risk factor. In the majority of our cases, no systemic predisposing factor was identified. Local risk factors, especially chronic scrotal itching, were contributory. With proper management, mortality is low.",,"adult; aged; article; Fournier gangrene; human; male; middle aged; Nigeria; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Fournier Gangrene; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome","Ugwumba, F.O.; Urology Unit, , Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria",,,00382361,,SAJSB,"22353315","English","S.

Whereas previous studies of contagion effects in financial networks have relied on large scale simulations, our approach uses a simple analytical criterion for resilience to contagion, based on an asymptotic analysis of default cascades in heterogeneous networks. In particular, our methodology does not require to observe the whole network but focuses on the characteristics of the network which contribute to its resilience. Applying this framework to a sample network, we observe that the size of the default cascade generated by a macroeconomic shock across balance sheets may exhibit a sharp transition when the magnitude of the shock reaches a certain threshold: Beyond this threshold, contagion spreads to a large fraction of the financial system. An upper bound is given for the threshold in terms of the characteristics of the network. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","default risk; macro-prudential regulation; random graphs; stress test; Systemic risk",,"Amini, H.; INRIA RocquencourtFrance; email: Hamed.Amini@ens.fr",,,02190249,,,,"English","Int.

A first family of approaches defines stability in opposition to the concept of financial instability while referring to the lesson of the various episodes of last crises. A second approach introduced primarily by the central banks tries to define this concept starting from the various properties of a stable financial system. However, the formulation of an operational definition remains conditioned by the installation of an analytical framework which must delimit the field of intervention of the responsible authorities, define the instruments and the transmission channels of the adopted decisions and specify the indicator of measurement making it possible to evaluate this function. The traditional functions of the central banks such as the management of the liquidity, the banking supervision and the control of the monetary policy confer to them a central role in the maintenance of financial stability. In the same way, their interventions successful at the time of financial crises enabled them to acquire an expertise on the matter. Thus, one attends an increased role of the central banks in this field, according to various methods and within devices associating generally various actors (Government and regulation and supervision authority). © Euro Journals Publishing, Inc. 2012.","Financial regulation and bank run; Financial stability; Macro stress test; Systemic risk",,"Mohamed, A.; University of Mohammed V Agdal, Morocco; email: Abouch_m@yahoo.fr",,,14502887,,,,"English","Int.

Based on China's emission abatement target, this paper first analyzes enterprises' emission reduction pathways in practical production processes, and then develops a framework to derive the magnitude of investment required in each pathway in order to achieve the designated target at the minimal cost. Under the framework, it is found that in the absence of policy guidance, individual enterprises' emission reduction investments deviate from the optimal level. To correct the distortion, an alternative option is provided. Meanwhile, to ensure achievement of the emission reduction target, a stochastic model is introduced to measure the uncertainty arising from emission abatement investment.

Therefore, this paper examines the typology of networks representing industrial areas to formulate recommendations to more effectively protect a chemical cluster against existing systemic risks. Chemical industrial areas are modeled as two distinct complex networks and are prioritized by computing two sub-indices with respect to existing systemic safety and security risks (using Domino Danger Units) and supply chain risks (using units from an ordinal expert scale). Subsequently, a Systemic Risk Index for the industrial area is determined employing the Borda algorithm, whereby the systemic risk index considers both a safety and security network risk index and a supply chain network risk index. The developed method allows decreasing systemic risks within chemical industrial areas from a holistic (inter-organizational and/or inter-cluster) perspective.

Also in July 2008, most commentators were sceptical when asked whether there was at all a future for the old Bretton Woods System, in particular the IMF and its lending policy. Many countries, which only some years ago were dependent on support from the IMF, had announced to repay their facilities and stop co-operating with the Washington based international organisation, a fact which the author mentions shortly (p. 98). But, when the financial crisis hit Iceland, to name only one country affected, the IMF was back in business – which it is now eagerly defending. In the future, the question will be if the IMF can establish itself successfully as a global macroeconomic supervisor watching out to warn against the rise of systemic risks and global imbalances. It is the same logic when political leaders and academia discuss the role the various international fora around the G20 process will play and how they should be put into effective co-operation rather than left in isolated co-existence. Maybe, the biggest flaw of the past was that we (and not only they) all concentrated on our undoubtedly relevant but, narrow mandate (or academic interests), thereby neglecting the complex interplay between trade and finance. This is also the field where the mandate of WTO and IMF could be mutually strengthened in the future. © 2012, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bretton Wood System; Current Account Deficit; Financial Turmoil; Global Imbalance; Lending Policy",,"Ohler, C.; Rechtswissenschaftliche Fakultät, Germany; email: christoph.ohler@recht.uni-jena.de",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23648392,,,,"English","Eur.

The first concern was about the explanatory power of each model and compared the effects of economic variables, and the second was to examine the occurrence of structural changes, and which periods impacted the behavior of the coefficients. The analysis was conducted on daily data of indexes representing stocks traded on the Bovespa during the period from 1st December 2005 to October 31, 2008 (721 observations). To have a minimum number of observations and estimate consistently the parameters of the regression models and so that the Newey-West correction could correct the problem of inefficiency of the coefficients violated when the classical assumptions of absence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity waste in some cases, had to consider breaks that were statistically more significant through the control of the monitoring period. Thus, after applying the tests to verify hypotheses classical OLS, it was found that the model chosen was the conditional CAPM, showing small Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Schwarz (BIC) without the presence of structural break. When considering the presence of structural breaks in time series, there were changes in systemic risk and total over the period observed. From these results, it is recommended to investigate the possible events that led to disruption in the series, noting the factors that contributed to such interference. © 2012 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

Since the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) proposed by Sharpe (1964), such models linearly relate the expected rate of returns of an asset or portfolio of assets with systemic risk factors. This research presents a test of a pricing model with risk factors based on statistical comoments and using a Brazilian dataset. The proposed model is an extension of the original CAPM with the addition of coskewness and cokurtosis between stock rates of return and the market portfolio rates of return. The effects of other variables such as market to book value, financial leverage and a negotiability index served as control variables. The sample consisted of 179 non-financial Brazilian companies traded on BM&FBovespa with data available from 2003 to 2007. Annual systemic moments were calculated from weekly rates of return. They were then tested on a pricing model in order to check for the existence of a risk premium associated with each of these risk measures. We employed a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) panel data analysis. The use of GMM aims to address potential problems of endogeneity and simultaneous determination of the data, avoiding the occurrence of bias in the estimates. The estimation results show that the relationship between rates of return and covariance and cokurtosis are statistically significant. The results were robust to alternative model specifications. This research contributes to the literature by presenting empirical evidence that there is a Brazilian risk premium associated with systemic moments. © 2012 Mackenzie Presbyterian University.

When equity and real estate markets capture the creation of global wealth, derivatives markets make it possible to value and transfer risk. Hedging and speculation are the main motivations of the participants who buy and sell the numerous products traded in these markets. Following Robert Shiller’s writings, this chapter aims to show that these markets, whether organized or not, may provide new ways to manage most of the risks both firms and individuals are facing. However, at the same time, huge risk transfers may foster speculation and lead to new systemic risks, as revealed by the credit derivatives market in recent years. This paper considers how the financial markets can better serve people (individuals, long investors, funds) in the context of the current economic situation. Firstly, the paper characterizes the risks individuals are facing and to what extent they can be measured and hedged through the financial markets. Then, examples of risk transfer are shown using the example of the real estate market. The role of information required to construct relevant indices that can be used as underlying assets is also highlighted.

In the same crisis, several distressed banks were bailed out by states with even more banks receiving financial aids from governments. Using a unique data sample of 100 announcements of US mortgage banks between 2006 and 2009, this paper provides empirical evidence that isolated failures of US mortgage banks caused significant contagion effects in the US financial system. Conversely, especially the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led to significant positive valuation effects at rival banks. In the cross-sectional analyses, contrary to previous studies in the literature on past financial crises, we find evidence for pure contagion effects following the failures of US mortgage banks. Furthermore, we analyze the reactions of the CDS spreads of several large US banks to the announcements of mortgage banks using a novel mixture copula model. The results show that the contagion effects were limited to the stock market thus underlining the notion of an irrational response of (stock) market participants. The results from our cross-sectional and CDS data analyses in turn indicate that several of the failures of US mortgage banks during the subprime crisis caused irrational contagion in the US financial system thus justifying government intervention. Finally, we rule out the possibility that the contagion effects limited to the US stock market were caused by a herding of investors. © Springer Gabler | Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.","Bailout; Contagion; Mortgage bank; Subprime crisis",,"Weiß, G.N.F.; Technische Universität DortmundGermany; email: gregor.weiss@tu-dortmund.de",,"Gabler Verlag",,9783834938640; 9783834934499,,,"English","Real Estate Finance",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027321957

The paper shows that though the Indian workforce is largely informal, there are indications of further flexibilisation of employment relations, leading to greater mobility and informalisation. In the recent past, the Indian State has conceded some space to rights-based social protection measures. This has led to an increased financial allocation by the Central Government to areas of social protection which have come within the ambit of rights. However, the paper shows that the relative importance of these measures for the population as a whole, in terms of their financing by the Centre and the states taken together, has been much less remarkable. On minimum conditions of work and rights at work, the paper notes that there has been very little progress in recent years. While examining the major social security programmes, including social security programmes emerging out of the NCEUS proposals, the paper again finds an increase in recent years, particularly in the programmes for employment creation and food security. However, the total expenditure on protective social security remains small. The paper also examines the earlier NCEUS proposals on social security and suggests a modified package for reconsideration. It may be mentioned that currently the National Advisory Council (NAC) to the Government is considering fresh proposals for universal protective social security. Hence, it is important to re-examine the NCEUS proposals and the Government schemes in this context. © 2012, Springer India.

This chapter discusses and reassesses the principal challenges and proposals for the reform of international financial regulation, commenting upon some specific lessons for the Spanish case from recent empirical evidence. From an international perspective, consensus is broadest that the most appropriate way to avoid systemic risk escaping from the perimeter of regulation and generating shadow banking is coordination at the national/international level and prompt corrective action, which in the EU has led to a combination of both microprudential and macroprudential policies (contained in the Larosière Report). From a national perspective, the chapter provides empirical evidence suggesting the existence of a relation ship between excessive credit expansion in the years prior to the crisis and the current problems of asset impairment. It can be observed that the greater demands of prudential supervision and the dynamic provisions of the Bank of Spain have so far been able to attenuate only part of the effects of asset impairment. Nevertheless, some further adjustment is still required, in the framework of the orderly restructuring of the banking sector, and this is highly likely to generate an intensive process of financial consolidation. © Robert R.

Whereas previous studies of contagion effects in financial networks have relied on large scale simulations, our approach uses a simple analytical criterion for resilience to contagion, based on an asymptotic analysis of default cascades in heterogeneous networks. In particular, our methodology does not require to observe the whole network but focuses on the characteristics of the network which contribute to its resilience. Applying this framework to a sample network, we observe that the size of the default cascade generated by a macroeconomic shock across balance sheets may exhibit a sharp transition when the magnitude of the shock reaches a certain threshold: Beyond this threshold, contagion spreads to a large fraction of the financial system. An upper bound is given for the threshold in terms of the characteristics of the network. © 2013 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

It has sharply increased reserves to the banking system through open market operations and lowered the federal funds rate and discount rate on several occasions. Since December 2008, it has allowed the federal funds rate to fall close to zero. As the crisis deepened, the Fed's focus shifted to providing liquidity directly to the financial system through new policy tools. Through new credit facilities, the Fed first expanded the scale of its lending to the banking system and then extended direct lending to non-bank financial firms. The latter marked the first time since the Great Depression that firms that are not banks or members of the Federal Reserve System have been allowed to borrow directly from the Fed. After the crisis worsened in September 2008, the Fed began providing credit directly to markets for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. All of these emergency facilities had expired by the end of June 2010, but central bank liquidity swap lines were reopened in May 2010 in response to the crisis in Greece. The Fed also provided emergency assistance to Bear Stearns, AIG, and Citigroup over the course of the crisis; the Fed still holds assets from and loans to AIG and assets from Bear Stearns. These programs resulted in an increase in the Fed's balance sheet of $1.4 trillion at its peak in December 2008, staying relatively steady since then. The Fed's authority and capacity to lend is bound only by fears of the inflationary consequences, which have been partly offset by additional debt issuance by the Treasury. High inflation has not materialized yet because most of the liquidity created by the Fed is being held by banks as excess reserves, but after the economy stabilizes, the Fed may have to scale back its balance sheet rapidly to avoid it. Asset sales could be disruptive, but the Fed has argued that it can contain inflationary pressures through the payment of interest on bank reserves, which it was authorized by Congress to do in 2008. The statutory authority for most of the Fed's recent actions is based on a clause in the Federal Reserve Act to be used in ""unusual or exigent circumstances."" All loans are backed by collateral that reduces the risk of losses. Any losses borne by the Fed from its loans or asset purchases would reduce the income it remits to the Treasury, making the effect on the federal budget similar to if the loans were made directly by Treasury. It is highly unlikely that losses would exceed its other income and capital, and require revenues to be transferred to the Fed from the Treasury. To date, the Fed's crisis activities have increased its net income. Two policy issues raised by the Fed's actions are issues of systemic risk and moral hazard. Moral hazard refers to the phenomenon where actors take on more risk because they are protected. The Fed's involvement in stabilizing Bear Stearns, AIG, and Citigroup stemmed from the fear of systemic risk (that the financial system as a whole would cease to function) if they were allowed to fail. In other words, the firms were seen as ""too big (or too interconnected) to fail."" The Fed regulates member banks to mitigate the moral hazard that stems from access to government protections. Yet Bear Stearns and AIG were not under the Fed's regulatory oversight because they were not member banks. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern that certain details of the Fed's lending activities are kept confidential. H.R. 4173 adds conditions to the Fed's emergency lending authority, removes most GAO audit restrictions, and requires disclosure of the identities of borrowers with a delay. It also changes the Fed's role in the financial regulatory system. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Labonte, M.",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781621005827,,,"English","Financ.

The council is charged with monitoring systemic risk in the financial system and coordinating several federal financial regulators. Because the agency is new and because several potential risks remain to the financial system as a whole, the 112th Congress may wish to monitor the performance, rulemaking, and policy recommendations of the council. This report describes the mission, membership, and scope of the FSOC. It provides an analysis of several major policy issues related to the FSOC that may come before the 112th Congress. The DFA establishes a regulatory framework of which the FSOC is a consultative council. The new regulatory regime incorporates several policy tools to address systemic risk. The FSOC facilitates communication among financial regulators, collects and evaluates financial data to monitor systemic risk, and designates which financial institutions and financial market utilities will be subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve. Upon a determination of a threat to financial stability, a covered nonbank financial institution in danger of failing may under certain conditions be resolved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), rather than through the bankruptcy process. The FSOC may under certain circumstances set aside some financial regulations for consumers if the rules create systemic risk. The DFA directed financial regulators to issue new regulations to mitigate systemic risk and required regulators to study other areas of concern. Examples include proposed or final rules for financial derivatives, clearinghouses, retained risk, and financial market utilities. The DFA mandates more than 80 studies and reports, including the potential use of contingent capital and reliance on the bankruptcy process as a resolution regime. The Office of Financial Research (OFR), created to support the work of the FSOC, has contributed to the first annual report by the FSOC. The OFR assessed a number of areas of concern, including the European sovereign debt crisis, continuing weakness in housing markets, and potential illiquidity in municipal finance. This report is intended to be used as a reference by congressional staff working on financial issues. The macroeconomic policy rationales for various financial crisis-related issues are summarized, and a glossary is provided to assist in understanding technical terms.

How and why do such disasters happen? Are the fatalities caused by relentless behavior of people or a psychological state of panic that makes the crowd ‘go mad’? Or are they a tragic consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other questions are addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available videos and materials, which document the planning and organization of the Love Parade in Duisburg, Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our analysis reveals a number of misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also provide a new perspective on concepts such as ‘intentional pushing’, ‘mass panic’, ‘stampede’, and ‘crowd crushes’. The focus of our analysis is on the contributing causal factors and their mutual interdependencies, not on legal issues or the judgment of personal or institutional responsibilities. Video recordings show that people stumbled and piled up due to a ‘domino effect’, resulting from a phenomenon called ‘crowd turbulence’ or ‘crowd quake’. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be distinguished from crowd disasters resulting from ‘mass panic’ or ‘crowd crushes’. In Duisburg, crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying feedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities. Accordingly, things can go terribly wrong in spite of no bad intentions from anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg with others, we give recommendations to help prevent future crowd disasters. In particular, we introduce a new scale to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd. This may allow preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering that today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web. © 2012 Helbing and Mukerji; licensee Springer.","Cascading effect; Causality network; Crowd control; Crowd disaster; Crowd quake; Domino effect; Evacuation; Instability; Systemic risk","Disasters; Earthquakes; Failure (mechanical); Plasma stability; Turbulence; Video recording; Cascading effects; Crowd control; Crowd disaster; Crowd quake; Domino effects; Evacuation; Systemic risks; Disaster prevention","Helbing, D.; Risk Center, Scheuchzerstrasse 7, Switzerland; email: dhelbing@ethz.ch",,"SpringerOpen",21931127,,,,"English","EPJ Data Sci.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933502418

The lesson some policymakers have taken from this crisis is that a systemic risk or ""macroprudential"" regulator is needed to prevent similar episodes in the future. But what types of risk would this new regulator be tasked with preventing, and is it the case that those activities are currently unsupervised? Some of the major financial market phenomena that have been identified as posing systemic risk include liquidity problems; ""too big to fail"" or ""systemically important"" firms; the cycle of rising leverage followed by rapid deleverage; weaknesses in payment, settlement, and clearing systems; and asset bubbles. The Federal Reserve (Fed) already regulates bank holding companies and financial holding companies for capital and liquidity requirements, and it can advise their behavior in markets that it does not regulate. In addition, the Fed directly regulates or operates in some payment, settlement, and clearing systems. Many too big to fail firms are already regulated by the Fed because they are banks, although some may exist in what is referred to as the shadow banking system, which is largely free of federal regulation for safety and soundness. The Fed's monetary policy mandate is broad enough to allow it to use monetary policy to prick asset bubbles, although it has not chosen to do so in the past. Neither the Fed nor other existing regulators have the authority to identify and address gaps in existing regulation that they believe pose systemic risk. Opponents of a systemic risk regulator argue that regulators did not fail to prevent the crisis because they lacked the necessary authority, but because they used their authority poorly and failed to identify systemic risk until it was too late. They fear that greater government regulation of financial markets will lead to moral hazard problems that increase systemic risk. On the other hand, the current crisis has demonstrated that government intervention may become unavoidable, even when firms or markets are not explicitly regulated or protected by the government. If policymakers choose to create a systemic risk regulator, those duties could be given to the Fed or a new or existing regulator in the executive branch. The Fed's political independence has been used as an argument for and against giving it systemic risk regulatory responsibilities. Another consideration is that the Fed's existing responsibilities already have some overlap with systemic risk regulation. These responsibilities include a statutory mandate to maintain full employment and stable prices and the role of lender of last resort, as well as being the institution with the broadest existing financial regulatory powers. The Financial Stability Improvement Act of 2009 (H.R. 4173) passed the House on December 11, 2009. The Restoring American Financial Stability Act (S. 3217) passed the Senate on May 20, 2010. Provisions of these bills involving the Federal Reserve and systemic risk are discussed in this report, including the creation of a Financial Services (Stability) Oversight Council and the regulation of systemically significant firms by the Fed. Neither bill creates a ""systemic risk regulator""; nonetheless, many of the potential duties that could be assigned to a systemic risk regulator discussed in this report are included in both bills. The bills spread these duties among multiple regulators, although many of the important ones are assigned to the Fed. Although this could be portrayed as an expansion of the Fed's powers, the bills also strip the Fed of certain powers and creates new checks on other powers. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These financial derivatives are often used by banks and other financial institutions to manage risk. The near-collapse of AIG and subsequent firm-specific government assistance in September 2008, largely as a result of an AIG unit's extensive issuance of credit default swaps, drew attention to the unregulated nature of these instruments. Government assistance to AIG- which has totaled roughly $180 billion-came against a backdrop of rapid growth of the derivatives market, rising credit defaults on mortgages and related mortgage-backed securities, and operational problems in the over-the-counter (OTC) market where credit default swaps are traded. The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 also raised systemic risk concerns due to Lehman's heavy involvement in the credit default swaps market, both as a major seller of credit default protection, and as an actively traded underlying entity on which such credit protection was written. The lack of any record-keeping or reporting requirements in the CDS market further aggravated problems regulators faced in gauging the potential systemic impact these companies' failures could have on the economy as a whole. This state of affairs led a number of policymakers to inquire whether credit default swaps pose a danger to the financial system and the economy. This report defines credit default swaps, explains their use by banks for risk management, and discusses how they may have contributed to systemic risk. It also examines legislative proposals to address risks from credit default swaps. Among the bills to regulate credit default swaps and other derivatives is H.R. 4173, in its Title III section on over-the-counter derivatives, which passed the House of Representatives with various amendments on December 11, 2009. In the Senate, the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs has released a committee print draft of a comprehensive financial reform bill that includes legislation to reform OTC derivatives. Senator Jack Reed, who chairs the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment has introduced S. 1691 to regulate the OTC derivatives markets, including CDS. Senator Blanche Lincoln, the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which shares jurisdiction over derivatives with the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, has also indicated an intention to introduce legislation reforming regulation of OTC derivatives. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The starting point for this chapter is to ask why bank depositors should receive special treatment when the bank in which they have deposited their savings fails. The rationales for depositor protection are many but two are particularly relevant for the purposes of this chapter. First, providing protection to depositors is thought to reduce the problem of systemic risk by ensuring that financial difficulties at one bank do not easily spread to other banks. The second rationale for providing protection to bank depositors is to protect individual consumers. It has been suggested by Macdonald that protecting individual consumers is the direct rationale for a deposit protection system and that the reduction of systemic risk is the indirect rationale. The European approach has typically been to view the subject primarily from a consumer protection perspective whereas in the United States the protection of individual depositors is seen as a by-product of a system which exists primarily for the protection of the banking system. Banks and risk Banks depend on confidence, and should depositors start a run on a bank it can quickly become unstable even though immediately prior to the run the bank was in a perfectly healthy position and meeting all of its regulatory requirements. This is because deposit taking banks operate on the basis of fractional reserves and use a business model in which the bank traditionally ‘borrows short’ and ‘lends long’. What this means is that when a bank takes a deposit from a customer it actually borrows this money and in order to make a return on this it will seek to lend or invest as much of this as it is permitted to do by law. In effect this means that most of the money which has been deposited in the bank will not be in a liquid state and therefore the bank will only be able to meet requests for withdrawals from customers in the normal course of business. This will not normally be problematic, as new deposits will be made by some customers while others are making withdrawals. A relatively small percentage of the total deposit book held in cash, or in assets which can quickly be turned into cash, will in the normal course of business be sufficient to meet customer demand for withdrawals. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139003469; 9781107013025,,,"English","Consumer Credit, Debt and Invest. in Europe",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924104047

This is a fundamental question for financial regulation, but it is not readily answerable as the issues implicated are truly complex, if not intractable. Yet foundational financial legislation tends to be enacted in a crisis setting (Romano 2005:1591-94), and over the past decade, when confronted with this question, the U.S. Congress has answered it reflexively by enacting legislation that massively increases the scope and scale of the regulation of business firms, especially financial institutions and instruments, in a manner seemingly oblivious to the cost and consequences of its actions. A simple but telling comparison of a commonly used measure of legislative complexity, a statute's published length, conveys what Congress has wrought. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is sixty-six pages long and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 is an astounding 848 pages, whereas the twentiethcentury foundational federal banking legislation-the Federal Reserve Act and the Glass-Steagall Act-are twenty-four and thirty-seven pages, respectively (Perry 2010). In addressing how to regulate in a financial crisis, there is a related question: whether there is something about financial institutions and markets that is different from other regulatory domains, which makes regulation more challenging and crisis responses more prone to legislative failure. This chapter addresses both questions by contrasting three recent examples of financial regulation that, I contend, are, in the main, misguided: Sarbanes-Oxley, the response to the accounting scandals and bankruptcies of several large public corporations accompanied by a sharp stock market decline in the early 2000s; Dodd-Frank, the response to the global financial crisis originating in the subprime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s; and the Basel capital accords, through which central banks and banking regulators of the leading industrial nations have sought to harmonize international financial regulation since the late 1980s. The answer to the two questions regarding crisis-generated financial regulation is, I believe, not really an issue of institutional competence-that is, of Congress's lack of the requisite expertise to understand technically complicated financial products and markets. After all, financial regulators, in promulgating permutations of internationally harmonized capital requirements, have not fared much better in protecting the global financial system from catastrophic systemic risk and, I would contend, have contributed to it, albeit unintentionally-though one would have a hard time figuring that out from media accounts (Romano 2012). Rather, the nub of the regulatory problem derives from the fact that financial firms operate in a dynamic environment in which there are many unknowns and unknowables and state-of-the-art knowledge quickly obsolesces. In such a context, even the most informed regulatory response-which Congress's reaction in the recent crises was not-will be prone to error and is likely to produce backward-looking regulation that takes aim at yesterday's perceived problem, rather than tomorrow's, for regulators necessarily operate under considerable uncertainty and at a lag behind private actors. But using market actors' superior knowledge to inform regulation is not necessarily an effective solution either, as indicated by the utter failure in the recent crisis of Basel II, which relied on banks' internal risk ratings to mea sure capital requirements. This only further highlights the fluid, fast-moving, and uncertain environment in which financial institutions operate-even firms' state-of-the-art risk management techniques proved inadequate in the confluence of events that produced the global financial crisis. In order to understand financial regulation undertaken in a crisis, we need to take account, as Frank Knight (1965:270) put it, of ""human nature as we know it."" Human nature in this context is that legislators will find it impossible to not respond to a financial crisis by ""doing something,"" that is, by ratcheting up regulation, instead of waiting until a consensus understanding of what has occurred can be secured and a targeted solution then crafted, despite the considerable informational advantage from the latter approach, which would, no doubt, improve the quality of decision making (see Carrigan and Coglianese this volume). Compounding the problem, Congress tends not to move nimbly to rework financial legislation when it becomes widely acknowledged as flawed or seriously deficient. For instance, it took decades to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of commercial and investment banking; eleven years to make relatively small revisions to accounting and bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and eight years to amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to exempt only the smallest firms from the auditor attestation of internal controls' effectiveness requirement, despite substantial consensus regarding the statutes' problems. In this chapter, I contend that the best means of responding to the typical pattern of financial regulation-legislating in a crisis atmosphere under conditions of substantial uncertainty followed by status quo stickiness-is for Congress and regulators to include as a matter of course in financial legislation and regulation enacted in the midst or aftermath of a financial crisis procedural mechanisms that require automatic subsequent review and reconsideration of those decisions, along with regulatory exemption or waiver powers that create flexibility in implementation and encourage, where possible, small-scale, discrete experimentation to better inform and calibrate the regulatory apparatus. Such an approach, in my judgment, could mitigate, at least at the margin, errors that invariably accompany financial legislation and rulemaking originating in a crisis atmosphere. Given the fragility of financial institutions and markets and their centrality to economic growth and societal wellbeing, this is an area in which it is exceedingly important for legislators acting in a crisis with the best of intentions to keep from making matters worse. © 2012 University of Pennsylvania Press.

The model is analysed by means of numerical simulations and systemic risk modelling, where local interaction of units is captured and analysed by the bilateral provision of liquidity among units.

However, academics, non-governmental organizations, and market participants have criticized carbon offset mechanisms' economic inefficiency and dubious environmental benefits. This Article traces these criticisms to the microeconomic structure of the offset market. Offsets were envisioned as a way to use self-regulating market forces to stimulate investment in emissions mitigation projects efficiently, but tradable property rights are inherently ill-suited to that task. Consequently, policymakers ended up designing a Rube Goldberg-esque scheme that is neither efficient nor self-regulating. The financial intermediation industry through which offsets are certified and traded consumes approximately thirty percent of all carbon offset funding, such that less than seventy cents out of each dollar invested in international greenhouse gas mitigation reaches its target. At the same time, the private sector-led system inappropriately cabins the authority of public sector regulators-the only market participants with an incentive to ensure the environmental quality of the assets exchanged. Systemic risk is also a concern: the offset mechanism's substitution of abstract, tradable securities for simpler contract-based lending bears an uncanny resemblance to developments in the securitized mortgage lending industry prior to the 2008 crisis. Direct subsidies issued to emissions-reducing projects by a publicly-administered fund could likely achieve better environmental outcomes at lower cost.",,"carbon emission; climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; mitigation; nongovernmental organization; property rights","McNish, T.",,"Harvard University",01478257,,,,"English","Harv.

Large, complex or interconnected banks, with the notable exception of Lehman Brothers in October 2008, were bailed out and/or merged with other banks because of the systemic risks they posed. They were judged too important to be allowed to fail, or ‘too big to fail’ (TBTF). Many banks, including large ones (e.g., Merrill Lynch, an investment bank, and Washington Mutual, WaMu, a mortgage lender) were merged with others (Bank of America in these cases) to form even bigger banks, despite a regulatory rule that no bank in the US should have more than a 10 per cent market share. Concentration in banking in the US and elsewhere has thus increased. Bank bondholders (including providers of Tier 2 and some Tier 1 capital - see www.bis.org) have generally been protected (except in cases such as Lehman’s and WaMu) and, post-Lehman, bank bond issuance has been guaranteed by governments in the EU and the US, and more widely. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the US has been able to allow numerous (non-TBTF) banks to fail under its bank resolution arrangements, with the protected deposits transferred to other banks promptly. In addition, the US deposit insurance (DI) cover was raised from US$100 000 to US$250 000 to reassure depositors. DI was effectively extended by the Fed (the Federal Reserve System, the US central banking…. © James R.

Although the chapter was written largely before the adoption of EU bank regulatory reforms in 2011, its main critique that EU bank regulation fails to provide an adequate balance between a common rule-book and common principles remains steadfast, especially in light of the lack of a structured early intervention regime for EU-based banking groups that operate on a cross-border basis. These banking organisations often pose systemic risks across EU jurisdictions and also have depositors in many European states. In addressing these risks, Mayes suggests that a common rule book with trigger points for supervisory intervention may be more eff ective for overseeing cross-border banking groups than primary reliance on common principles of action. While the chapter recognises that both common rules and common principles are important, a common rule book for structured early supervisory intervention is more appropriate for coordinating eff ective oversight of the cross-border operations of European banking groups. For PCA to work on a cross-border basis in Europe, however, it may be necessary to have further institutional consolidation at the European level to improve the oversight of European banks that operate in more than one jurisdiction or which pose systemic risk in more than one EEA state. © Kern Alexander and Rahul Dhumale 2012.

These proposals are designed in substantial part to control systemic risk in wholesale capital markets and in particular in the OTC derivatives markets, which was a source of the systemic risk that toppled Lehman Brothers in 2008 and nearly caused the collapse of the European and US fi nancial systems. The chapter also draws some comparisons with the US Dodd-Frank Act's requirements for centralised clearing and suggests that EMIR has in key areas diff erent prudential regulatory requirements for CCPs than the US regulators have proposed so far and therefore could potentially create market access problems for CCPs based in the US and other third countries seeking access to the EU market. But the EU and US legislation and regulations are not yet fi nalised at the time of publication and future convergence remains possible.

His analysis incorporates not only the views of EU and US regulatory officials, but also draws on the reports of professional and industry bodies.

In this article, the authors explore systemic risk in privatized service implementation networks. Reliance on networks of private agents for service production contributes to the disarticulated and fragmented state and increases the potential for systemic crisis if shocks to the network occur, putting vulnerable clients at risk. Government must focus on understanding systemic risk in networked governance arrangements and building resilient networks to avoid crises, the authors argue. Finally, potential research on systemic risk in networked governance arrangements is discussed.

Trading in derivatives might offer an alternative to traditional deposit-taking and lending business as a source of revenue and profit; or it might enable banks to increase their lending more rapidly, through improved risk management. A simultaneous equations model is developed for the growth in commercial and industrial lending, and the use of derivatives. Lending by derivatives users grew more slowly on average, and the likelihood of using derivatives was inversely related to the growth of lending. This suggests the use of derivatives was a substitute for traditional lending business. Dealing in derivatives creates new forms of systemic risk through complex and opaque patterns of exposure. The empirical results suggest a continuing need for careful regulatory oversight, and more transparent disclosure of banks' derivatives exposures.

Diabetic retinopathy has a significant impact on public health and the quality of life of many patients and thus requires serious consideration. The first line of treatment remains the management of systemic risk factors but this is often insufficient in controlling DME and currently, laser retinal photocoagulation is considered the standard of care. However, laser treatment reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50 % without guaranteeing remarkable effects on visual improvement. For these reasons, new approaches in the treatment of DME have been considered, in particular the employment of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs. VEGF is a pluripotent growth factor that functions as a vasopermeability factor and an endothelial cell mitogen and thereby represents an appealing candidate as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DME. The goal of this article is to present the evidence behind the use of anti-VEGF drugs in the treatment of DME. © TOUCH BRIEFINGS 2012.","Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor Trap-Eye; Bevacizumab; Bevasiranib; Diabetic macular oedema; Pegaptanib; Ranibizumab; Rapamycin","aflibercept; bevacizumab; bevasiranib; pegaptanib; placebo; ranibizumab; rapamycin; regeneron; triamcinolone; triamcinolone acetonide; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; vasculotropin inhibitor; absence of side effects; article; blood vessel permeability; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; conjunctival hemorrhage; diabetes mellitus; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; dosage schedule comparison; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug safety; drug targeting; endophthalmitis; endothelium cell; eye discharge; eye pain; human; intermethod comparison; intraocular pressure; laser coagulation; multicenter study (topic); open study; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); retinal thickness; risk factor; risk management; risk reduction; side effect; treatment outcome; visual acuity; vitrectomy; vitreous floaters; vitreous hemorrhage","Bandello, F.; Department of Ophthalmology, Via Olgettina 60, 20132 Milan, Italy; email: bandello.francesco@hsr.it",,"Touch Briefings",17583772,,,,"English","Eur.

This paper focuses in particular on the recent judgments of the Polish and Czech constitutional courts. One might perceive a general tendency in the process of EU integration for EU policies to be increasingly dominated by national agendas. As a result, EU policies might be held hostage by the interests of the stronger Member States. These tendencies increase the tensions inherent in the pluralist structure of the relationships between legal orders in the European arena. Constitutional identity is yet another concept used in this debate about ultimate authority. Pluralism assumes that the courts will compete over ultimate authority and will try to use such a concept 'to their advantage'. With regard to article 4 (2) TEU, the ECJ seems to have more persuasive power than the Polish and the Czech constitutional courts. However, the jurisprudence is certainly not settled yet. The interweaving of national, European and international law creates the need to examine constitutional identity expressed inside and outside the EU. Pure heterarchy based on a balance of powers and protection of national constitutions as well as constitutional courts comes with the inherent risk of leading to the logic of 'might is right'. On the other hand, even though one could identify cases where the judicial actors seem to miss an opportunity to improve the protection of individual rights or where they reveal a troubling eagerness to ensure their own authority, such risks are an idiosyncrasy of the system of constitutional pluralism. The theory of constitutional pluralism has the ambition of improving the quality of judgments and creating a framework for fruitful interaction of competing visions of Europe. Single judgments that may be open to criticism do not bring into question the viability of the whole framework, but it is nonetheless important to be aware of the systemic risks.",,,"Cebulak, P.; Institut d'Etudes Européennes, Belgium",,"Faculty Of Law, University Of Zagreb",18455662,,,,"English","Croat.

The hypothesis, which was set up by examining empirical evidence, points to heterogeneity across the macroeconomic conditions prevailing in different clusters of EMU countries. Given the strengthened financial and real interconnections across the EMU countries, the capital flows triggered by widening distances between surplus and deficit trade balances, and also between sound and deteriorating public budgets, represent an important factor magnifying systemic risk and contagion. The econometric estimates we conducted concern two sub-periods, the two decades from the launch of the EMS in 1979 to 1999, and the first twelve years (1999-2010) of the monetary union. The findings sound as a confirmation that the strengthened financial and real interconnections across the EMU countries, instead of facilitating convergence among the Core and the Peripheral economies, have magnified and mutually reinforced imbalances. The divide between surplus and deficit countries - the backward EMU countries running larger current account deficits, and the more advanced countries accumulating larger current account surpluses - have brought about increasing capital outflows from the Periphery to pay for excess imports from the Core. Conversely, increasing capital flows were invested by the banks of the Core countries in the Periphery's public bonds. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Current account imbalances; European monetary union; Systemic risk",,"Angelini, E.C.; DiSSE, Italy",,"Elsevier B.V.",01672681,,JEBOD,,"English","J.

If this is true, oil companies should strive to achieve an environmentally correct image, especially by adhering to sustainability indexes in the capital market. If not, oil companies' stock prices are still not affected by sustainability indexes. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact on the market value of a chosen group of oil companies that adhered to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI World). It evaluates the variations in three indicators: a) the systemic risk of the chosen companies (beta), b) the sensitivity of their stock prices in relation to variations in crude oil prices, and c) the conditional variance of their stock prices (volatility). Findings of our analysis indicate that the betas of only two of the firms declined due to participation in the DJSI, and there was no change in volatility or association with the oil price for any of the firms. Therefore, there is still no consolidated positive impact - or at least not a statistically proven one - between adoption of a proactive environmental posture by oil companies, reflected by adhesion to the DJSI, and their stock prices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Dow Jones sustainability index; Oil companies; Stock prices","Crude oil; Environmental management; Industry; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Capital markets; Conditional variance; Crude oil prices; Dow Jones; Market values; Oil companies; Oil Prices; Oil stocks; Stock price; Sustainability index; Investments; adhesion; capital market; crude oil; hypothesis testing; market development; oil industry; sustainable development","Schaeffer, R.; Energy Planning Program, Bloco C, Sala 211, Ilha do Fundão, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 21941-972, Brazil; email: roberto@ppe.ufrj.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865423366

The desired exposures to risky assets such as stocks, bonds and commodities during these periods of systemic risk should be zero. This paper tests the effectiveness of two market timing strategies that intend to provide early signals for portfolio protection during turbulent times: a filter rule strategy based on the portfolio drawdown (DD) and drawup (DU) thresholds; and an exponential moving average (EMA) strategy based on the crossover of the fast moving average (FMA) and the slow moving average (SMA) of the fund values. The pre-specified market timing strategies are tested on the total return index of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World (MSCI World) Index since the inception of the index in 1997 through 2008. Both the optimal filter rule strategy and the optimal EMA strategy achieve Sharpe ratios that are higher than the Sharpe ratio of the unprotected MSCI World Index. The comparison of the historical risk-return characteristics reveals that the timing of protection is more accurate for the EMA strategy. As is the case for all market timing strategies, the signals provided by the protection mechanism lag the actual economic events.

The failure of financial institutions in the USA, is a clear evidence that the greater macro impact is beyond just the failure of few financial institutions. It can bring down the entire economy and can have global devastating impact. By realizing the grave systemic risk of the failure, US government is forced to intervene and bail out many institutions for greater macroeconomic reasons. It raises the view that perhaps the current regulating policies and methods are lacking efficiency in predicting the possibility of failure beforehand and hence are not effective in preventing that to happen. This research applies several existing methods of institutional failure and test the signaling ability of each method in predicting the bankruptcy beforehand. The authors apply Moody's financial ratios, Standard and Poor's financial ratio, Vaziri's financial ratio, Altman's Z score and then applying logit model and discriminant analysis, the authors test each of these model's predictive ability for future use. The paper analyzes the reasons like changes in market, policy, economy, and political influence which have led to bankruptcy. Banks or financial institutions from Europe, the United States and Asia are considered as samples. Samples are taken from the same period to analyze the effect of different methods. The results from this analysis should help us find the most significant method that could be used to identify the risk, so that necessary action could be taken to prevent the effect or reject the project which could lead to bankruptcy in the future. This research would also offer policy recommendations for regulating agencies as to which factors should be analyzed deeply and how to implement a preventive measure ahead of any potential problems. © Mo Vaziri, Rafiqul Bhuyan, Ponkala Anand Vaseekhar Manuel, 2012.","Bank failure; Logit; Prediction; Z score",,"Vaziri, M.United States",,"LLC CPC Business Perspectives",18104967,,,,"English","Investm.

If undiagnosed or untreated, this pathology represents a systemic risk factor and offers unfavorable conditions for dental treatments, especially those requiring bone healing. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate, by analysis of bone mineral density (BMD), that the alveolar bone healing process is altered in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Material and Methods: Wistar rats and SHRs were submitted to extraction of the upper right incisor and were euthanized 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after surgery. Right maxillae were collected, radiographed and analyzed using Digora software. BMD was expressed as minimum (min), middle (med) and maximum (max) in the medium (MT) and apical (AT) thirds of the dental alveolus. Results: The results were compared across days and groups. Wistar showed difference in med and max BMD in the MT between 7 and 28 and also between 14 and 28 days. The AT exhibited significant difference in med and min BMD between 7 and 28 days, as well as difference in min BMD between 28 and 42 days. SHRs showed lower med BMD in the MT at 28 days when compared to 21 and 42 days. Differences were observed across groups in med and min BMD at day 28 in the MT and AT; and in max BMD at 14, 21 and 42 days in the MT. Conclusions: These results suggest that the alveolar bone healing process is delayed in SHRs comparing with Wistar rats.","Bone density; Hypertension; Spontaneously hypertensive rats; Tooth socket",,"Antoniali, C.; Departamento de Ciências Básicas, Rua: José Bonifácio 1193, 16015-050, Araçatuba, SP, Brazil",,"Faculdade de Odontologia de Bauru da Universidade de Sao Paulo",16787757,,,,"English","J.

BPs have shown a sure effectiveness in the treatment and in the palliative care of such pathologies; on the other hand, an avascular osteonecrosis of the jaws (B-ONJ = Bisphosphonate OsteoNecrosis of the Jaw) has recently been reported as an adverse effect not only of BP intravenous infusions, but also of their prolonged oral administration. B-ONJ normally follows a dental extraction or other surgical procedure in the oral cavity, but it also can develop spontaneously. In the latter case, some systemic risk factors, such as comorbidities and co-therapies or jaw anatomical conditions, can play a leading role in the onset of this pathologic condition. B-ONJ is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of BP therapy that can gravely affect the patient's quality of life, producing significant morbidity. To date, no therapies are completely effective and predictable in the treatment of B-ONJ, therefore prevention should be strongly promoted by sharing knowledge in the involved medical community.

In recent crisis episodes the architecture of global governance has been held responsible for weak or ineffective regulatory mechanisms that failed to either prevent systemic crises or to at least give an ""early warning"" of impending disasters, while in other episodes global governance institutions have been blamed for poor crisis responses and management. Global governance institutions have also been blamed for failing to expand the scope of their jurisdictions to incorporate new systemic risks and new market players, as well as for their inability to adapt to new political, economic, social and environmental challenges. The framing article for this special issue on ""Global Governance in Crisis"" examines four key features of global governance in the context of the global financial crisis: (1) the dynamic role played by ideas in making global governance ""hang together"" during periods of crisis; (2) how crisis serves as a driver of change in global governance (and why it sometimes does not); (3) how ubiquitous the global financial crisis was as an event in world politics; and (4) the conditions that constitute an event as a crisis. Due to the complexity and institutional ""stickiness"" of the contemporary architecture of global governance, the article concludes that a far-reaching overhaul and structural reforms in global governance processes is both costly and improbable in the short-term. © 2012 University of Kent.",,"financial crisis; governance approach; politics","André, B.",,,13600826,,,,"English","Global Soc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857084822

Materials and Methods: The study included type II diabetes mellitus subjects who were enrolled from a cross-sectional study. Participants underwent biochemical testing and comprehensive ocular examination including stereo fundus photography. The VI was defined based on the World Health Organization criteria. Results: The prevalence of VI was 4% in the cohort. The risk factors associated with the presence of VI included a female gender, age greater than 60 years, low socio-economic status, hypertension, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, neuropathy, use of insulin and alcohol. Various ocular risk factors are nuclear sclerosis, subjects who have undergone cataract surgery, myopia and sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR). After adjusting for the factors using stepwise logistic regression analysis, hypertension, use of alcohol, post-cataract surgery and myopia were not risk factors. Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that VI was higher among subjects older than 60 years (odds ratio (OR): 4.95 [2.67-9.15]) and those who belonged to a low socio-economic status (OR: 2.91 [1.24-6.85]). The systemic risk factors for VI included microalbuminuria (OR: 2.91 [1.59-5.33]), macroalbuminuria (OR: 4.65 [1.57-13.77]) and presence of neuropathy (OR: 1.97 [1.09-3.59]) among subjects. Subjects with nuclear sclerosis (OR: 36.82 [11.12-112.36]) and presence of STDR (OR: 4.17 [1.54-11.29]) were at a higher risk of VI. Cataract was the most common cause of VI in the cohort. Conclusion: Visual impairment, among type II diabetic subjects (4%), is a major public health problem that needs to be addressed. Cataract is the most common reversible cause of vision impairment in this population.","Diabetes Mellitus; Prevalence; Risk factors; Visual Impairment","albumin; alcohol; insulin; age; alcohol consumption; article; biochemistry; cataract; cataract extraction; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic retinopathy; disease association; eye photography; female; gender; human; hypertension; India; logistic regression analysis; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; male; microalbuminuria; myopia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; social status; visual impairment; visual system examination","Sharma, T.; Shri Bhagwan Mahavir Vitreoretinal Services, 18 College Road, Chennai - 600006, Tamil Nadu, India; email: drtaruns@gmail.com",,,09749233,,,,"English","Middle East Afr.

While Indian financial firms have been fairly resilient compared with their global counterparts, we show that Indian private sector firms faced greater losses compared with public sector firms during the crisis period of 2008-09. We use a stock market-based measure of systemic risk, marginal expected shortfall (MES), to determine the systemic risk contributed by each Indian financial firm for the period preceding the crisis (January-December 2007) and compare it to its realised returns during the crisis (January 2008-February 2009). Our results show that public sector firms outperformed private sector firms despite having greater systemic risk during the crisis. We conclude that investors rewarded Indian public sector firms with greater systemic risk while penalising private sector firms with similar risk. We attribute this finding to the explicit and implicit government backing of public sector banks. We find that riskier public sector banks with high ex ante systemic risk and low Tier 1 capital received greater capital support from the government. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"banking; capital; financial crisis; financial system; risk assessment; state owned enterprise; stock market; India","Acharya, V.V.; Department of Finance, , New York, United States",,,03785920,,,,"English","World Econ.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856018854

Box 4036, Atlanta, GA 30302-4036, United States","The recent financial crisis and its cascading effects on the global economy have drawn increased attention to the regulation of financial institutions including insurance companies. While many observers would argue that insurance companies were not significant contributors to the crisis, the role of insurance companies in the financial economy and their potential vulnerability to systemic risk have become matters of considerable interest to policy-makers and regulators. In this context, this paper examines the basic economic principles that should govern the regulation of insurance and employs these principles in assessing current regulatory practices and potential reforms. Specifically, it articulates the basic rationale for insurance regulation, which is the remediation of market failures where regulation can enhance social welfare. In insurance, the principal market failures that warrant regulatory intervention are severe asymmetric information problems and principal-agent conflicts that could lead some insurance companies to incur excessive financial risk and/or engage in abusive market practices that harm consumers. This provides an economic basis for the regulation of insurers financial condition and market conduct. At the same time, the regulatory measures that are employed to correct market failures should be efficient and effective. Judged against these principles, the systems for solvency and market conduct regulation in the United States warrant significant improvement. There appears to be little or no justification for regulating insurance rates in competitive markets and the states should move forward with full deregulation of insurance prices. The EU appears to be much farther ahead in terms of implementing best practices in the regulation of insurers financial condition under its Solvency II initiative. It is also much closer to the desirable goal of full price deregulation than the United States. © 2012 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.","Insurance regulation; Market failures; Solvency II",,"Klein, R.W.; Department of Risk Management and Insurance Research, P.O.

Additionally, the paper aims to investigate the comovement of hedge fund index returns. Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies broad hedge fund investment strategies using data from the Dow Jones Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Database. It examines the return comovement using the cross-sectional volatility, covariance, and correlation metrics proposed in Adrian (2007). In addition, the paper examines whether correlations and covariance are important determinants of future volatility via traditional time-series regressions. Findings – The paper finds that the majority of the broad hedge fund investment strategies incurred record level losses and gains during the 2007-2010 period. In addition, it finds that the crisis period was preceded by high correlations, attributed primarily to a rise in cross-sectional hedge fund covariances. However, during the crisis period, a decrease in average correlations, stemming from an increase in hedge fund volatility, is documented. The time-series regressions are supportive of a strong relationship between cross-sectional covariances and subsequent volatility, suggesting that systemic risk occurs in the hedge fund sector when returns move significantly in dollar terms.

When banks differ in credit opportunities, a Pigovian tax on short-term funding is efficient in containing risk and preserving credit quality, while quantity-based funding ratios are distortionary. Liquidity buffers are either fully ineffective or similar to a Pigovian tax with deadweight costs. Critically, they may be least binding when excess credit incentives are strongest. When banks differ instead mostly in gambling incentives (due to low charter value or overconfidence), excess credit and liquidity risk are best controlled with net funding ratios.

Despite this still-popular sentiment, the Basel Accords, a set of international standards for banking supervision and regulation, have been the subject of remarkably little public criticism. While academics and practitioners decry the enforcement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on accounting reform or attempts by Congress to regulate executive compensation, the Basel Accords have been quietly accepted. In one of the first studies critically to examine the Basel Accords, Engineering the Financial Crisis reveals the crucial role that bank capital requirements and other government regulations played in the recent financial crisis. Jeffrey Friedman and Wladimir Kraus argue that by encouraging banks to invest in highly rated mortgage-backed bonds, the Basel Accords created an overconcentration of risk in the banking industry. In addition, accounting regulations required banks to reduce lending if the temporary market value of these bonds declined, as they did in 2007 and 2008 during the panic over subprime mortgage defaults. The book begins by assessing leading theories about the crisis-deregulation, bank compensation practices, excessive leverage, ""too big to fail,"" and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-and, through careful evidentiary scrutiny, debunks much of the conventional wisdom about what went wrong. It then discusses the Basel Accords and how they contributed to systemic risk. Finally, it presents an analysis of social-science expertise and the fallibility of economists and regulators. Engagingly written, theoretically inventive, yet empirically grounded, Engineering the Financial Crisis is a timely examination of the unintended-and sometimes disastrous-effects of regulation on complex economies.

Since the expectations of market participants play an important role in determining prices and growth, monetary policy can also be defined to include the directives, policies, statements, and actions of the Fed that influence how the future is perceived. In addition, the Fed acts as a ""lender of last resort"" to the nation's financial system, meaning that it ensures its sustainability, solvency, and integrity. This role has become of great importance with the onset of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007. Traditionally, the Fed has had three means for achieving its goals: open market operations involving the purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury securities, the discount rate charged to banks who borrow from the Fed, and reserve requirements that governed the proportion of deposits that must be held either as vault cash or as a deposit at the Federal Reserve. Historically, open market operations have been the primary means for executing monetary policy. Recently, in response to the financial crisis, direct lending has become important once again and the Fed has created a number of new ways for injecting reserves, credit, and liquidity into the banking system, as well as making loans to firms that are not banks. As financial conditions normalize, the Fed is moving back to a more traditional reliance on open market operations. The Fed conducts open market operations by setting an interest rate target that it believes will allow it to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable growth. The interest rate targeted is the federal funds rate, the price at which banks buy and sell reserves on an overnight basis. This rate is linked to other short term rates and these, in turn, influence longer term interest rates. Interest rates affect interest-sensitive spending-business capital spending on plant and equipment, household spending on consumer durables, and residential investment. In the short run, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or slow aggregate spending. While monetary policy is charged with promoting maximum sustainable economic growth, it does so only indirectly in the long run by maintaining a stable price level since the direct effect of monetary policy is primarily on the rate of inflation. A low and stable rate of inflation through the business cycle promotes price transparency and, thereby, sounder economic decisions by households and businesses. The Fed has frequently changed the federal funds target to match changes in expected economic conditions. Between January 3, 2001, and June 25, 2003, the target rate was reduced to 1% from 61/2%. This policy was reversed on June 30, 2004, and in 17 equal increments ending on June 29, 2006, the target rate was raised to 51/4%. No additional changes were made until September 18, 2007, when, in a series of 10 moves, the target was reduced to a range of 0% to 1/4% on December 16, 2008, where it now remains. Since then, the Fed has added liquidity to the financial system beyond what is needed to meet its federal funds target through direct lending and, more recently, purchases of Treasury and government sponsored enterprise (GSE) securities. This practice is sometimes referred to as quantitative easing.

The roots of the crisis go back much further, and there are various views on the fundamental causes. It is generally accepted that credit standards in U.S. mortgage lending were relaxed in the early 2000s, and that rising rates of delinquency and foreclosures delivered a sharp shock to a range of U.S. financial institutions. Beyond that point of agreement, however, there are many questions that will be debated by policymakers and academics for decades. Why did the financial shock from the housing market downturn prove so difficult to contain? Why did the tools the Fed used successfully to limit damage to the financial system from previous shocks (the Asian crises of 1997-1998, the stock market crashes of 1987 and 2000-2001, the junk bond debacle in 1989, the savings and loan crisis, 9/11, and so on) fail to work this time? If we accept that the origins are in the United States, why were so many financial systems around the world swept up in the panic? To what extent were long-term developments in financial markets to blame for the instability? Derivatives markets, for example, were long described as a way to spread financial risk more efficiently, so that market participants could bear only those risks they understood. Did derivatives, and other risk management techniques, actually increase risk and instability under crisis conditions? Was there too much reliance on computer models of market performance? Did those models reflect only the post-WWII period, which may now come to be viewed not as a typical 60-year period, suitable for use as a baseline for financial forecasts, but rather as an unusually favorable period that may not recur? Did government actions inadvertently create the conditions for crisis? Did regulators fail to use their authority to prevent excessive risk-taking, or was their jurisdiction too limited and/or compartmentalized? The multiple roots of the crisis are mirrored in the policy response. Two bills in the 111th Congress-H.R. 4173, passed by the House on December 11, 2009, and Senator Dodd's Restoring American Financial Stability Act, as ordered reported by the Senate Banking Committee on March 22, 2010-address many of the purported causal factors across the entire financial system. The bills address systemic risk, too-big-to-fail, prudential supervision, hedge funds, derivatives, payments systems, credit rating agencies, securitization, and consumer financial protection. (For a summary of major provisions, see CRS Report R40975, Financial Regulatory Reform and the 111th Congress, coordinated by Baird Webel.)

Academics and policymakers are searching for changes in the financial system that can correct any perceived weaknesses in the structure of regulation, the content of regulations, and the coverage of financial instruments and activities. Since the onset of the crisis, numerous proposals have been advanced to reform or amend the current financial system to help restore economic growth. In the United States, the Obama Administration has proposed a plan to overhaul supervision of the U.S. financial services sector. The proposal would give new authority to the Federal Reserve, create a new Financial Services Oversight Council, create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and create a new National Bank Supervisor to replace the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. In contrast, Senator Collins introduced S. 664, the Financial System Stabilization and Reform Act of 2009, with a companion measure, H.R. 1754, that was introduced by Representative Castle in the House of Representatives. The measures would create a Financial Stability Council and grant the Federal Reserve the authority to examine the soundness and safety of the financial system posed by bank holding companies. Other measures include: S. 1682 (Senator Cantwell), the Derivatives Market Manipulation Prevention Act of 2009; S. 1803 (Senator Merkley), the Federal Reserve Accountability Act of 2009; S. 2756 (Senator Warner) the Financial Services Systemic Risk Oversight Council Act of 2009; H.R. 3795 (Representative Frank), the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Acts of 2009; H.R. 3968 (Representative Ellison), to amend the Bank Holding Company Act; and H.R. 3996 (Frank), to improve financial stability. The crisis has underscored the fact that national and international financial markets have become highly integrated, and problems in one market can trigger contagion that can spread both among countries and into economic sectors to affect businesses, employment, and household well being. Similarly, governments in Europe are considering what, if any, changes they should make to their national financial systems. Along with the United States and other countries, European countries also are considering changes to the international systems of financial supervision and regulation in order to ensure prosperity through the smooth operation of domestic and international financial systems. This process may include reconsidering the roles and responsibility of the central banks in the post-financial crisis era. Various organizations and groups are advancing a large number of recommendations and prescriptions. Some goals for any such adjustments may include providing an institutional structure for oversight and regulation that is robust, comprehensive, flexible, and politically feasible while providing appropriate incentive structures to preclude excessive risk- taking. Of course, there are no guarantees that amending the current system or employing a different regulatory and supervisory structure will preclude a repeat of the most recent financial crisis given that financial markets and institutions are continually growing, innovating, and responding to government- and market-imposed constraints. This report addresses the European perspectives on a number of proposals that are being advanced for financial oversight and regulation in Europe. The European experience may be instructive because financial markets in Europe are well developed, European firms often are competitors of U.S. firms, and European governments have faced severe problems of integration and consistency across the various financial structures that exist in Europe. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Jackson, J.K.",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781617280061,,,"English","Intern.

This chapter provides an overview of current U.S. financial regulation: which agencies are responsible for which institutions and markets, and what kinds of authority they have. There are two traditional components to U.S. banking regulation: deposit insurance and adequate capital. Commercial banks accept a quid pro quo that was adopted in response to widespread bank failures during the 1930s. Through deposit insurance, the federal government provides a safety net for some banking operations and in return the banks that are exposed to depositor runs accept federal regulation of their operations, including the amount of risk they may incur. Since the 1860s, federal banking regulation has sought to prevent excessive risk taking by banks that might seek to make extra profit by reducing their capital reserves-at the time called ""wildcat"" banks. There are five federal bank regulators, each supervising different (and often overlapping) sets of depository institutions. Federal securities regulation is based on the principle of disclosure, rather than direct regulation. Firms that sell securities to the public must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the agency has no authority to prevent excessive risk taking. SEC registration in no way implies that an investment is safe, only that the risks have been fully disclosed. The SEC also registers several classes of securities market participants and firms, but relies more on industry self-regulation than do the banking agencies. Derivatives trading is supervised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees trading on the futures exchanges, which have self-regulatory responsibilities as well. There is also a large over-the-counter (off-exchange) derivatives market that is largely unregulated. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) oversees a group of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)-public/private hybrid firms that seek both to earn profits and to further the policy objectives set out in their statutory charters. Two GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were placed in conservatorship by the FHFA in September 2008 after losses in mortgage asset portfolios made them effectively insolvent. A number of financial markets are unregulated, including some of the largest. No federal agency has jurisdiction over trading in foreign exchange or U.S. Treasury securities; nonbank lenders fall outside the regulatory umbrella; and hedge funds, private equity firms, and venture capital investors are largely unregulated (although their transactions in securities and derivatives markets may be). The United States has never attempted a wholesale reformation of the entire regulatory system comparable to the 1986 ""Big Bang"" in the UK, which reorganized regulatory agencies across industry lines and sought to implement a consistent philosophy of regulation. In the wake of the current financial turmoil, however, such a reevaluation is possible, and a number of broad restructuring proposals have already come forward. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 4173 presents comprehensive reform of the banking agencies, derivatives regulation, investor protection, systemic risk, and other concerns. In the Senate, a committee print by Senator Dodd containing comprehensive reform was issued on November 16, 2009. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Jickling, M.",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781617280061,,,"English","Intern.

The design of what replaces Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae' the housing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)'1 which are currently in conservatorship' is of enormous consequence to the performance of the U.S. housing market in the future. In our opinion' the goals of the efforts to reorganize Freddie and Fannie should be to promote the availability and stability of mortgage finance for the core of the housing market while minimizing systemic risk and costs to taxpayers. Any new structure should be designed to be resilient over the business cycle so that mortgage financing neither dries up during periods of market stress nor expands excessively during periods of market ebullience. The recent financial crisis demonstrated how the implicit government guarantee and unique market structure of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) can support the availability of mortgage credit during times of severe market stress. Figures 12.1 and 12.2 show the relative stability of the supply of mortgages that are eligible for securitization through Fannie and Freddie (""conforming mortgages"")' compared to jumbo mortgages' which are of credit quality similar to that of conforming loans but are not eligible for agency securitization because of their larger size. Before the onset of the financial crisis' the jumbo segment accounted for around one quarter of the value of mortgage originations (see Figure 12.2)' and the interest-rate spread between jumbo and conforming loans was small and declining (see Figure 12.1). However' as the crisis unfolded after August 2007' spreads between jumbo rates and conforming loan rates widened sharply from about 25 basis points to over 100 basis points' and the share of jumbo mortgage originations fell from 30 percent to only 10 percent. This sharp decline in jumbo mortgage supply reflected a collapse in non-agency MBS issuance after mid-2007 and the effect of increasing credit-risk premiums given the lack of a government credit guarantee on jumbo loans. In response to this trend and to provide additional support for the mortgage market' the conforming loan limit was increased in high-housing-cost areas in February 2008' from $417'000 to as much as $729'750.3 For loans that fell between the old and new conforming loan limits (high-balance conforming loans)' which now became eligible for agency securitization' interest rates quickly returned to levels that were very close to those for standard conforming loans' and the quantity of lending expanded significantly. However' the supply of mortgage finance above the new higher conforming loan limits remained low' reflecting the inability of originators to securitize or hedge the credit risk on those loans.

This scrutiny includes examining the impact that financial models, financial products (e.g., credit default swaps), and business operating styles (e.g., the amount of financial leverage) have on managing and hedging risk.1 The financial crisis has also raised issues on how the individual objectives of firms on Wall Street are harmonized to achieve broader societal goals (e.g., increased home ownership). The risk governance objective of a chief risk officer (CRO) in financial firms is to guide management toward controlling the amount of risk through ensuring measures of risk are reasonably accurate and assigning risk limits based on a clearly articulated set of corporate objectives. The risk governance objectives of the CRO are also designed to protect the firm from excessive losses in stressed markets. The objective of a corporate treasurer is to generate gap revenue 2 within interest rate risk governance limits assigned by the CRO. Financial firms rely on highly analytical financial models to guide the firm toward achieving clearly articulated risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) objectives (see the Appendix for an explanation of RAROC). A significant challenge for regulators is to tie the deployment of financial models within the firm to the amount of risk generated external to the firm. Typically the internal risk governance objective of financial firms is neither designed to enhance the health of Main Street nor harmonized to achieve societal goals in stressed markets. For example, the objective of a trader is to generate trading revenue within trading risk governance limits assigned by the CRO. Risk governance to control model risk within financial firms is typically not designed to reduce external systemic risk across the financial markets in stressed markets. Systemic risk refers to the risk of a systemwide financial crisis caused by the contemporaneous failure of a substantial number of financial markets, institutions, or both. Sophisticated financial theories are analytically elegant, but over and over again the shock of extremely volatile markets has demonstrated that the application of financial theories that either guide portfolios toward optimal solutions (e.g., making investment decisions based on using modern portfolio theory [MPT]) or link return with risk (such as based on using the capital asset pricing model [CAPM]) is a double-edged sword. Financial firms that understand the inherent risk of marketing and trading financially engineered products (e.g., interest rate caps) have implemented risk governance policies that enable them to understand the limitations of financial models. Sophisticated financial firms that deploy leading-edge risk governance practices are able to slice and dice their risk as well as append warning labels to dashboards that serve to highlight the amount of risk in stressed markets. On the other hand, if financial firms fail to implement best-practice risk governance through well-designed risk-management programs, then many of these firms will be in danger of experiencing dramatic losses due to model risk in the so-called highly improbable stressed markets. There has been a relentless increase in the complexity of financial models and the associated valuation theories since 1973, with the publication of the Black-Scholes and the Merton models.3 The fixed-income instrument market, and the derivatives markets more generally, provide the most striking examples. Throughout the 1970s, the market risk of bonds was assessed using a simple duration-based measure, with or without an adjustment for convexity.4 As securities increased in sophistication to include features such as embedded options, valuation came to be based on complex models. The models work well in normal markets but tend to break down in stressed markets. The pace of model development accelerated through the 1980s and 1990s to support the rapid growth of financial innovations such as caps, floors, swaptions, spread options, and other exotic derivatives. Product innovations (e.g., credit default swaps) were themselves made possible by developments in financial theory that allowed analysts to capture many new facets of financial risk. The models could have never been implemented in practice, or have come to be so well accepted, had the growth in computing power not accelerated dramatically. Financial innovation, model development, and computing power have engaged in a game of leapfrog. Financial innovation calls for more model complexity, which in turn requires greater computing power. The proliferation of highly complex financial instruments contributed to the recent financial crisis since the risks of many of these complex financial products at the transaction level were not very well understood (e.g., collateralized debt obligations [CDOs] of an asset-backed security [ABS]). Models are utilized to calculate the economic value added (EVA)5 of business strategies, as well as to examine the impact of these strategies on standard profitability measures of performance6 in normal markets. A critical success factor toward simultaneously achieving firm-specific business strategies such as evaluating loans to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns on capital (see the Appendix for a numerical example) and the broader societal objectives of Main Street (e.g., reduced home foreclosures) is to find financial models that are capable of being utilized for best-practice internal risk management as well as for reducing external systemic risk across the financial system. Financial models can be deployed to link the impact of superior corporate governance on managing risk at both the transaction level and at the value-of-the-firm (V) level. For example, let WACC represent the weighted average cost of capital, as well as let Rs represent the cost of stock (S) and Rd the cost of debt (D). Further, let Ws and Wd represent percentages of the firm that are financed respectively with stock and debt. The traditional measure for the value of the firm can be calculated through discounting FCF (free cash flows) where WACC = Ws Rs + Wd Rd. If we let V equal the sum of discounted cash flows over the projected (Figure presented) life of the firm, then a particular challenge is to increase V through superior governance while reducing the volatility of V.7 (Equation presented).

The financing of housing and of urban infrastructure and services is crucial to the functioning of cities. Housing finance and urban finance share several characteristics. First, both are instruments that can be used to increase the overall standard of living. The ultimate goal of housing finance lies in improving the overall housing standards of the society and possibly contributing to financial sector development, and that of urban finance lies in providing high-quality urban infrastructure and recurrent services to the residents and businesses. The demand for housing finance derives from the demand for housing, especially owner-occupied housing, and the demand for urban finance comes from that for urban services. These demands are influenced by changing demographics, income, and prices of housing and urban services, respectively. The second shared characteristic concerns their macroeconomic dimension. Price stability is a precondition for well-functioning longterm mortgage markets, and the stability of housing finance systems affects the stability of housing markets and thus the wider economy. Mismanagement of subnational finance may impair the soundness of public finance and hence macroeconomic stability. Third, in recent years technology has improved the efficiency of both housing finance and urban finance. The widespread use of credit-scoring techniques and automated underwriting systems facilitates the mortgage loan origination process, while GIS (geographic information system)-aided tax cadastre and mass appraisal help administration of property taxation. Finally, financial discipline is important in both housing finance and urban finance. The recent U.S. subprime mortgage crisis has demonstrated that the consequences of over-indebtedness of the household sector can posit a systemic risk for the entire financial system and the macroeconomy. Large fiscal deficits and the debts of state and local governments can become a drain on the whole economy. Beyond these similarities, it is also clear that the operations of housing finance and urban finance are closely interrelated. The combination of decent housing finance and inadequate urban finance may lead to housing development without adequate urban services. Improved housing finance makes homeownership feasible for more people, and the increase in owner-occupied houses leads to a larger property tax revenue base that can, in turn, be tapped to maintain and upgrade urban services. This chapter looks at the current state of housing finance and urban finance, keeping their close linkages in mind. 1 We begin with a common framework for housing finance and urban finance and apply the framework to address the following questions: What is the context in which housing/urban finance operates? What do we know about a well-functioning housing/urban finance system? How do actual practices compare with an optimal or ideal state, and how do they vary across countries and cities? What should be done, and what barriers need to be overcome, to improve the current situation?. Copyright © 2011 University of Pennsylvania Press.

The elements that combined to create the crisis were subprime mortgage securities, credit default swaps, highly leveraged hedge funds, and excessive short-term borrowing at investment banks.1 They flourished without government oversight, transparency, or limits because proponents contended that ""private ordering"" of financial markets, instead of government intervention, was ideal. The champions of private ordering contended government interference was inappropriate for sophisticated investors (SIs) who had the expertise and incentives to properly assess risk, and to select and monitor complex investment options. They believed that by acting in their own interests, SIs would keep the market safe and ensure the efficient allocation of capital to businesses and individuals who would make the most productive use of the money. Sophisticated investors include, for example, government, corporate, and union pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, endowments, brokerdealers, insurance firms, banks, and sovereign funds. They also include individuals who earn as little as $200,000 per year. While many experts warned about the dangerous consequences of deregulation, 2 Congress and regulators accepted the conventional perspective that sophisticated market participants would police and avoid irrational conduct.3 The concept of the SI exception is embedded in our securities laws. It is a mechanism that allows securities issuers to sometimes bypass legal requirements intended to protect ordinary people who purchase securities (""retail investors""). The securities laws were designed, initially, to protect retail investors from confusing, worthless, or high-risk investments.4 In other words, ""Congress was concerned that the average investor was being fleeced in the financial markets by inadequate disclosure, misrepresentation, and manipulative schemes.""5 Thus, once an investor is deemed ""sophisticated,"" many investment options can be offered and sold without many protections.6 The demarcation between the ordinary and the sophisticated, as noted below, depends wholly upon wealth and not upon any measure of experience or skill. The SI concept spread to other financial laws and rules. And when new risky instruments emerged, the reliance upon a market filled with SIs was sufficient to convince lawmakers and regulators to remove barriers and allow for the expansion of these unregulated or very lightly regulated offerings. The SI exception may have been a valid carve-out to the early legal requirements from the 1930s. However, a few major changes make it no longer viable. First, unlike earlier securities offerings, financial instruments have grown far more complex than the capacity of computers to handle, let alone human brains. Some computer scientists and economists argue that ""even when buyers know all of the relevant information,"" it is nearly impossible to price even the simplest collateralized debt obligations7 and that it would take many days for a powerful computer to establish a price.8 As a result, mere humans, including most expert analysts, got lost in the complexity, fell prey to decision-making biases, and overlooked the absence of critical data points.9 In the debt and derivative markets, many of these tradable instruments did not exist in the 1930s, nor did they exist even prior to the 1980s or 1990s. Indeed, even those who constructed these instruments admitted difficulty pricing them. For example, a Goldman Sachs employee who helped build and sell such a structure posed this rhetorical question: ""Well, what if we created a 'thing,' which has no purpose, which is absolutely conceptual and highly theoretical and which nobody knows how to price?""10 Second, the incentive to maximize short-term personal welfare meant ""sophistication"" in forecasting and preventing the demise of one's firm and the financial system as a whole was subordinated to short-term profit seeking by senior executives and other employees. Thus, those who expected ""self-interest"" to prevail forgot the agency problem - that personal self-interest is not the same as the firm's or shareholders' self-interest. Third, a huge shift in ownership has occurred since the SI exemptions were conceived. In the early twentieth century, ""managerial capitalism""11 emerged, characterized by diffuse shareholders and powerful managers - the separation of ownership from control.12 However, by the end of the century, we experienced an intermediation revolution.13 In the 1970s, individuals held about 80 percent of U.S. corporate equities;14 however, currently, giant intermediary institutions hold legal title to approximately 70 percent. 15 Also, the vast majority of outstanding corporate and government bonds are held by institutions.16 While institutions may hold legal title to these investments, they are not the real investors who put their money at risk. Instead, they are often investing the capital of real people whose money is funneled to them through various other intermediaries. For example, in 2009, one class of institutional investor, the mutual fund, held 24 percent of U.S. equities.17 Institutional investors who make investment decisions without the benefit of proper protections do so on behalf of underlying or ""ultimate"" investors. These are pension fund beneficiaries, mutual fund shareholders, and other ordinary people who on their own behalf would not be considered sophisticated and thus could not directly make such purchases. Therefore, when a sophisticated institutional investor makes poor choices, this harms the ultimate investors, the people whom the securities laws were designed to protect. Former president Bill Clinton recently recognized this problem. He explained that the justification for the failure to regulate complex instruments was that: ""these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them and they don't need any extra protection, and any extra transparency⋯ And the flaw in that argument was that first of all sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make [them] without transparency⋯ And secondly, the most important flaw⋯ was even if less than 1 percent of the total investment community is involved in [these investments] so much money was involved that if they went bad, they could affect 100 percent of the investments, and indeed 100 percent of the citizens in countries.""18 In other words, reliance upon the sophisticated investor ignores reality; the entities the law deems to meet the definition are largely neither sophisticated enough to match the complexity of the instruments or lack of data nor the actual investors who have placed their capital at risk. Looking back on the global financial crisis, it is clear that reliance upon SIs was misguided. There are numerous examples of how SIs were not able to make good choices. And, these incidents were not on the fringes but central to the crisis. As more information emerges concerning the creation and sale of toxic securities, it is clear that reliance upon SIs provided the rationalization for sharp if not illegal practices. Firms like Goldman Sachs invoked the SI concept while defending against securities fraud allegations that it created and sold some sophisticated clients bonds that were designed to fail while allowing others who helped create the bonds to bet against them. In addition, lobbyists and legislators continue to rely upon the sophisticated investor framework to shield certain financial institutions and instruments from government oversight. In this fashion, the SI concept continues to be trumpeted by those who seek carve-outs from reform efforts. Despite the reliance on the SI concept, little attention has been paid to the importance of the SI failure. Accordingly, an examination of the incapacity of sophisticated investors to monitor unregulated investment options and of the role sophisticated investors play in creating systemic risk is a necessary prerequisite to restoring financial safety and economic stability.

Academics and policymakers are searching for changes in the financial system that can correct any perceived weaknesses in the structure of regulation, the content of regulations, and the coverage of financial instruments and activities. Since the onset of the crisis, numerous proposals have been advanced to reform or amend the current financial system to help restore economic growth. In the United States, the Obama Administration has proposed a plan to overhaul supervision of the U.S. financial services sector. The proposal would give new authority to the Federal Reserve, create a new Financial Services Oversight Council, create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and create a new National Bank Supervisor to replace the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. In contrast, Senator Collins introduced S. 664, the Financial System Stabilization and Reform Act of 2009, with a companion measure, H.R. 1754, that was introduced by Representative Castle in the House of Representatives. The measures would create a Financial Stability Council and grant the Federal Reserve the authority to examine the soundness and safety of the financial system posed by bank holding companies. Other measures include: S. 1682 (Senator Cantwell), the Derivatives Market Manipulation Prevention Act of 2009; S. 1803 (Senator Merkley), the Federal Reserve Accountability Act of 2009; S. 2756 (Senator Warner) the Financial Services Systemic Risk Oversight Council Act of 2009; H.R. 3795 (Representative Frank), the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Acts of 2009; H.R. 3968 (Representative Ellison), to amend the Bank Holding Company Act; and H.R. 3996 (Frank), to improve financial stability. The crisis has underscored the fact that national and international financial markets have become highly integrated, and problems in one market can trigger contagion that can spread both among countries and into economic sectors to affect businesses, employment, and household well being. Similarly, governments in Europe are considering what, if any, changes they should make to their national financial systems. Along with the United States and other countries, European countries also are considering changes to the international systems of financial supervision and regulation in order to ensure prosperity through the smooth operation of domestic and international financial systems. This process may include reconsidering the roles and responsibility of the central banks in the post-financial crisis era. Various organizations and groups are advancing a large number of recommendations and prescriptions. Some goals for any such adjustments may include providing an institutional structure for oversight and regulation that is robust, comprehensive, flexible, and politically feasible while providing appropriate incentive structures to preclude excessive risk-taking. Of course, there are no guarantees that amending the current system or employing a different regulatory and supervisory structure will preclude a repeat of the most recent financial crisis given that financial markets and institutions are continually growing, innovating, and responding to government-and market-imposed constraints. This report addresses the European perspectives on a number of proposals that are being advanced for financial oversight and regulation in Europe. The European experience may be instructive because financial markets in Europe are well developed, European firms often are competitors of U.S. firms, and European governments have faced severe problems of integration and consistency across the various financial structures that exist in Europe. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

While the SEC's guidance does not constitute a legal change, it underlines more powerfully than ever that climate change is a risk that investors cannot ignore. Institutional investors, with their broad exposure to systemic risk, should be particularly alert to the implications of this new development. Pension funds control, on average, assets equivalent to 76 percent of the GDP of their respective countries throughout the Western world.1 In 2006, U.S. pension funds held shares representing approximately one-quarter of U.S. equity markets;2 U.K. pension funds held shares representing approximately 13 percent of U.K. equity markets.3 As large shareholders, they have profound potential to influence companies in almost all industries. This chapter focuses on Anglo-American pension funds, because they are similar enough to make comparison straightforward.4 The advent of two global crises, the global financial crisis and climate change, demands an examination of the investment decisions of pension funds in the face of increasingly complex risk. Are these financial behemoths fulfilling their potential to invest in a better future? Or are they acting myopically, concentrating on quarterly financial performance while funding business in ways that have contributed to and continue to fuel these crises? At the time of writing, climate change and the global financial crisis present significant challenges to governments around the world.5 These crises are, to an extent, linked by their genesis in short-termism: in both cases, governments and industry have fostered short-term financial gain without sufficient regard to longer-term social costs of the externalities at play.6 The Stern Review highlights the central importance of environmental sustain-ability to continued economic growth: The evidence shows that ignoring climate change will eventually damage economic growth. Our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century. And it will be difficult or impossible to reverse these changes. Tackling climate change is the pro-growth strategy for the longer term, and it can be done in a way that does not cap the aspirations for growth of rich or poor countries. The earlier effective action is taken, the less costly it will be.7 As for the financial crisis, pension funds have been hit hard. The total assets of all pension funds in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) declined by US$ 3.3 trillion (that is, nearly 20 percent) from December 2007 to October 2008.8 If private pension assets are included that figure rises to US$ 5 trillion.9 From a broad ethical point of view, it is arguable that pension funds should have a wider ambit of responsibility for promoting a sustainable future, given their financial power and their incursion into service provision once the purview of the state.10 I argue here that fiduciaries' personal ethical considerations should form a basis for individual investment decisions: the ethical viewpoints of individual trustees and asset managers are too subjective and idiosyncratic to form a proper basis for ad hoc investment decision making. On a wider scale, however, ethics can contribute to our ontological understanding of the role of pension funds. Benjamin Richardson argues that, given their financial significance, institutional investors have an obligation to use their power sustainably by investing in firms whose activities are sustainable.11 As Stern and others have argued, without environmental sustainability, the financial system ultimately cannot survive.12 The primary mandate of pension funds is the creation of financial returns for beneficiaries, but the extent to which this goal is achieved sustainably is a matter for trustees to decide. Pension funds have thus far shown some interest in advocating a change from the short-term focus of the financial system that has fueled the global financial crisis.13 However, the recent indication of interest is a far cry from action. The financial crisis has revealed that many pension funds are struggling to fulfill their primary mandate of successful financial management on behalf of beneficiaries, let alone to introduce the new variable of sustainability into their management approach.14 However, by moving toward a longer-term investment paradigm and considering climate change when designing their investment strategies, pension funds have the potential to fulfil their mandate to beneficiaries in a more sustainable manner. Reflecting on the context of climate change and the global financial crisis, this chapter sets out to demonstrate the theoretical potential of pension funds to drive the reduction of firms' climate change impact, and to expose the practical barriers that stand in their way. It examines first why fiduciary duty is perceived as a barrier to change in investment practices, outlining recent legal developments in the area. It argues that requirements of fiduciary duty have been interpreted too narrowly, and in theory should not be perceived as a legal barrier to pension funds' consideration of climate change: fiduciary duty has been flexible enough to evolve with social expectations in the past (and should be able to adapt to the increasing importance of climate change now). However, in practice, courts, commentators and trustees themselves have had the tendency to interpret fiduciary duty's requirement of prudence as what the majority of investors do. The prudent course of action in this light becomes to maintain the status quo, limiting the potential for innovation in investment strategy toward the inclusion of environmental considerations such as climate change. The uncertainty surrounding the content of fiduciary duty places a practical barrier to investment innovation in this area. Legislative clarification is needed if pension funds are to change their approach toward climate change. Moreover, the focus on fiduciary duty as a barrier to investment innovation in this area masks the behavioral biases toward inertia and short-termism in trustees, which are more insidious and at least as important. These biases, combined with the uncertainty surrounding fiduciary duty, result in a collective action problem: pension funds are unlikely to break with convention unless a significant number of them change their approach simultaneously. Under these conditions, any institutional acceptance of innovation toward a longer-term, more sustainable investment strategy that accounts for climate change will take strong leadership from pension funds themselves. It is worth noting from the outset that the arguments made here require us to put aside the dichotomy often created between the ""financial"" and the ""social."" In examining the overwhelming influence of the status quo on judicial interpretation of ""prudence,"" this chapter attempts to avoid this dichotomy. Instead, the focus here is on the ability of investors and the judiciary to adapt to new social realities; in this case the new social reality is that of environmental issues having a financial impact. At the heart of the argument presented here, therefore, social development requires a revision of what is seen as financial - in other words, the social and the financial are intertwined - and they must be. This chapter touches upon a range of important issues whose detailed examination is beyond its scope. In particular, it is not the work of this chapter to undertake an empirical analysis of the financial impact of consideration of climate change. This is occurring elsewhere, and comes in addition to the many studies on the financial performance of socially responsible investment (SRI) funds conducted in the past.15 Furthermore, it does not look in detail at the role of asset managers in managing pension fund investments; instead it explores the work of trustees in the earlier stage of creating investment strategies and in monitoring delegated functions. Finally, this chapter does not look in detail at the ethical arguments for and against pension funds' consideration of climate change. 16 Instead, the focus here remains upon, first, the extent to which, in theory, fiduciary duty presents a barrier to the potential for pension funds to contribute to a more sustainable financial system and in particular to have regard to climate change as a financial risk or opportunity, and, second, on the behavioral barriers that exist in practice.

This makes them unsuitable for exploring the implications of regulatory proposals such as Basel III which require agents to balance their exposure to risk by maintaining a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. In this paper, we will introduce an agent-based model of a financial market in which agents can invest in both risky and riskless assets. We will first validate our model against the empirically-observed stylized facts of financial time-series data and then we proceed to investigate the counterfactual implications of the Basel III proposals for systemic risk. We will also use our model to make testable predictions about the consequences of Basel III which we shall revisit if and when the regulation is implemented.

To support space debris risk assessments, probabilistic models have been developed to estimate incident fluxes of smaller debris particles (typically less than 10 cm) which currently cannot be tracked by space surveillance networks. Using a debris flux model and an appropriate ballistic limit equation (BLE), the risk of penetration of the spacecraft wall from debris impacts can be calculated, as is currently done to satisfy safety requirements for manned space missions. However, for unmanned missions, penetration of the spacecraft wall is not necessarily critical and may be an overly conservative indicator of mission risk. For an optimized satellite design, the influence of debris impacts on the functionality of components and the overall system needs to be evaluated. This paper proposes a computational methodology to predict the satellite system-level effects resulting from impacts of untrackable space debris particles. This approach seeks to improve on current risk assessment practices by assessing the physical damage to internal components from debris impacts and correlating these effects to system functional impairment. The proposed method combines a debris flux model with the Schäfer-Ryan-Lambert BLE, which accounts for the inherent shielding of components behind the spacecraft structure wall. Debris impact trajectories and component shadowing effects are considered. The failure probabilities of individual satellite components as a function of mission time are calculated. These results are correlated to expected functional impairment using a Boolean logic model of the system functional architecture to account for functional dependencies and redundancies within the system.

The term refers to the widespread practice in rural India of jury-rigging and customizing vehicles using only available resources and know-how. While the practice is often accompanied by indigence and corruption in traditional interpretations, the notion of jugaad has excited many commentators on India's emergence into the global economy in its promise of an inimitable Indian work ethic that defies traditional associations of otherworldliness and indolence - widely reported as inherent in India's society and culture. Jugaad has been identified across India's economy in the inventiveness of call-centre workers, the creativity of global transnational elites, and in the innovativeness of Indian product designs. The term has seen an unprecedented growth in popularity and is now proffered as a tool for development and a robust solution to global recession. Jugaad is now part of a wider method for working within resource constraints as 'Indovation'. In this context, the trope is presented as an asset that India can nurture and export. This article argues that far from being an example of 'disruptive innovation', jugaad in practice is in fact part and parcel of India's systemic risk and should not be separated from this framing. Viewed from this optic, jugaad impacts on society in negative and undesirable ways. Jugaad is a product of widespread poverty and underpins path dependencies stemming from dilapidated infrastructure, unsafe transport practices, and resource constraints. These factors make it wholly unsuitable both as a development tool and as a business asset.

First' the rapid rise in housing prices that characterized the period from 2004 to 2006 reduced housing affordability as traditionally measured. Second' an expansion of high-risk mortgage lending helped to fuel' or at a minimum helped to sustain' the rise in house prices' facilitated the drawing out by households of accumulated home equity' and left homeowners at greater risk of default. The subsequent meltdown generated the ongoing wave of foreclosures that has further eroded homeownership. Third' although affordability has recovered' the episode has reduced household creditworthiness and prompted a procyclical response-increased capital assessments and tightened credit standards in mortgage credit markets-making entrance or return to homeownership more difficult for many families. This chapter presents preliminary evidence on the impact of the housing bubble' the flood of high-risk mortgage lending' and the subsequent meltdown on homeownership. We then review the developing literature on the factors behind the expansion of the high-risk lending that played such an important role in the bubble and meltdown. We end by discussing how policymakers' by being conscious of these factors' may be able to mitigate potential recurrence of this episode and more successfully promote sustainable homeownership. In our discussion of the factors driving the expansion of high-risk lending' we emphasize agency or information problems in the mortgage origination and securitization market' incomplete risk transfer' and underassessment of systemic risk. We argue that policymakers must take into account these factors and their relationship to exaggerated house price dynamics or housing bubbles' which are clearly harmful to the objective of sustainable homeownership. We highlight several matters that require increased attention from policymakers' including consumer protection and education' potentially misaligned incentives of mortgage originators and other market participants' capital requirements for mortgages' and improved financial and regulatory data.

The extent of NP was assessed using the preoperative radiological staging according to Lund-Mackay; the median CT score was 16 points, Q 0.25, Q 0.75 (13.18). In 42 patients (45%) the value of radiological CT staging was higher than 16 points, which corresponds to the category of the diffuse NP. The surgery was performed in accordance with the principles of the functional endonasal surgery concept and the extent of the surgery was classified according to a surgical score. The average follow-up period was 73 (45-125) months. Determination of recurrence rate was an important criterion to evaluate the success of treatment. In the follow-up period, 24 (25.5%) recurrences were diagnosed. The median value of the recurrence-free interval was 39. months. For evaluation of the prognostic significance of systemic risk factors, the patients were divided into 4 subgroups.

In cancer prevention, metformin may act (1) indirectly through reducing systemic risk factors; or (2) directly through AMPK-mediated signaling. To begin to delineate clinically relevant mechanisms for breast cancer prevention, metformin was also studied along with dietary energy restriction. Materials and Methods: Mammary cancer was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats (50 mg/kg MNU, i.p.). Metformin was fed alone (AIN93G + 0.05 to 1.0% w/w metformin) or combined with 40% dietary energy restriction. Plasma analytes (e.g., insulin, glucose, IGF-1) and protein expression (e.g., AMPK, mTOR, Akt) in mammary carcinomas and liver were evaluated. Additional studies included (1) aldehyde dehydrogenase flow cytometry, to gauge potential for cancer-initiated cells in mammary carcinomas to respond to metformin; (2) cell culture, to understand dose response (0.02-20 mM) of different cancer cell line molecular subtypes to metformin; and (3) analysis of a rat mammary epithelial cell microarray database, to examine expression of genes related to metformin pharmacokinetics (e.g., organic cation transporters) and pharmacodynamics (e.g., complex I of electron transport). Results: While a dosing regimen of 1.0%/0.25% metformin-reduced palpable mammary carcinoma incidence, multiplicity, and tumor burden and prolonged latency, lower doses of metformin failed to inhibit carcinogenesis despite effects on plasma insulin. Human breast cancer cell growth inhibition in response to metformin was only observed at high concentrations. Poor in vivo and in vitro response to metformin may be the result of pharmacokinetic (OCT-1 expression was low in rat mammary cells; OCT-3 was downregulated in mammary carcinoma) and pharmacodynamic (complex I transcripts were higher in mammary epithelial cells from carcinomas versus uninvolved gland) effects. In combination with dietary energy restriction, metformin offered protection against new tumor occurrence following release from combined treatment. Flow cytometry indicated the presence of cancer-initiated cells in mammary carcinomas. Conclusions: As a single agent, metformin possessed limited cancer inhibitory activity. However, metformin may be an effective component of multiagent interventions that target cancer-initiated cells. There is a clear need to identify the conditions under which metformin is likely to benefit prevention and control of breast cancer.","AMP-activated protein kinase; insulin; mammalian target of rapamycin; mammary carcinogenesis; metformin","adenylate kinase; aldehyde dehydrogenase; glucose; insulin; mammalian target of rapamycin; metformin; octamer transcription factor 1; octamer transcription factor 4; protein kinase B; somatomedin C; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; breast cancer; breast epithelium; caloric restriction; cancer cell culture; cancer prevention; chemically induced disorder; controlled study; data base; epithelium cell; female; flow cytometry; glucose blood level; growth inhibition; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin blood level; liver; microarray analysis; nonhuman; pharmacodynamics; protein expression; rat; tumor volume","Zhu, Z.; Cancer Prevention Laboratory, , Fort Collins, CO 80523, United States",,,09746773,,JCOAB,,"English","J.

Policymakers should therefore make every effort to avoid a systemic financial crisis and maintain financial stability by pursuing sound macroeconomic and regulatory policies, identifying systemic risks when they emerge, and acting on them to reduce the likelihood of a crisis. The crisis devastated the economies of the United States and Europe, and severely affected the Asian economies through the trade channel. Global economic recovery is under way at this writing in late 2010. However, the continuation of the recovery is not certain, and there is a risk of a ""double dip"" due to the sovereign debt crises in Greece, Ireland, and a few other southern European countries in the euro zone, as well as high unemployment, subdued household consumption, and a sluggish commercial real estate sector in the United States. The bright side of the global economy is that a solid recovery is taking hold in emerging Asia, particularly in the People's Republic of China (PRC, henceforth), India, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Most Asian financial systems have not been significantly affected by the global financial crisis for three reasons. First, Asian authorities undertook significant supervisory and regulatory reforms in the wake of the 1997-98 financial crisis to improve their banks' balance sheet quality as exemplified by low nonperforming loans, high capital ratios, and low leverage-and risk management practices. Second, Asian economies have reduced short-term external debt while accumulating sizable foreign exchange reserves, which has helped enhance their capacity to respond to external shocks. Third, Asian financial firms have taken a conservative approach to risk taking and business-such as eschewing the use of sophisticated derivatives, expanded securitization businesses, and the origination and sale of complex structured instruments to investors. This is partly due to the authorities' prudent-but often tight-regulation and supervision. Nevertheless, Asian monetary and financial authorities need to respond to new challenges posed by the global financial crisis and the recent regulatory reforms pursued in the G-20 process. With the further liberalization of financial market activities and opening up of financial markets to foreign firms, emerging Asia's financial services and business activities are expected to become more sophisticated and complex, which will pose additional challenges. Authorities need to continuously upgrade their technical and analytical capacity to effectively regulate and supervise financial firms and markets so as to promote both financial innovation and stability. In the rest of this chapter I summarize the progress on financial system reforms achieved as a result of the G-20 process and argue that emerging Asia benefits from such progress but should properly balance the need to develop financial markets and promote financial stability. I then discuss the challenges of further developing and deepening emerging Asia's financial sectors and upgrading financial regulation and supervision. Finally, I address the issue of managing capital inflows and maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability under volatile global financial conditions. Copyright © 2011.

Better alternatives to tax the financial sector are likely to be available. However, a tax on financial transactions could be justified in order to limit socially undesirable transactions when more direct means of doing so are unavailable for political or practical reasons. Some financial transactions are indeed likely to do more harm than good, especially when they contribute to the systemic risk of the financial system. However, such a financial transaction tax should be very small, much smaller than the negative externalities in question, because it is a blunt instrument that also drives out socially useful transactions. There is a case for taxing over-the-counter derivative transactions at a somewhat higher rate than exchange-based derivative transactions. More targeted remedies to drive out socially undesirable transactions should be sought in parallel, which would allow, after their implementation, to reduce or even phase out financial transaction taxes.","D62; F30; financial regulation; financial transactions; G10; global financial crisis; H20; Tobin tax; transaction tax",,"Darvas, Z.; Bruegel, Brussels, Belgium",,,15889726,,,,"English","Soc.

Design: Retrospective chart review. Participants: 139 patients. Methods: Retrospective collection of demographic, medical, surgical and postoperative data of all patients undergoing vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease at The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. Main Outcome Measure: Correlation of the rates of persistent vitreous cavity haemorrhage and anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment. Results: Sixty-eight of 155 (43.9%) eyes of 139 patients were on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy prior to surgery. At the time of surgery, 29 (42.6%) were on therapy. Eight of 29 (27.6%) patients had significant persistent vitreous cavity haemorrhage in the postoperative period, with four (13.8%) requiring secondary surgery. Thirty-nine (57.4%) patients had discontinued therapy prior to surgery. Among these, four (10.3%) had persistent bleeding, of which three (7.7%) required additional surgery. Six of 87 (6.9%) patients not on any anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy had persistent postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage, with none requiring further surgery. Patients on anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy at the time of surgery were more likely to experience persistent haemorrhage and subsequent reoperation (OR=4.8, P=0.0045 and OR=6.6, P=0.024, respectively). Conclusion: Perioperative continuation of anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment appears to increase the risk of persistent postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage and the necessity for vitreous cavity washout in this diabetic cohort. Appropriate preoperative cessation of treatment appeared to reduce this risk; however, caution must be taken with regard to the systemic risk associated with cessation of therapy. © 2011 The Authors.

In particular, we generate the distribution of banks' losses following the Basel 2 theoretical approach and focus on the part of this distribution that is not covered by capital (tail risk). We also refine our approach by considering two major sources of systemic risks: the correlation between banks' assets and interbank lending contagion. The application of our model to 2007 data for a sample of Italian banks shows that the target size of the Italian deposit insurance system covers up to 98. 96% of its potential losses. Furthermore, it emerges that the introduction of bank contagion via the interbank lending market could lead to the collapse of the entire Italian banking system. Our analysis points out that the existing Italian deposit insurance system can be assessed as adequate only in normal times and not in bad market conditions with substantial contagion between banks. Overall, we argue that policy makers should explicitly consider the following when estimating DIS loss distributions: first, the regulatory framework within which banks operate such as (Basel 2) capital requirements; and, second, potential sources of systemic risk such as the correlation between banks' assets and the risk of interbank contagion. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Basel 2; Contagion risk; Deposit insurance; Financial safety net; Systemic risk",,"de Lisa, R.; University of Cagliari, Viale S.

Although historically, the financial system has been able to deal with major shocks, the fact remains that our financial system is not as secure as it should be. Recent years have brought about too many examples of contagion and systemic risk. That is why Financial Contagion is such an important read. In it, the serious concerns that revolve around our fragile economic system are investigated, researched, and explained. Throughout the book, Kolb offers valuable insights on this dilemma as he compiles the history of financial contagion, highlights the latest research on systemic failure and interrelated markets, and analyzes the risks and consequences we face moving forward. Examines the importance of careful regulation and what must be done to stabilize the global financial system. Includes contributed chapters from both academics and experienced professionals, offering a variety of perspectives and a rich interplay of ideas. Details how close we are to witnessing a financial contagion that could devastate the world economy. We have been harshly reminded of how fragile our economic ecosystem is.

During these periods farmers' crops are at risk and for a largely poor population few can afford the turmoil to livelihoods that goes along with drought. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the willingness of Shaanxi and Gansu farmers to purchase weather insurance. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on surveyed results of 890 farm households in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. The survey was designed specifically to extract willingness to pay for weather insurance. Factor affecting willingness to pay are explained using linear regression. Findings – The authors find strong evidence that the demand for drought insurance is downward sloping and also believe from the analysis that the demand is fairly elastic. This suggests that price matters and the results suggest that in order for wide spread adoption of weather insurance farmers will require a substantial premium, perhaps in the order of 80 per cent, as is being applied to current crop insurance initiatives. The authors find, as expected, that crop producers would be willing to pay more for insurance than livestock producers, but also find, as one would expect, that the key indicator is risk. Using a Pert distribution, the authors constructed from information gathered from farmers the expected values and standard deviations of gross revenues and yields of the most prominent crop and constructed the coefficient of variation. It was found in both cases that the higher the CV the greater the willingness to pay. Originality/value – The authors believe that this is the first willingnesstopay study of weather insurance uptake in China. The authors used a unique “experimental” design and investigation technique to determine weather insurance demand. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Agriculture; China; Insurance; Risk analysis; Weather insurance; Willingness to pay",,,,,1756137X,,,,"English","China Agric.

Despite their different origins, banking crises display similar patterns. Their causes lie in unsustainable macroeconomic policies, market failures, regulatory distortions, and government interference in the allocation of capital; they are frequently characterized by boom-bust cycles in credit and asset prices; and they are generally resolved through large-scale government intervention. When not handled effectively and swiftly, banking crises tend to impose enormous costs to society by curtailing the flow of credit to the real economy. The article concludes with a review of proposals to enhance financial stability in an increasingly integrated financial system, which include making banking regulation more macroprudential-focusing on the cycle and systemic risk rather than the risk of individual banks-and improving market discipline by limiting explicit and implicit government insurance of bank liabilities. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

A crucial element of this task is the treatment of systemic risk. Basel III gains centre stage in this process. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate Basel III, examining its ability to reduce systemic risk. Design/methodology/approach – The paper highlights the importance of reducing systemic risk to achieve the goal of overall financial stability. By first focusing on the theoretical foundations of systemic risk, this paper explores and analyzes the crucial aspects of this almost impalpable risk type. It further investigates the current regulation of systemic risk, clearly showing Basel II's inability to reduce it. Then, it evaluates the Basel Committee's efforts to address these weaknesses through Basel III by investigating its incentives and its ability to reduce obvious drawbacks of Basel II as well as systemic risk factors. Findings – The findings show that there are still adjustments necessary. Although the development of Basel III is well advanced, providing some stabilizing incentives, there are still issues calling for closer consideration to counter all Basel II drawbacks and systemic risk factors adequately. These include: a risk-weighted leverage ratio; a more thorough treatment of procyclicality; adjustments for the NSFR (Net Stable Funding ratio); and most importantly, the mandatory issue to internalize negative externalities from financial institutions, that is, the call for pricing systemic risk. Originality/value – The paper not only examines the new Basel III framework, as a response to the Financial Crisis 2007-2009, but also draws attention to specific areas which the Basel Committee and regulators need to focus on more thoroughly. © 2011, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Basel III; Financial regulation; Financial stability; International finance; Macroprudential regulation; Risk management; Systemic risk",,"Schwerter, S.; Ernst & YoungGermany; email: StefanSchwerter@gmx.de",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13581988,,,,"English","J.

The IMF for example in its yearly 2009 Global Financial Stability Report acknowledged the lack of proper tools and research on the topic. Understanding how disruptions can propagate across financial markets is therefore of utmost importance. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we use empirical data to show that the world's markets have a non-linear threshold response to events, consistent with the hypothesis that traders exhibit change blindness. Change blindness is the tendency of humans to ignore small changes and to react disproportionately to large events. As we show, this may be responsible for generating cascading events-pricequakes-in the world's markets. We propose a network model of the world's stock exchanges that predicts how an individual stock exchange should be priced in terms of the performance of the global market of exchanges, but with change blindness included in the pricing. The model has a direct correspondence to models of earth tectonic plate movements developed in physics to describe the slip-stick movement of blocks linked via spring forces. Conclusions/Significance: We have shown how the price dynamics of the world's stock exchanges follows a dynamics of build-up and release of stress, similar to earthquakes. The nonlinear response allows us to classify price movements of a given stock index as either being generated internally, due to specific economic news for the country in question, or externally, by the ensemble of the world's stock exchanges reacting together like a complex system. The model may provide new insight into the origins and thereby also prevent systemic risks in the global financial network. © 2011 Andersen et al.",,"article; dynamics; earthquake; financial management; hypothesis; information processing; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; probability; social marketing; social network; socioeconomics; international cooperation; investment; Internationality; Investments","Andersen, J.

We compare the optimal portfolio choices and investment results of these strategies in an historical simulation, using almost three decades of historical stock price data. Our main findings are as follows: the crisis-conscious investor tends to choose less extreme portfolio weights for individual stocks than the ignorant investor.

The model addresses both the lending sentiment of a lender in isolation as well as the impact on that lending sentiment of the behavior of other lenders. The risk associated with lending is incorporated through a stochastic treatment of loan dynamics that treats prepayment and default as competing risks. With this model we are able to generate endogenously the rapid changes in lending opinion that attend slow changes in lending profitability and find these dynamics to be consistent with the rise and collapse of the non-Agency mortgage-backed securities market in 2007/2008. As the parameters of this model correspond to well-known phenomena in cognitive and social psychology, we can both explain why economic instability has proved robust to advances in risk measurement and suggest how policy for reducing economic instability might be formulated in an experimentally sound manner. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using derivatives-related failures during the 1990s, the authors draw conclusions that are pertinent to the recent financial market turmoil involving OTC derivatives. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use the event-study methodology with crude dependence adjustment to examine the wealth effect for the involved derivatives dealers. The authors re-estimate the parameters using the market-adjusted model to check for robustness. In addition, a multivariable regression framework was used to estimate the determinants of the abnormal returns. Findings – OTC derivatives dealers experience negative returns when their clients announce derivatives losses. In contrast, rival dealers uninvolved in the loss event exhibit positive returns. The extent of the positive returns for the rival dealers grows as new events unfold, and the dealers continue to steer clear of derivatives trouble. A broader industry portfolio of securities brokers, dealers, and advisors is affected negatively, indicating possible industry contagion. The cross-sectional analysis of the abnormal returns indicates the presence of information (and not pure) contagion implying that in a financial crisis involving derivatives systemic failure is not likely. Originality/value – The authors extend the literature by examining an exhaustive set of derivatives loss events. The sample includes a more diverse set of derivatives dealers and it spans a longer time period than prior studies did. This is also the first study confirming the distorting impact of the “too big to fail” and “federal safety net” phenomena in the context of OTC derivatives dealing. © 2011, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dealers; Derivative markets; Loss; OTC derivatives; Securities; Systemic risk; United States of America",,"Emm, E.E.; Albers School of Business and Economics, United States; email: emm@seattleu.edu",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",03074358,,,,"English","Manag.

This is explained by varied institutional environments in which banking sectors operate, and in which financial crises persist. Therefore, the aim of this study is to prioritize investigation of the regulatory framework in the crisis-response policies across European countries affected by the current financial turmoil. In order to elicit most accurate results and fill in the gap in existing literature on banking crises, the paper aims to focus on both qualitative and quantitative methodological frameworks in order to ensure that the concerns raised by practitioners are addressed and implications for the regulatory processes instrumented. Design/methodology/approach – The emphasis of the current study has been laid to flag the region- and country-specific vulnerabilities in regulatory framework employed for banking crisis recovery. Additional focus has been put on groups of systemic risk which evolved from the current financial crisis and ways these risks can be ameliorated. Furthermore, the current paper strives to explore the ideas of ways to ameliorate negative outcomes of the global crisis and mitigate common risks with reference to the flawed regulations. Especially, important issues have been raised by the interviewed experts who put forward their opinions on the ways of lifting the regulatory shortcomings and costs of remedies identified in the study and who provided solutions to ensuring the financial stability of European capital markets. Findings – The study highlighted areas of regulations that require immediate attention and which failed to prevent financial markets from the current banking crisis. These findings are then summarized with constructive proposals on how to amend banking sector and financial regulations. The study also provides a cross-European comparison of the financial crisis-recovery policies, evaluating solutions adopted in various selected European countries. Henceforth, the empirical model tested the possibility of a tradeoff existing between remedies which involve substantial public funds and exert burden on both fiscal balances and taxpayers, and the speed and effectiveness of the recovery processes. To this point, no tradeoff has been found. Moreover, contrasting the current banking crisis to the past financial market disturbances, highlighted the magnitude of the nascent economic downturn prevailing in Europe. Originality/value – Since the existing body of literature abounds in studies devoted to investigations of the causes for the current banking crisis, the research focus of this paper has been shifted away from the factors and flawed regulations that trigger banking crises. To this point, the paper has traits of pioneering work. © 2011, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banking; Financial crisis; Financial markets; International finance; Recovery policies",,"Prorokowski, L.; University of AberdeenUnited Kingdom; email: r05lp9@abdn.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17554179,,,,"English","Qual.

It particularly aims to explore if the structure of the financial systems changes when the economy enters a recession. The empirical analysis is conducted through the statistical approach of principal components analysis (PCA) and the graph theoretic approach of minimum spanning trees (MSTs). The PCA results suggest that the VIX was the dominant factor influencing the financial system prior to the recession; however, the monetary policy represented by the three-month T-bill yield became the leading factor in the system during the recession. By analyzing the MSTs, we find evidence that the structure of the financial system during the economic recession is substantially different from that during the period of economic expansion. Moreover, we discover that the financial markets are more integrated during the economic recession. The much stronger integration of the financial system was found to start right before the advent of the recession. Research findings will help individuals, institutions, regulators, central bankers better understand the market structure under the economic turmoil, so more efficient strategies can be used to minimize the systemic risk. This study compares the structure of the US financial markets in economic expansion and contraction periods. The structural dynamics of the financial system are explored, focusing on the recent economic recession triggered by the US subprime mortgage crisis.

While state bailouts were politically sensitive, policy-makers had little alternative but to supply funds to financial institutions that were viewed as 'too big to fail', or TBTF. In this paper, I review the history of, and the rationale for, the TBTF policy. I argue that, from a policy perspective, the most important costs of the TBTF problem are incurred ex ante, in the form of distorted incentives that arise as a consequence of distortions to the capital markets, and to the choice of banks' scale and scope. I argue that it is impossible credibly to withdraw the TBTF policy, and, hence, that it should be managed so as to minimize the costs of these distortions. In this context, I discuss the role of policy in institutional design, in the restriction of bank scope, and in designing appropriate capital regulations. © The Author 2012.

This, combined with short funding cycles, encourages extractive assessments of individualized vulnerability; responses based on delivering individual packages of household assets; and only superficial consideration of power relationships. By analogy with urban infrastructure provision, this paper argues that narrow interpretation of the sustainable livelihoods framework applied to urban analysis gives only limited insights into the systemic risks faced by urban dwellers. Using an analysis of infrastructure that draws on the idea of splintering urbanism, a process by which urban infrastructure tends to privilege some and bypass others, the paper develops a visual framework for considering the interdependence of urban livelihoods, physical infrastructure and the organizing tendencies of powerful service providers. The paper concludes that in the cases where it is not possible to identify the most vulnerable (e.g. in dense, heterogeneous cities) or where it is possible only to identify the most vulnerable but not to deliver asset packages to them (e.g. transitional shelter kits that cannot be received by people without access to a plot), humanitarian activities risk reinforcing the systemic, underlying causes of vulnerability. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Infrastructure; Resilience; Risk reduction; Sustainable development; Urban livelihoods","humanitarian aid; infrastructural development; international aid; megacity; sustainable development; urban economy; urbanization; vulnerability","Crawford, C.A.; CARE International UK, 10-13 Rushworth Street, SE1 0RB, London, United Kingdom; email: crawford@careinternational.org",,,17477891,,ENHAF,,"English","Environ.

It is likely to trigger disastrous chain of domino effect accident. One of the main reasons for such phenomena is that we lack general recognition to risk management. The current systems of risk management in the chemical industry park are not perfect, they are waiting for the further explored and improved. As a starting point from the above, this paper selects a specific chemical industry park for the study object, and establishes the risk management systems of the chemical industry park which are suitable and operable for our country conditions. It can implement the scientific, effective and systemic risk management for the chemical industry park and avoid, control, reduce the casualties, property losses and environment damage as soon as possible, promote the safe development for the chemical industry park. © 2011 IEEE.","chemical industry park; emergency magagement; risk management","Chemical industry parks; Chemical park; Chemicals leakage; Current system; Development trends; Domino effects; Economic development; emergency magagement; Hazardous chemicals; Local economy; Long-term development; Major accidents; Major hazards; Petrochemical enterprise; Property loss; Risk management systems; Safety issues; Accident prevention; Accidents; Chemical industry; Economic and social effects; Economics; Explosives; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Information management; Parks; Risk management; Industrial management","Zhou, D.; School of Environment and Civil Engineering, , Wuhan, China",,,,9781612841069,,,"English","BMEI - Proc.

Highly sensitive exploration systems using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods have been developed to detect neuroblastoma cells. In our series of 49 patients with advanced neuroblastoma, circulating tumor cells (CTC) were detected by this system in 55.6% of the stage 4 patients who were examined, suggesting that the primary lesion may release tumor cells into the peripheral blood. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was significantly lower among the patients with CTC or chemotherapy-insensitive bone marrow micrometastasis, compared with those without detectable micrometastasis (33.8 vs. 87.5%, P<0.05). In contrast, a stage 3 patient with MYCN amplification exhibited drastic local relapse without systemic dissemination of the disease. Two patients were positive for CTC without an identifiable primary site. These observations indicate that the local growth of the primary tumor and tumor cell dissemination may be regulated by different molecular mechanisms in neuroblastomas. MYCN amplification seemed to be more closely associated with localized tumor growth but was minimally correlated with CTC positivity. High-risk neuroblastoma may include two separate subgroups characterized by different cellular kinetics: a local risk cohort and a systemic risk cohort. Surgical strategies for neuroblastoma should be determined with taking this cellular kinetics into consideration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Cellular kinetics; Circulating tumor cell; Micrometastasis; Neuroblastoma; Surgery","bone marrow metastasis; cancer localization; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cell kinetics; circulating tumor cell; clinical article; controlled study; high risk patient; human; human cell; micrometastasis; molecular mechanics; neuroblastoma; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; review; survival rate; tumor cell; tumor growth; Child; Humans; Neoplasm Micrometastasis; Neuroblastoma","Kuroda, T.; Department of Pediatric Surgery, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan; email: kuroda-t@z8.keio.jp",,,01790358,,PSUIE,"21769682","English","Pediatr.

A great deal supports the fact that in some sectors of European agriculture, in future agricultural entrepreneurs will have to deal more with risk management, in particular the trend towards increasing price and yield risks with their respective consequences for the farmers' income. One fundamental insight from the previous considerations is that handling price and yield risks is primarily the job of the entrepreneur, which must be dealt with in view of the local requirements, the specific risk exposition and the individually perceived risk. Collective, sector-wide stabilization instruments, such as previous EU agricultural policy with intervention prices, state warehousing and variable export restitutions or import absorptions do not live up to this task. They are not targeted enough and incur unjustifiably high fiscal and national economic costs. The failure and the reduction of these traditional market regulation instruments therefore not only triggered a fundamental debate about the role of government in the risk management of agricultural entrepreneurs, but also intensified the search for targeted, state promotional measures accompanying private economic commitments. The suggested subsidization of premiums for harvest damage insurance even in Germany is an example of handling yield risks. In cases of price risks and their consequences for income there are additionally other proposals such as a risk equalization reserve, greater regulation of commodity futures markets and retention of direct payments as income stabilizing elements. 49. In overall risk management the state's task should be to ensure that single entrepreneurs are provided with as broad a spectrum as possible of both internal and external private risk management instruments. Risk exposition and risk aversion are heterogeneous for individual farms and persons, making any collective set of instruments or singled out state support of one single private-business instrument crowd out other options or instruments and thus economically inefficient. This basically speaks for support measures with a sense of proportion and time limits as well as for strengthening market forces through supporting information, creating transparency and providing infrastructure. With regard to the current proposals on the role of government in handling yield and price risks and in consideration of the arguments presented, the Advisory Board reaches the following recommendations. 50. The Advisory Board deems long-term subsidization of multiple-risk insurance, as practiced in the USA and some EU member states, financially and economically unjustifiable. Practice shows that the valid economic insurance principle is given up for risk management instruments and purely transfer instruments evolve. The Board does, however, think the state should take action for typical systemic risks such as drought and flooding with previously unknown probability distributions for their incidence (so-called real uncertainties). 51. A chronologically diminishing, sliding premium subsidy for drought risks that would expire after an adequate period of time could help to lower the high market introduction costs of insurance products, to correct the systematic underestimation of these climate-related risks on behalf of the farmers and to gather more information about the quantity and extent of such extreme weather events. Such a temporary premium subsidy as market introduction aid could be set up under the second pillar in compliance with the WTO under the category ""new challenges"" and appropriately co-financed as the most recent proposal of the EU Commission for the CAP after 2013 also envisages. The previous provision whereby member states may grant co-financed subsidies for insurance premiums in the scope of their target ceilings for direct payments (first pillar) would have to be dissolved. Setting up this support measure under the second CAP pillar would have the advantage that in some countries experience could initially be gained in terms of a pilot project and considerations made with other stabilizations measures of the second pillar and, if successful, these could be transferred to further regions. The Advisory Board considers state participation in the privately managed reinsurance business beyond a specific insured sum or a blend of premium subsidies and reinsurance activities by the government a possible alternative. The premium relief for farmers would largely be equal to the effect of a pure premium subsidy. Differences would only result for the tax authorities with regard to amount, frequency and occurrence probability of necessary payments. Perhaps the Länder in cooperation with the insurance industry could also be allowed to decide what form of state grant they wish to implement. 52. The Advisory Board deems the introduction of a purely state drought fund, e.g. from funds of the first CAP pillar, without the participation of the insurance industry and tied to a weather index as problematic. Unlike private insurance policies, state fund solutions would probably not be able to contain any liability guarantees and short funds in the EU budget could then make insurance protection quite questionable. For the rest, pure index-based solutions lead away from the insurance business principle, whereby actual, individual damages should be compensated. By contrast solutions using weather derivatives inevitably lead to over- or under-compensation if an additional loss appraisal by professionals is not conducted, as for example in the Austrian model. 53. EU state aid law was established in order to avoid intra-Community distortions of competition. It monitors national unilateral routes and defines in some cases strict ceilings for admissible benefits, as in the agricultural sector, with the objective of gradual Community-wide harmonization of subsidy and fiscal legislation. Therefore, the 19% taxation of multiple-risk insurance policies in Germany alongside tax relief and tax exemptions in other EU member states should be seen critically. Nevertheless, in Germany the fiscal policy principle of equal treatment of sectors and products applies, which allows for only a few exceptional cases. Since the Advisory Board is fundamentally critical of special sector-specific provisions in other cases as well, it recommends that the 19% insurance tax be retained for multiple-risk insurance in Germany and that tax benefits in other EU countries be abolished. 54. In addition to traditional EU market regulation policies, state direct disaster aid has proven an effective constraint for the establishment of adequate private insurance solutions. Therefore, we should speak up for abolishing such aid. However, we cannot seriously assume that politics would waiver this instrument, especially in the case of entirely new damage events. The Advisory Board therefore recommends continuing to apply the existing provision of at first cutting the maximum rates of compensation for direct aid by 50% and later to examine the 50%. 55. The Advisory Board does not consider the proposed risk equalization reserve as a substitute for crop insurance, because it is meant more to serve towards smoothing basically positive incomes and not towards avoiding economic situations that threaten farmers' livelihoods. We do, however, continue to have doubts with regard to compatibility with EU state aid law and the WTO provisions as well as the fiscally different treatment of different holdings within agriculture and the establishment of new special circumstances for agriculture. Only when these doubts are eliminated could we consider the introduction of a risk equalization reserve as a supplemental instrument for income smoothing, however not as a sector-specific but as a general fiscal policy measure. The Scientific Advisory Board is against the introduction of a sector-specific risk equalization reserve. 56. The Advisory Board is critical of reinterpreting direct payments as an instrument of risk management in the sense of income stabilization. It is beyond dispute that direct payments trigger a shift in income levels and therefore lessen the probability for falling below the subsistence level. Yet for this instrument the same main objection applies as for classical market regulation policies that it is not tailored to the specific risk situation of single holdings and farm operators, but on the one hand is effective collectively and across-the-board and on the other hand does not encompass certain production areas at all. For the rest, the level stabilizing effect can be lessened through shifts and, under certain conditions, even be entirely eliminated. 57. The Advisory Board is critical of stricter regulation of commodity futures markets with the aim of market price stabilization, as presently proposed by scientists for international agricultural commodities markets (global virtual reserve) and also by two EU commissioners for the EU markets. Dynamic price ceilings and price floors for futures prices cannot be defined by governments or experts to eliminate alleged excessive speculation. For the rest, the destabilizing effect of excessive speculation on the futures markets on spot prices has not yet been empirically proven. Further research is needed here. To derive far-reaching intervention in the pricing mechanism based on the present findings is not justified according to the Advisory Board. Rather, it sees the danger that such interventions will be misused for distributional policy purposes. Historical experiences with international market and price stabilization policies are also rather negative. Professional handling of price risks ultimately is one of the core tasks of entrepreneurs in market economy systems. This also applies to the agricultural and food industries. Some segments of the agricultural sector prove quite clearly that this can be mastered successfully.",,,,,,00059080,,,,"German","Ber. Landwirtsch.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052703342

Design: Retrospective, observational study. Participants: Sixty-nine patients with glaucoma with an isolated IPFS and 53 patients with an isolated INS. Methods: On the basis of 2 reliable, consistent 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm standard visual fields (VFs), 2 groups of patients with glaucoma were studied: those with an IPFS in 1 hemifield (<3 adjacent points with P < 5% within the central 10 degrees of fixation, <1 point with P < 1% lying at the innermost paracentral points, and no VF abnormality outside the central 10 degrees) and those with an INS in 1 hemifield (<3 adjacent points with P < 5% in the nasal periphery outside 10 degrees of fixation, the nasal-most point with P < 1%, and no VF abnormality within the central 10 degrees). Clinical characteristics and systemic factors were recorded from charts and compared between the 2 groups. Main Outcome Measures: Maximum untreated intraocular pressure (IOP), disc hemorrhage (DH) detection during follow-up, systemic risk factors, and VF mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD). Results: Maximum untreated IOP (21.6±4.5 vs. 28.3±9.6 mmHg; P < 0.001) was significantly lower, and frequency of DH detection (44% vs. 17%; P=0.001) and systemic risk factors (hypotension, migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, and sleep apnea; 16%, 23%, 24%, and 9% vs. 0%, 4%, 9%, and 0%; P=0.001, 0.002, 0.025, and 0.030, respectively) were significantly higher in patients with an IPFS than in patients with an INS. There were no significant differences in age, gender, family history of glaucoma, refractive error, central corneal thickness, and disc area between the 2 groups (all P > 0.1). Mean deviation was similar between the 2 groups (P=0.346), but PSD was significantly greater in the IPFS group than in the INS group (P=0.043). Conclusions: Eyes with an IPFS differ from those with an INS. These findings may help clinicians identify patients at higher risk of early central field loss.

As the literature points out, the impact of systemic risk can be closely related to issues of concentration (“too big to fail”) and dependency (“too connected to fail”). However, different structural variables are emphasized in various ways, and most authors analyze each variable separately. This raises the questions of how structural fragility, as a cause of systemic distress, can be assessed more comprehensively and consistently, and what the implications are for modeling it within an integrated systemic risk framework. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – On the basis of theoretical considerations and in the light of current transformations in financial markets, this paper explores elements of structural fragility and the requirements for modeling them. Findings – The paper suggests an extended approach for conceptualizing structural fragility, evaluates directions for quantifying structural issues in early warning systems (EWSs) for systemic crises, and lays a theoretical groundwork for further empirical studies. Originality/value – The need for supervisory actions to prevent crises is urgent, as is the need for integrating structural aspects into EWSs for systemic financial crises. Since a significant aspect of a financial firm's risk comes from outside the firm, individual institutions should understand and monitor the structural aspects of the various risk networks they are in. © 2011, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banks; Financial market vulnerability; Financial markets; Systemic risk; Systemic risk capital",,"Gramlich, D.; Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State UniversityGermany; email: gramlich@dhbw-heidenheim.de",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",15265943,,,,"English","J.

Many proposals for financial reform address the need for systemic regulation - that is, regulation focused on the soundness of the whole financial system and not just that of individual institutions. In this paper, we study one particular problem faced by a systemic regulator: the tension between the distribution of assets that individual banks would like to hold and the distribution across banks that best supports system stability if greater weight is given to avoiding multiple bank failures. By diversifying its risks, a bank lowers its own probability of failure. However, if many banks diversify their risks in similar ways, then the probability of multiple failures can increase. As more banks fail simultaneously, the economic disruption tends to increase disproportionately. We show that, in model systems, the expected systemic cost of multiple failures can be largely explained by two global parameters of risk exposure and diversity, which can be assessed in terms of the risk exposures of individual actors. This observation hints at the possibility of regulatory intervention to promote systemic stability by incentivizing a more diverse diversification among banks. Such intervention offers the prospect of an additional lever in the armory of regulators, potentially allowing some combination of improved system stability and reduced need for additional capital.","Financial regulation; Financial stability; Global financial markets","article; economic aspect; finance; financial management; model; priority journal; probability; risk; Algorithms; Costs and Cost Analysis; Economics; Humans; Income; Models, Economic; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors","Nowak, M.A.; Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, , Cambridge, MA 02138, United States; email: martin_nowak@harvard.edu",,,00278424,,PNASA,"21768387","English","Proc.

It also highlighted the enormous direct and indirect costs of addressing systemic crises after they have occurred, as opposed to attempting to prevent them from arising. Governments and international organizations are responding with measures intended to make the financial system more resilient to economic shocks, many of which will be implemented by regulatory bodies over time. These measures suffer, however, from the lack of a theoretical account of how systemic risk propagates within the financial system and why regulatory intervention is needed to disrupt it. In this Article, we address this deficiency by examining how systemic risk is transmitted. We then proceed to explain why, in the absence of regulation, market participants cannot be relied upon to disrupt or otherwise limit the transmission of systemic risk.

Econometric approaches to measuring long-term risk are developed in order to estimate the term structure of value at risk and expected shortfall. Long-term negative skewness increases the downside risk and is a consequence of asymmetric volatility models. A test is developed for long-term skewness. In a Merton style structural default model, bankruptcies are accompanied by substantial drops in equity prices. Thus, skewness in amarket factor implies high defaults and default correlations even far in the future corroborating the systemic importance of long-term skewness. Investors concerned about long-term risks may hedge exposure as in the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM). As a consequence, the aggregate wealth portfolio should have asymmetric volatility and hedge portfolios should have reversed asymmetric volatility. Using estimates from VLAB, reversed asymmetric volatility is found for many possible hedge portfolios such as volatility products, long- and shortterm treasuries, some exchange rates, and gold. © The Author 2011.

On the whole, such simulations suggest that contagious defaults are unlikely but cannot be fully ruled out, at least in some countries. If contagion does take place, then it could lead to the breakdown of a substantial fraction of the banking system, thus imposing high costs to society. However, when interpreting these results, one has to bear in mind the potential bias caused by the very strong assumptions underlying the simulations. Robustness tests indicate that the models might be able to correctly predict whether or not contagion could be an issue and, possibly, also identify banks whose failure could give rise to contagion. They are, however, less suited for stress testing or for the analysis of policy options in crises, primarily due to their lack of behavioural foundations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Contagion; Domino effects; Interbank lending; Systemic risk",,"Upper, C.; Bank for International Settlements, , Basel, Switzerland; email: christian.upper@bis.org",,,15723089,,,,"English","J.

As monetary circuit theory shows, banks are special, insofar as they can grant loans without the need to dispose of preexistent bank deposits. When the loans-generate-deposits causal chain occurs on the factor market, for firms to pay the wage bill, the money-output relation is not affected by banks' intermediation. This relation is modified when banks exploit the loans-generate-deposits mechanism for any financial market transactions, whether for their clients or for their own sake. Financial liberalization and deregulation pushed banks to compete with nonbank financial institutions, for them to retain their market share, reducing both their markup on monetary policy rates of interest and the credit standard they used to apply to firms as well as households. In that process, banks have, therefore, become ""financial supermarkets,"" engaged first and foremost in investment banking, which is a misnomer, because, in fact, it has nothing to do with investment properly speaking: it is speculation on ""global"" financial markets, which are indeed far from providing any support to productive investment within the economic system. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","bank money; financial crisis; payment systems; systemic risk",,"Rossi, S.; University of FribourgSwitzerland",,"Routledge",15580970,,,,"English","Int.

After the 2008 financial crisis, a significant amount of effort has been directed to the study of systemic risk and its consequences around the world. Although it is very difficult to predict when people begin to lose confidence in a financial system, it is possible to model the relationships among the stock markets of different countries and perform a Monte Carlo-type analysis to study the contagion effect. Because some larger and stronger markets influence smaller ones, a model inspired by a catalytic chemical model is proposed. In chemical reactions, reagents with higher concentrations tend to favor their conversion to products. In order to modulate the conversion process, catalyzers may be used. In this work, a mathematical modeling is proposed with bases on the catalytic chemical reaction model. More specifically, the Hang Seng and Dow Jones indices are assumed to dominate Ibovespa (the Brazilian Stock Market index), such that the indices of strong markets are taken as being analogous to the concentrations of the reagents and the indices of smaller markets as concentrations of products. The role of the catalyst is to model the degree of influence of one index on another. The actual data used to fit the model parameter consisted of the Hang Seng index, Dow Jones index, and Ibovespa, since 1993.

The paper then analyzes market breakdowns due to either adverse selection or shortages of financial muscle, and explains why such breakdowns are endogenous to balance sheet choices and to information acquisition. It then looks at what economics can contribute to the debate on systemic risk and its containment. Finally, the paper takes a macroeconomic perspective, discusses shortages of aggregate liquidity, and analyzes how market value accounting and capital adequacy should react to asset prices. It concludes with a topical form of liquidity provision, monetary bailouts and recapitalizations, and analyzes optimal combinations thereof; it stresses the need for macro-prudential policies.",,,"Tirole, J.; Toulouse School of EconomicsFrance",,,00220515,,,,"English","J.

These crises (new technology bubbles, the sub-prime crisis ...) have led economists and financial analysts to the following conclusions. First of all, systemic risk has increased during the last 30 years, which had led regulators to devise rules to evaluate information more efficiently. Second, the recent collapse of stock markets despite the national rescue measures shows the importance of preventative procedures. The third point is that aggressive capitalism has demonstrated its limits. The aim of this paper is to show that regulation is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensure the efficiency of banking institutions, financial markets and the management of companies. Design/methodology/approach: Through the analysis of the Swiss banking sector, the paper provides an insight for banks to satisfy social pressure on more ethical behavior. This case could be an example for another functioning for financial institutions. Findings: By refocusing on their core business, banking institutions will be capable of realizing profit and creating value for the community. Practical implications: The arguments discussed in this paper could be of interest both for professionals and academics willing to solve the antagonism between profit and ethics: profit can be compatible with social value added. Originality/value: Banking and finance is not ""an ethics free zone"". By changing their behavior, banks can improve their credibility on the market and renew the confidence towards clients. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banks; Business ethics; Economic fluctuations; Regulation",,"Paulet, E.; ESCEM, Poitiers, France; email: epaulet@escem.fr",,,14720701,,,,"English","Corp.

We study the systematic risk of banks before the crisis, using two samples of banks respectively trading Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this decomposition shows that the increase in the beta is solely due to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater systemic risk.

Systemic risk is best addressed ex ante, but no regulatory regime can credibly eliminate systemic risk, so ex post crisis response is unavoidable. Bailouts of troubled firms have long been the standard ex post response to systemic risk. Yet, bailouts suffer from problems of political legitimacy. Bankruptcy is often presented as a more legitimate alternative to bailouts because its loss allocation system is preset and determined in the abstract. This Article argues that the choice between bailouts and bankruptcy is illusory. Bailouts and bankruptcy are not alternative choices but an integrated system; any preset resolution system will be abandoned for a bailout if it would produce socially unacceptable loss allocations. Therefore, bailouts' political legitimacy is critical. Accordingly, the Article proposes a framework for analyzing bailouts' legitimacy by turning to the institutional design of bailouts. It identifies and explores two fundamental questions involved in all bailouts. First, should bailouts be done ad hoc through Congress or should bailout authority be institutionalized in an agency? And second, should creditors of bailed-out firms be forced to accept less than full payment (or take a ""haircut"") as part of the bailout? Ensuring accountability and fairness in resolving these issues is essential for bailouts' political legitimacy and ultimate efficacy. © 2011.",,,"Levitin, A.

Materials and Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study carried out over a period of 2 years, type 2 diabetic patients seeking ocular evaluation for DR were assessed for presence and severity of DR, presence of hard exudates and CSME. Retinal findings were correlated to severity of microalbuminuria, hemoglobin concentration and other systemic risk factors using linear regression analysis. Results: Three hundred and six patients were included in the study. DR of any grade was seen in 132 (43%) patients, hard exudate formation in 93/306 (30.4%) patients, CSME in 50/306 (16.3%) patients and proliferative DR in 26/306 (8.5%) patients. Duration of diabetes (P < 0.001), microalbuminuria (P < 0.001) and low hemoglobin (P = 0.001) were found to be highly significant risk factors for the development and increasing severity of DR as well as for CSME and hard exudate formation. Conclusion: Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin are strong predictors for DR, CSME and hard exudate formation in type 2 diabetics even after correcting for duration of diabetes and other systemic risk factors. Although not directly involved in the pathogenesis, microalbuminuria can help in identifying patients at risk for more severe diabetic eye disease. Microalbuminuria warrants intensive monitoring of both retinal and renal status. The hemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly in diabetic patients to detect and treat anemia, thereby reducing one risk factor for DR.","Anemia; diabetic retinopathy; microalbuminuria; severity","hemoglobin; adult; aged; albuminuria; anemia; article; blood; cross-sectional study; diabetic retinopathy; exudate; female; hospitalization; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; prospective study; retina macula edema; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albuminuria; Anemia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Exudates and Transudates; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Linear Models; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","Nithyanandam, S.; Department of Ophthalmology, , Bangalore - 560 034, India; email: uneetha.n.lobo@gmail.com",,,03014738,,IJOMB,"21586841","English","Indian J.

Failure probabilities can be controlled if a decisionmaker is able to set the threshold at an appropriate level. This abstract situation applies, for example, to environmental risks with infrastructure controls; to supply chain risks with inventory controls; and to insurance solvency risks with capital controls. However, uncertainty around the distribution of the risk factor implies that parameter error will be present and the measures taken to control failure probabilities may not be effective. We show that parameter uncertainty increases the probability (understood as expected frequency) of failures. For a large class of loss distributions, arising from increasing transformations of location-scale families (including the log-normal, Weibull, and Pareto distributions), the article shows that failure probabilities can be exactly calculated, as they are independent of the true (but unknown) parameters. Hence it is possible to obtain an explicit measure of the effect of parameter uncertainty on failure probability. Failure probability can be controlled in two different ways: (1) by reducing the nominal required failure probability, depending on the size of the available data set, and (2) by modifying of the distribution itself that is used to calculate the risk control. Approach (1) corresponds to a frequentist/regulatory view of probability, while approach (2) is consistent with a Bayesian/personalistic view. We furthermore show that the two approaches are consistent in achieving the required failure probability. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of data pooling and its systemic risk implications. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.","Insurance; Location-scale families; Parameter uncertainty; Solvency; Value at risk","Capital control; Control failure; Data pooling; Data sets; Decision makers; Effect of parameters; Environmental risks; Failure Probability; Frequentist; Large class; Location-scale families; Log-normal; Loss distribution; Parameter error; Parameter uncertainty; Pareto distributions; Risk controls; Risk factors; Solvency; Supply chain risk; Value at risk; Weibull; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Weibull distribution; capital market; data set; decision making; environmental risk; frequency analysis; infrastructure; insurance industry; insurance system; measurement method; parameterization; risk factor; threshold; uncertainty analysis; valuation; apparatus, equipment and supplies; article; financial management; flooding; probability; risk assessment; theoretical model; uncertainty; Equipment and Supplies; Financial Management; Floods; Models, Theoretical; Probability; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty","Tsanakas, A.; Cass Business School, 106 Bunhill Row, London, EC1Y 8TZ, United Kingdom; email: a.tsanakas.1@city.ac.uk",,,02724332,,RIAND,"21175720","English","Risk Anal.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956127310

It has sharply increased reserves to the banking system through open market operations and lowered the federal funds rate and discount rate on several occasions. Since December 2008, it has allowed the federal funds rate to fall close to zero. As the crisis deepened, the Fed's focus shifted to providing liquidity directly to the financial system through new policy tools. Through new credit facilities, the Fed first expanded the scale of its lending to the banking system and then extended direct lending to non-bank financial firms. The latter marked the first time since the Great Depression that firms that are not banks or members of the Federal Reserve System have been allowed to borrow directly from the Fed. After the crisis worsened in September 2008, the Fed began providing credit directly to markets for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. All of these emergency facilities had expired by the end of June 2010, but central bank liquidity swap lines were reopened in May 2010 in response to the crisis in Greece. The Fed also provided emergency assistance to Bear Stearns, AIG, and Citigroup over the course of the crisis; the Fed still holds assets from and loans to AIG and assets from Bear Stearns. These programs resulted in an increase in the Fed's balance sheet of $1.4 trillion at its peak in December 2008, staying relatively steady since then. The Fed's authority and capacity to lend is bound only by fears of the inflationary consequences, which have been partly offset by additional debt issuance by the Treasury. High inflation has not materialized yet because most of the liquidity created by the Fed is being held by banks as excess reserves, but after the economy stabilizes, the Fed may have to scale back its balance sheet rapidly to avoid it. Asset sales could be disruptive, but the Fed has argued that it can contain inflationary pressures through the payment of interest on bank reserves, which it was authorized by Congress to do in 2008. The statutory authority for most of the Fed's recent actions is based on a clause in the Federal Reserve Act to be used in ?unusual or exigent circumstances.? All loans are backed by collateral that reduces the risk of losses. Any losses borne by the Fed from its loans or asset purchases would reduce the income it remits to the Treasury, making the effect on the federal budget similar to if the loans were made directly by Treasury. It is highly unlikely that losses would exceed its other income and capital, and require revenues to be transferred to the Fed from the Treasury. To date, the Fed's crisis activities have increased its net income. Two policy issues raised by the Fed's actions are issues of systemic risk and moral hazard. Moral hazard refers to the phenomenon where actors take on more risk because they are protected. The Fed's involvement in stabilizing Bear Stearns, AIG, and Citigroup stemmed from the fear of systemic risk (that the financial system as a whole would cease to function) if they were allowed to fail. In other words, the firms were seen as ?too big (or too interconnected) to fail.? The Fed regulates member banks to mitigate the moral hazard that stems from access to government protections. Yet Bear Stearns and AIG were not under the Fed's regulatory oversight because they were not member banks. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern that certain details of the Fed's lending activities are kept confidential. H.R. 4173 adds conditions to the Fed's emergency lending authority, removes most GAO audit restrictions, and requires disclosure of the identities of borrowers with a delay. It also changes the Fed's role in the financial regulatory system (see CRS Report R40877, Financial Regulatory Reform: Systemic Risk and the Federal Reserve). © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Derivatives also permit potentially risky speculation on future trends in those rates and prices. Derivatives markets are very large-measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars-and they grew rapidly in the years before the recent financial crisis. The events of the crisis have sparked calls for fundamental reform. Derivatives are traded in two kinds of markets: on regulated exchanges and in an unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) market. During the crisis, the web of risk exposures arising from OTC derivatives contracts complicated the potential failures of major market participants like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG. In deciding whether to provide federal support, regulators had to consider not only the direct impact of those firms failing, but also the effect of any failure on their derivatives counterparties. Because OTC derivatives are unregulated, little information was available about the extent and distribution of possible derivatives-related losses. The OTC market is dominated by a few dozen large financial institutions who act as dealers. Before the crisis, the OTC dealer system was viewed as robust, and as a means for dispersing risk throughout the financial system. The idea that OTC derivatives tend to promote financial stability has been challenged by the crisis, as many of the major dealers required infusions of capital from the government. Derivatives reform legislation before Congress would require the OTC market to adopt some of the practices of the regulated exchange markets, which were able to cope with financial volatility in 2008 without government aid. A central theme of derivatives reform is requiring OTC contracts to be cleared by a central counterparty, or derivatives clearing organization. Clearinghouses remove the credit risk inherent in bilateral OTC contracts by guaranteeing payment on both sides of derivatives contracts. They impose initial margin (or collateral) requirements to cover potential losses initially. They further impose variation margin to cover any additional ongoing potential losses. The purpose of posting margin is to prevent a build-up of uncovered risk exposures like AIG's. Proponents of clearing argue that if AIG had had to post initial margin and variation margin on its trades in credit default swaps, it would likely have run out of money before its position became a systemic threat that resulted in costly government intervention. Benefits of mandatory clearing include greater market transparency, as the clearinghouse monitors, records, and usually confirms trades. Clearing may reduce systemic risk, by mitigating the possibility of nonpayment by counterparties. There are also costs to clearing. Margin requirements impose cash demands on ""end users"" of derivatives, such as nonfinancial firms who used OTC contracts to hedge risk. H.R. 4173, as passed by the House, and Title VII of the same bill, as amended with text from S. 3217 and passed by the Senate on May 20, 2010, provide exemptions from mandatory clearing for certain categories of market participants. If exemptions are too broad, then systemic risks, as well as default risks to dealers and counterparties, may remain. The bills seek to balance the competing goals of reducing systemic risk and preserving end users' ability to hedge risks through derivatives, without causing those derivatives trades to become too costly. This report analyzes the issues of derivatives clearing and margin and end users, and it discusses the various legislative approaches to the end-user issue. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A number of firms used derivatives to construct highly leveraged speculative positions, which generated enormous losses that threatened to bankrupt not only the firms themselves but also their creditors and trading partners. Hundreds of billions of dollars in government credit were needed to prevent such losses from cascading throughout the system. AIG was the best-known example, but by no means the only one. Equally troublesome was the fact that the OTC market depended on the financial stability of a dozen or so major dealers. Failure of a dealer would have resulted in the nullification of trillions of dollars worth of contracts and would have exposed derivatives counterparties to sudden risk and loss, exacerbating the cycle of deleveraging and withholding of credit that characterized the crisis. During the crisis, all the major dealers came under stress, and even though derivatives dealing was not generally the direct source of financial weakness, a collapse of the $600 trillion OTC derivatives market was imminent absent federal intervention. The first group of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. The Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) sought to remake the OTC market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges. Crucial reforms include a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by one or more federal agencies. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash (called initial margin) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses, and require subsequent deposits (called maintenance margin) to cover actual losses to the position. The intended effect of margin requirements is to eliminate the possibility that any firm can build up an uncapitalized exposure so large that default would have systemic consequences (again, the AIG situation). The size of a cleared position is limited by the firm's ability to post capital to cover its losses. That capital protects its trading partners and the system as a whole. Swap dealers and major swap participants-firms with substantial derivatives positions-will be subject to margin and capital requirements above and beyond what the clearinghouses mandate. Swaps that are cleared will also be subject to trading on an exchange, or an exchangelike ""swap execution facility,"" regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the case of security-based swaps. All trades will be reported to data repositories, so that regulators will have complete information about all derivatives positions. Data on swap prices and trading volumes will be made public. The new law provides exceptions to the clearing and trading requirements for commercial end-users, or firms that use derivatives to hedge the risks of their nonfinancial business operations. Regulators may also provide exemptions for smaller financial institutions. Even trades that are exempt from the clearing and exchange-trading requirements, however, will have to be reported to data repositories or directly to regulators. This report describes some of the new requirements placed on the derivatives market by the Dodd-Frank Act. It will not be updated. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the wake of the crisis, lawmakers sought to reduce systemic risk to the financial system by regulating this market. One of the reforms that Congress introduced in the Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) was mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives through clearinghouses, in an effort to remake the OTC market more in the image of the regulated futures exchanges. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash or liquid assets, called margin, to cover potential losses and prevent any firm from building up a large uncapitalized exposure, as happened in the case of the American International Group (AIG). Clearinghouses thus limit the size of a cleared position based on a firm's ability to post margin to cover its potential losses. As lawmakers focused on clearing requirements to reduce systemic risk, concerns also arose as to whether the small number of large swaps dealers in existence-mostly the largest banks-might influence clearinghouses or trading platforms in ways that could undermine the efficacy of the approach. Concerns about conflicts of interest in clearing center around whether, if large swap dealers dominate a clearinghouse, they might directly or indirectly restrict access to the clearinghouse; whether they might limit the scope of derivatives products eligible for clearing; or whether they might influence a clearinghouse to lower margin requirements. Trading in OTC derivatives is in fact concentrated around a dozen or so major dealers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) estimated that, as of the third quarter of 2010, five large commercial banks in the United States represented 96% of the banking industry's total notional amounts of all derivatives; and those five banks represented 81% of the industry's net credit exposure to derivatives. The first group of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. As a result of the high degree of market concentration, the failure of a large swaps dealer still has the potential to result in the nullification of tens of billions of dollars worth of contracts, which could pose a systemic threat. A 2009-proposed amendment proposed to H.R. 4173, which passed the House, would have limited ownership interest and governance of the new derivatives clearinghouses by certain large financial institutions and major swap participants. Sections 726 and 765 in the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act mandate that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), respectively, must adopt rules to mitigate conflicts of interest. However, it allowed the agencies to decide whether those rules include strict numerical limits on ownership or control. In the CFTC's proposed rules to mitigate conflicts of interest, published on October 18, 2010, and on January 6, 2011, the CFTC did choose to adopt strict ownership limits, along the lines of the Lynch amendment. The SEC's proposed rule, published on October 13, 2010, does the same. This report examines how conflicts of interest may arise and analyzes the measures that the CFTC and SEC proposed to address them. It discusses what effect, if any, ownership and control limits may have on derivatives clearing; and whether such limits effectively address the types of conflicts of interest that are of concern to some in the 112th Congress. These rulemakings may interest the 112th Congress as part of its oversight authority for the CFTC and SEC. Trends in clearing and trading derivatives, and the ownership of swap clearinghouses, are discussed in the Appendix. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Second, what powers should be given to macroprudential authorities and what should be their mandate? Third, how can governance arrangements ensure that macroprudential policies are pursued effectively?

The term 'risk governance' involves the translation of the substance and core principles of governance to the context of risk-related decision-making. Does it involve a major change on how risks are conceptualized, managed, and communicated, or it is just a new fashion? In this paper, we aim to delineate the genesis and analytical scope of risk governance. In our view, risk governance pertains to the various ways in which many actors, individuals, and institutions, public and private, deal with risks surrounded by uncertainty, complexity, and/or ambiguity. It emphasizes that not all risks are simple; they cannot be calculated as a function of probability and effect. It is more than a descriptive shorthand for a complex, interacting network in which collective binding decisions are taken around a particular set of societal issues. The ambition is that risk governance provides a conceptual as well as normative basis for how to deal responsibly with uncertain, complex, and/or ambiguous risks in particular. We propose to synthesize the body of scholarly ideas and proposals on the governance of systemic risks in a set of principles: the communication and inclusion principle, the integration principle, and the reflection principle. This set of principles should be read as a synthesis of what needs to be seriously considered in organizing structures and processes to govern risks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","ambiguity; complexity; paradigm shift; risk governance; uncertainty","ambiguity; complexity; paradigm shift; risk governance; uncertainty; Decision making; Public risks","Van Asselt, M.

Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Participants: Seventy-nine patients with unilateral RVO and 71 age-matched control subjects. Methods: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-measured RNFL thickness parameters (average, 4 quadrant, and 12 clock-hour thicknesses) were compared between unaffected eyes of patients with unilateral RVO and single randomly selected eyes of control subjects. Main Outcome Measures: Optical coherence tomography-measured RNFL thickness. Results: In the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RVO, the mean intraocular pressure was 13.7±2.5 mmHg and the RNFL thickness was significantly thinner than in controls in the 10 and 11 o'clock sectors. In a subgroup analysis, which only included subjects aged more than 60 years, the global average and 7 and 11 o'clock sector thicknesses were significantly thinner than in controls.

Conclusions: In the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RVO, RNFL thickness was decreased, especially in the inferior- and superior-temporal sectors, compared with that of control eyes. Difference between the groups also was noticeable on the visual field testing. These results suggest that RVO and glaucoma may share systemic risk factors reflecting a common pathogenic mechanism.

In order to further our understanding and communication about systemic risk management (SRM) in financial institutions, this paper proposes a knowledge level model (KLM) for systemic risk management in financial institutions. There are two parts considered in the proposed KLM: ontologies and problem solving method (PSM). Ontologies are adopted to represent a knowledge base of KLM, which integrates top level ontology and domain level ontologies. And then the problem solving method is given to show the reasoning process of this knowledge. The symbol level of KLM is also discussed which integrates OWL, SWRL and JESS. Further, the discussion about Lehman Brother's Minibonds case in 2008 is provided to illustrate how proposed KLM is used in practice. With these, first, they will enhance the interchange of information and knowledge sharing for SRM within a financial institution. Second, they will assist knowledge base development for SRM design, for which a prototype of financial systemic risk management decision support system is given in this study.

The lesson some policymakers have taken from this crisis is that a systemic risk or -macroprudential"" regulator is needed to prevent similar episodes in the future. But what types of risk would this new regulator be tasked with preventing, and is it the case that those activities are currently unsupervised? Some of the major financial market phenomena that have been identified as posing systemic risk include liquidity problems; -too big to fail"" or -systemically important"" firms; the cycle of rising leverage followed by rapid deleverage; weaknesses in payment, settlement, and clearing systems; and asset bubbles. At the time of the crisis, the Federal Reserve (Fed) already regulated bank holding companies and financial holding companies for capital and liquidity requirements, and it could influence their behavior in markets that it did not regulate. In addition, the Fed directly regulated or operated in some payment, settlement, and clearing systems. Many systemically significant firms are already regulated by the Fed because they are bank holding companies, although some may exist in what is referred to as the shadow banking system, which was largely free of federal regulation for safety and soundness. The Fed's monetary policy mandate was broad enough to allow it to prick asset bubbles, although it has not chosen to do so. Neither the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) nor other existing regulators had the authority to address gaps in existing regulation that they believed pose systemic risk. Opponents of giving regulators new systemic risk responsibilities argue that the crisis did not occur because regulators lacked the necessary authority to prevent it, but because they used their authority poorly and failed to identify systemic risk until it was too late. They fear that greater regulation of financial markets will lead to moral hazard problems that increase systemic risk. The recent crisis has demonstrated that government intervention may become unavoidable, however, even when firms or markets are not explicitly regulated or protected by the government. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 4173, P.L. 111-203) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Provisions of this legislation involving the Federal Reserve and systemic risk are discussed in this report. The act creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) to identify (but not rectify) emerging threats and regulatory gaps. It authorizes the Fed to regulate systemically significant firms identified by the Council for safety and soundness. If the Secretary of the Treasury believes that a failure of a firm would threaten financial stability, the firm can be placed in receivership. It prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading, limits their ability to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds, and authorizes the Fed to regulate those activities at systemically significant firms. It also authorizes the Fed to regulate certain payment, clearing, or settlement systems identified as systemically significant by the Council. To prevent assistance to failing firms, it limits the Fed's authority to lend to non-banks in emergencies and requires more oversight and disclosure of Federal Reserve activities. It imposes minimum capital requirements on a greater array of institutions and calls for capital requirements to be made counter-cyclical. It attempts to move more derivatives into clearinghouses and exchanges. Although the act could be portrayed as an expansion of the Fed's powers, the legislation also strips the Fed of certain powers, such as consumer financial protection responsibilities, and creates new checks on other powers, such as requirements to obtain approval from the Council or the Treasury Secretary before undertaking certain decisions. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A number of firms used derivatives to construct highly leveraged speculative positions, which generated enormous losses that threatened to bankrupt not only the firms themselves but also their creditors and trading partners. Hundreds of billions of dollars in government credit were needed to prevent such losses from cascading throughout the system. AIG was the best-known example, but by no means the only one. Equally troublesome was the fact that the OTC market depended on the financial stability of a dozen or so major dealers. Failure of a dealer would have resulted in the nullification of trillions of dollars worth of contracts and would have exposed derivatives counterparties to sudden risk and loss, exacerbating the cycle of deleveraging and withholding of credit that characterized the crisis. During the crisis, all the major dealers came under stress, and even though derivatives dealing was not generally the direct source of financial weakness, a collapse of the $600 trillion OTC derivatives market was imminent absent federal intervention. The first group of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. The Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) sought to remake the OTC market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges. Crucial reforms include a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by one or more federal agencies. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash (called initial margin) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses, and require subsequent deposits (called maintenance margin) to cover actual losses to the position. The intended effect of margin requirements is to eliminate the possibility that any firm can build up an uncapitalized exposure so large that default would have systemic consequences (again, the AIG situation). The size of a cleared position is limited by the firm's ability to post capital to cover its losses. That capital protects its trading partners and the system as a whole. Swap dealers and major swap participants-firms with substantial derivatives positions-will be subject to margin and capital requirements above and beyond what the clearinghouses mandate. Swaps that are cleared will also be subject to trading on an exchange, or an exchange-like ""swap execution facility,"" regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the case of security-based swaps. All trades will be reported to data repositories, so that regulators will have complete information about all derivatives positions. Data on swap prices and trading volumes will be made public. The new law provides exceptions to the clearing and trading requirements for commercial end-users, or firms that use derivatives to hedge the risks of their nonfinancial business operations. Regulators may also provide exemptions for smaller financial institutions. Even trades that are exempt from the clearing and exchange-trading requirements, however, will have to be reported to data repositories or directly to regulators. This report describes some of the new requirements placed on the derivatives market by the Dodd-Frank Act. It will not be updated. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The clinical picture is typically characterized by very painful skin lesions and ulcerations following calcification and occlusion of small cutaneous arterioles. CUA is life-threatening due to infections and concomitant cardiovascular diseases. Methods: We performed a literature search for the terms calciphylaxis and calcific uremic arteriolopathy and summarized current state-of-the-art knowledge about pathophysiology, clinical picture, course of the disease, as well as treatment options. We have filled out the literature data with our personal treatment experiences. Results: A combination of various local and systemic risk factors are necessary to cause the development of calciphylaxis. This pathophysiological cascade is still incompletely understood. Patients with advanced CKD and dialysis patients are especially at risk to develop CUA. Regarding therapy, no randomized prospective trials are available, and treatment is rather based on pathophysiological considerations as well as on evidence derived from case reports or case series. Therapy focuses on optimized dialysis treatment, control of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder parameters, experimental anticalcification strategies and wound care. Conclusion: Facing the still deleterious outcome of patients with calciphylaxis, further studies on prophylaxis as well as treatment are urgently needed. Current treatment strategies may help ameliorate the course of the disease in some patients. However, it is still unclear if they are able to decrease mortality. © 2011 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.","Calcific uremic arteriolopathy; Calcification; Calciphylaxis; Chronic kidney disease; Vascular disease","anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; bisphosphonic acid derivative; cinacalcet; heparin; mineral; osteocalcin; sodium thiosulfate; steroid; vitamin K group; warfarin; artery calcification; article; bone disease; calcinosis; chronic kidney disease; clinical feature; dialysis; disease control; disease course; disease severity; human; hyperbaric oxygen; parathyroidectomy; pathophysiology; risk assessment; risk factor; surgical wound; wound care; Arterioles; Calcinosis; Calciphylaxis; Chelating Agents; Chronic Disease; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Skin; Thiosulfates","Brandenburg, V.

AION comprises arteritic AION (A-AION: due to giant cell arteritis) and non-arteritic AION (NA-AION: due to other causes). PION consists of arteritic PION (A-PION: due to giant cell arteritis), non-arteritic PION (NA-PION: due to other causes), and surgical PION (a complication of several systemic surgical procedures). These five types of ION are distinct clinical entities etiologically, pathogenetically, clinically and from the management point of view. In the management of AION, the first crucial step with patients aged 50 and over is to identify immediately whether it is arteritic or not because A-AION is an ophthalmic emergency and requires urgent treatment with high-dose steroid therapy to prevent any further visual loss in one or both eyes. Patients with NA-AION, when treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy within first 2 weeks of onset, had significantly better visual outcome than untreated ones. Systemic risk factors, particularly nocturnal arterial hypotension, play major roles in the development of NA-AION; management of them is essential in its prevention and management. NA-PION patients, when treated with high-dose systemic steroid therapy during the very early stages of the disease, showed significant improvement in visual acuity and visual fields, compared to untreated eyes. A-PION, like A-AION, requires urgent treatment with high-dose steroid therapy to prevent any further visual loss in one or both eyes.

To our knowledge there has been no previous examination of the relationship between kidney stones and subclinical atherosclerotic disease. We studied the relationship between nephrolithiasis, and carotid wall thickness and carotid stenosis assessed by B-mode ultrasound in the general community using data from the CARDIA study. Materials and Methods The CARDIA study is a United States, population based, observational study of 5,115 white and African-American men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 years at recruitment in 1985 to 1986. Results By the year 20 examination 200 (3.9%) CARDIA participants had reported ever having kidney stones. Symptomatic kidney stones were associated with greater carotid wall thickness measured at the year 20 examination, particularly of the internal carotid/bulb region. Using a composite dichotomous end point of carotid stenosis and/or the upper quartile of internal carotid/bulb wall thickness, the association of kidney stones with carotid atherosclerosis was significant (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.12.3, p = 0.01), even after adjusting for major atherosclerotic risk factors. Conclusions The association between a history of kidney stones and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in young adults adds further support to the notion that nephrolithiasis and atherosclerosis share common systemic risk factors and/or pathophysiology. © 2011 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.","atherosclerosis; urolithiasis","adolescent; adult; age; arterial wall thickness; article; carotid artery obstruction; carotid atherosclerosis; disease association; female; human; major clinical study; male; nephrolithiasis; observational study; priority journal; ultrasound; Adolescent; Adult; Atherosclerosis; Carotid Stenosis; Female; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Stoller, M.

To reduce the likelihood that credit derivatives will lead to future financial distress, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandates that many CDSs be traded through a centralized counterparty, a clearinghouse that acts as a seller to every buyer and a buyer to every seller. Proponents of central clearing argue that this reform minimizes risks to the financial system by reducing interconnections and dispersing losses. While the systemic benefits of central clearing are manifest, the downsides are less obvious: clearinghouses concentrate risk and pose enormous threats to financial stability should they fail. Ignoring such drawbacks, several members of Congress involved in Dodd-Frank negotiations, disturbed by the Federal Reserve's unprecedented market interventions, sought to revoke the central bank's authority to lend to clearinghouses. This Article argues that these imprudent efforts, though ultimately unsuccessful, could have prevented the Federal Reserve from staving off a catastrophic clearinghouse collapse. This Article asserts that clearinghouse access to central bank credit is crucial, particularly when central clearing of volatile CDSs is required.",,,"Kress, J. C.; Stephen M.

The general idea exhibited in this text is to introduce a common dependence of the LGD and the probability of default (PD) on a latent variable, representing the systemic risk. Though our theory can be applied to any arbitrary firm-value model and any underlying distribution for the LGD, provided its support is a compact subset of [0,1], special attention is given to the extension of the well-known cases of the Gaussian copula framework and the shifted Gamma one-factor model (a particular case of the generic one-factor Lvy model), and the LGD is modeled by a Beta distribution, in accordance with rating agency models and the Credit Metrics model. In order to introduce stochastic LGD, a monotonically decreasing relation is derived between the loss rate L, i.e. the loss as a percentage of the total exposure, and the standardized log-return R of the obligor's asset value, which is assumed to be a function of one or more systematic and idiosyncratic risk factors. The property that the relation is decreasing guarantees that the LGD is negatively correlated to R and hence positively correlated to the default rate. From this relation, expressions are then derived for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the expected value of the loss rate and the LGD, conditionally on a realization of the systematic risk factor(s). It is important to remark that all our results are derived under the large homogeneous portfolio (LHP) assumption and that they are fully consistent with the IRB approach outlined by the Basel II Capital Accord. We will demonstrate the impact of incorporating stochastic LGD and using models based on skew and fat-tailed distributions in determining adequate capital requirements. Furthermore, we also skim the potential application of the proposed framework in a credit risk environment. It will turn out that both building blocks, i.e. stochastic LGD and fat-tailed distributions, separately, increase the projected loss and thus the required capital charge. Hence, the aggregation of a model based on a fat-tailed underlying distribution that accounts for stochastic LGD will lead to sound capital requirements. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, as retinal vein occlusions (RVO) have a strong pathogenic correlation with the presence of hypertension or arteriosclerosis and the average age of affected patients is usually within the sixth or seventh decade of life, thrombophilia screening of RVO patients poses a particularly difficult diagnostic challenge. It is clear that to use medical resources appropriately and improve the level of interdisciplinary patient care in RVO, subgroup analysis is required. Just recently, some studies have demonstrated the significant role of coagulation disorders in specific subgroups of RVO patients and have provided recommendations for clinical practice. These results indicate that thrombophilic risk factors are significantly more prevalent among patients equal or less than 45 years of age at the time of RVO or a previous thromboembolic event, among patients with a remarkable family history of thromboembolism prior to the age of 45 years, or among patients without cardiovascular risk factors. According to these data, thrombophilia screening should be considered in these selected subgroups. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Cardiovascular risk factors; Factor XII deficiency; Resistance to APC; Retinal vein occlusion; Thrombophilia",,"Kuhli-Hattenbach, C.; Klinik für Augenheilkunde, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; email: kuhli@med.uni-frankfurt.de",,"Springer Verlag",2731720X,,OHTHE,"21287178","English; German","Ophthalmologe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951810404

Materials and Methods Repeat scans of 61 participants, acquired as part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Carotid MRI substudy, were digitally segmented using automated 3D level set methods, relying on an operator only to select the branch endpoints and thresholds for the 3D lumen surface initialization. Geometric factors characterizing the 3D lumen geometry were then extracted automatically. Results Of 122 scans, 117 could be segmented within 5 minutes each, with 40% being of sufficiently high quality to require less than 2 minutes each. Irrespective of scan quality, geometric factors were found to be highly reproducible, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) typically above 0.9. The reconstructed lumen surfaces were reproducible to <0.3 mm on average, comparable to previous MRI-based reproducibility studies. Owing to the automated nature of the analysis, operator reliability was near-perfect (ICC >0.99), with lumen surface differences <0.1 mm. Conclusion The 3D geometry of the carotid bifurcation can be characterized rapidly and with a high degree of consistency, even for suboptimal image qualities. This bodes well for large-scale retrospective or prospective studies aimed at teasing out the influence of local vs. systemic risk factors for early atherosclerosis.

However, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can control C5aR activation by generating C5a through its own C5 convertase-like enzymatic activity. In this paper, we show that P. gingivalis uses this mechanism to proactively and selectively inhibit TLR2-induced IL-12p70, whereas the same pathogen-instigated C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk upregulates other inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). In vivo, the ability of P. gingivalis to manipulate TLR2 activation via the C5a-C5aR axis allowed it to escape IL-12p70-dependent immune clearance and to cause inflammatory bone loss in a murine model of experimental periodontitis. In the latter regard, C5aR-deficient or TLR2-deficient mice were both resistant to periodontal bone loss, in stark contrast with wild-type control mice, which is consistent with the interdependent interactions of C5aR and TLR2 in P. gingivalis immune evasion and induction of bone-resorptive cytokines. In conclusion, P. gingivalis targets C5aR to promote its adaptive fitness and cause periodontal disease. Given the current availability of safe and effective C5aR antagonists, pharmacological blockade of C5aR could act therapeutically in human periodontitis and reduce associated systemic risks.

Moreover, it also suggests rediscovering and situating the socio-economic function of finance (and financing) in the economy and society. To complement this approach, we recall the European acceptance of “paying differences” since late nineteenth century. Derivative assets were traded in Europe, but the underlying assets (stocks and bonds) on which derivatives are built were authorized beforehand. Marteau and Morand (2010) recently appealed for reintroducing an a priori authorization procedure before new derivative assets can be marketed: this view thus inherits a century-long tradition. Eventually, it seems that a priori authorization allows for administration of systemic risk while common law-inherited rejection of disagreement-based speculation is a strong foundation for both supervisory and legal (a posteriori) decisions. © 2011 Convivium.

Regional consensus is now supporting economic rebalancing away from the dominant focus on exports to developed markets toward more and more balanced economic structure supported by domestic and regional financial development. In relation to finance, the crisis highlights the neces-sity of addressing a range of issues across the region. First, Asian approaches to financial liberalization, prudential regulation, and financial innovation are likely to be closely considered around the world. At the same time, while the region has not been at the center of the global crisis—in contrast to the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98—it nonetheless provides an important opportunity to strengthen domestic and regional financial regulations. Second, beyond the postcrisis issues, and the prevention of systemic risk in particular, finance must continue to play a central role in supporting economic development and poverty reduction across the region. While the global crisis has highlighted once again the risks of finance, a central objective, across Asia, must be financial sector development to support economic growth and development. Third, in addition to domestic reform, the crisis provides an opportunity to enhance the international financial architecture, not only to improve its efficacy, but also to enhance the role of empowered Asian economies in global fora and institutions. At the same time, weaknesses in the international financial architecture suggest the need for Asian regional alternatives to address liquidity, liberalization, regulation, and exchange rate volatility. © 2009, SAGE Publications Ltd.","financial sector development; Global financial crisis; Group of 20; systemic risk",,,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",09749101,,,,"English","Global J.

This gave rise to concerns and calls for the private equity industry to be regulated. The financial crisis, and in particular the contraction of the market for debt prompted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, has led to a significant reduction in the number and value of private equity deals. However, if anything, the financial crisis has led to increased calls for regulation of the industry. This paper examines the development of private equity transactions in Europe, and analyses the nature of these transactions. It then considers whether the concerns raised in relation to private equity are justified. Broadly, the arguments in favour of regulation of private equity may be divided into two kinds: the need to increase transparency in the industry by imposing disclosure obligations, and systemic risk concerns. These arguments are considered, and the terms of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) are examined in the light of these issues. It is argued that the arguments in favour of regulation of private equity are weaker than has been suggested and that this Directive does not adequately differentiate between hedge funds and private equity when imposing this regulatory regime. © 2011, T.M.C.

Lessons from the Past Financial crises are not new. As early as 1792, during the presidency of George Washington, the nation suffered a severe panic that froze credit and nearly brought the young economy to its knees. Over the next 140 years, financial crises struck on a regular basis-in 1797, 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893-96, 1907, and 1929-33-roughly every fifteen to twenty years. But as the United States emerged from the Great Depression, something remarkable happened: the crises stopped. New financial regulation-including federal deposit insurance, securities regulation, and banking supervision-effectively protected the system from devastating outbreaks. Economic growth returned, but recurrent financial crises did not. In time, a financial crisis was seen as a ghost of the past. After fifty years without a financial crisis-the longest such stretch in the nation's history- financial firms and policy makers began to see regulation as a barrier to efficient functioning of the capital markets rather than a necessary precondition for success. This change in attitude had unfortunate consequences. As financial markets grew and globalized, often with breathtaking speed, the U.S. regulatory system could have benefited from smart changes. But deregulation and the growth of unregulated, parallel shadow markets were accompanied by the nearly unrestricted marketing of increasingly complex consumer financial products that multiplied risk at every stratum of the economy, from the family level to the global level. The result proved disastrous. The first warning followed deregulation of the thrifts, when the country suffered the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. A second warning came in 1998 when a crisis was only narrowly averted following the failure of a large unregulated hedge fund. The near financial panic of 2002, brought on by corporate accounting and governance failures, sounded a third warning. The United States now faces its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. It is critical that the lessons of that crisis be studied to restore a proper balance between free markets and the regulatory framework necessary to ensure the operation of those markets to protect the economy, honest market participants, and the public. 2. Shortcomings of the Present The current crisis should come as no surprise. The present regulatory system has failed to effectively manage risk, require sufficient transparency, and ensure fair dealings. Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to extremes. The government has a critical role to play in helping to manage both public and private risk. Without clear and effective rules in place, productive financial activity can degenerate into unproductive gambling, while sophisticated financial transactions, as well as more ordinary consumer credit transactions, can give way to swindles and fraud. A well-regulated financial system serves a key public purpose: if it has the power and if its leaders have the will to use that power, it channels savings and investment into productive economic activity and helps prevent financial contagion. Like the management of any complex hazard, financial regulation should not rely on a single magic bullet, but instead should employ an array of related measures for managing various elements of risk. The advent of the automobile brought enormous benefits but also considerable risks to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The solution was not to prohibit driving, but rather to manage the risks through reasonable speed limits, better road construction, safer sidewalks, required safety devices (seatbelts, airbags, children's car seats, antilock breaks), mandatory automobile insurance, and so on. The same holds true in the financial sector. In recent years, however, the regulatory system not only failed to manage risk, it also failed to require disclosure of risk through sufficient transparency. American financial markets are profoundly dependent upon transparency. After all, the fundamental risk/reward corollary depends on the ability of market participants to have confidence in their ability to accurately judge risk. Markets have become opaque in multiple ways. Some markets, such as hedge funds and credit default swaps, provide virtually no information. Even so, disclosure alone does not always provide genuine transparency. Market participants must have useful, relevant information delivered in an appropriate, timely manner. Recent market occurrences involving off-balance-sheet entities and complex financial instruments reveal the lack of transparency resulting from the wrong information disclosed at the wrong time and in the wrong manner. Mortgage documentation suffers from a similar problem, with reams of paper thrust at borrowers at closing, far too late for any borrower to make a well-informed decision. Just as markets and financial products evolve, so too must efforts to provide understanding through genuine transparency. To compound the problem associated with uncontained and opaque risks, the current regulatory framework has failed to ensure fair dealings. Unfair dealing can be blatant, such as outright deception or fraud, but unfairness can also be much more subtle, as when parties are unfairly matched. Individuals have limited time and expertise to master complex financial dealings. If one party to a transaction has significantly more resources, time, sophistication or experience, other parties are at a fundamental disadvantage. The regulatory system should take appropriate steps to level the playing field. Unfair dealings affect not only the specific transaction participants, but extend across entire markets, neighborhoods, socioeconomic groups, and whole industries. Even when only a limited number of families in one neighborhood have been the direct victims of a predatory lender, the entire neighborhood and even the larger community will suffer very real consequences from the resulting foreclosures. As those consequences spread, the entire financial system can be affected as well. More importantly, unfairness, or even the perception of unfairness, causes a loss of confidence in the marketplace. It becomes all the more critical for regulators to ensure fairness through meaningful disclosure, consumer protection measures, stronger enforcement, and other measures. Fair dealings provide credibility to businesses and satisfaction to consumers. In tailoring regulatory responses to these and other problems, the goal should always be to strike a reasonable balance between the costs of regulation and its benefits. Just as speed limits are more stringent on busy city streets than on open highways, financial regulation should be strictest where the threats.especially the threats to other citizens.are greatest, and it should be more moderate elsewhere. 3. Recommendations for the Future Modern financial regulation can provide consumers and investors with adequate information for making sound financial decisions and can protect them from being misled or defrauded, especially in complex financial transactions. Better regulation can reduce conflicts of interest and help manage moral hazard, particularly by limiting incentives for excessive risk taking stemming from often implicit government guaranties. By limiting risk taking in key parts of the financial sector, regulation can reduce systemic threats to the broader financial system and the economy as a whole. Ultimately, financial regulation embodies good risk management, transparency, and fairness. Had regulators given adequate attention to even one of the three key areas of risk management, transparency and fairness, we might have averted the worst aspects of the current crisis. 1. Risk management should have been addressed through better oversight of systemic risks. If companies that are now deemed ""too big to fail"" had been better regulated, either to diminish their systemic impact or to curtail the risks they took, then these companies could have been allowed to fail or to reorganize without taxpayer bailouts. The creation of any new implicit government guarantee of high-risk business activities could have been avoided. 2. Transparency should have been addressed though better, more accurate credit ratings. If companies issuing high-risk credit instruments had not been able to obtain AAA ratings from the private credit rating agencies, then pension funds, financial institutions, state and local municipalities, and others that relied on those ratings would not have been misled into making dangerous investments. 3. Fairness should have been addressed though better regulation of consumer financial products. If the excesses in mortgage lending had been curbed by even the most minimal consumer protection laws, the loans that were fed into the mortgage backed securities would have been choked off at the source, and there would have been no ""toxic assets"" to threaten the global economy. While the current crisis had many causes, it was not unforeseeable. Correcting the mistakes that fueled this crisis is within reach. The challenge now is to develop a new set of rules for a new financial system. The Panel has identified eight specific areas most urgently in need of reform: 1. Identify and regulate financial institutions that pose systemic risk. 2. Limit excessive leverage in American financial institutions. 3. Increase supervision of the shadow financial system. 4. Create a new system for federal and state regulation of mortgages and other consumer credit products. 5. Create executive pay structures that discourage excessive risk taking. 6. Reform the credit rating system. 7. Make establishing a global financial regulatory floor a U.S. diplomatic priority. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Regulatory and Treasury Department initiatives include (1) a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposal to give shareholders meeting certain standards the right to place their board nominees on a company's proxy card; (2) Treasury Department legislative proposals that would respectively (a) give the SEC power to ensure that companies' compensation committees have greater independence in setting executive pay; and (b) give shareholders the right to a non-binding vote on executive pay called ""say on pay."" Among legislative initiatives, S. 1074(Schumer) would (1) allow shareholders with a certain amount of company stock to use a company's proxy (annual meeting shareholder communication) machinery to nominate directors; (2) require companies to create a corporate board committee on risk; (3) require companies to hold annual director elections; and (4) require that board chairs be independent directors (and not the CEO as is the common practice). Among other things, H.R. 3269(Frank), which passed the U.S. House on July 31, 2009, applies to certain financial firms and would (1) require the disclosure of incentive-based pay arrangements to federal regulators for the purpose of determining whether they are aligned with sound risk management; (2) authorize federal regulators to prohibit incentive structures that are seen to encourage inappropriate risk-taking; and (3) require them to adopt say on pay. Despite their differences, several of the new executive pay and corporate governance initiatives require say on pay by publicly traded firms. TARP recipients are already subject to such regulations. Particularly for financial firms, say on pay's proponents argue that current forms of compensation often lead to excessive risk taking, potential systemic risk, and the improper alignment of interests between company stakeholders. They also claim that the pay consultants who advise compensation committees on executive pay often have conflicts of interest that lead to a pro-management bias. In addition, say on pay's proponents cite evidence that the adoption of say on pay in the United Kingdom in 2002 appears to have led to better communication between companies and shareholders. Critics of say on pay argue that the reform would adversely affect the traditional relationship between directors, management and shareholders, and the largely state-based corporate regulatory regime, which are said to have generally served our economy well. Critics have also raised other concerns over the ability of shareholders to understand the complexities of executive pay, and the increased costs, including the loss of top talent, that corporations might incur if say on pay were adopted. The detractors also cite developments such as the reductions in the average tenure of chief executive officers (CEOs) as an indication that boards are becoming less pro-management, greatly reducing the need for governance reforms such as say on pay. Critics have additional concerns that activist shareholders would improperly use leverage gained from adoption of say on pay to help attain certain parochial goals such as unionization, which they argue may not be in the best interests of the firm.

A number of analysts have noted how risk management is a central preoccupation of businesses of all kinds, orienting both their internal activities and their external relations with their “stakeholders.” Indeed to the extent that the phenomenal growth of derivatives and credit default swap (CDS) trading is argued to have been one contributory factor in the global financial crisis of 2007–2009 (GFC), these financial products were sold to so-called “end user” businesses (airlines, commodities producers, etc.) as a risk mitigation strategy. As many have pointed out since the advent of the GFC, the financial services firms who packaged and sold these products appeared less adept at engaging in their own internal risk mitigation processes. Meanwhile “risk-based regulation” has increasingly captured the imagination of regulators, whether because of directives from politicians – as in the UK – as a response to resource shortages, or because it became synonymous with “smart regulation.” A number of commentators have observed that structuring regulatory activities in terms of a hierarchy of risk requires a different stance from a more traditional regulatory preoccupation with uniform adherence to legal norms. Despite its increasing popularity as a form of meta-regulation, Black and Baldwin point out that the risk-based regulation operationalized by the Financial Services Authority in the UK took part of the blame for a regulatory failure to protect the public during the GFC. The attempt to identify which institutions and activities posed the most risk to the regulatory system with a view to concentrating regulatory effort there does not appear to have worked particularly well in the UK. Despite the lack of a ringing endorsement for contemporary practices of risk-based regulation, the discourse of “systemic risk” has nonetheless emerged as central to the activities of policy-makers and politicians globally in the wake of the financial crisis. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,"Condon, M.; Osgoode Hall Law School, York UniversityCanada",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511794537; 9781107006010,,,"English","The Embedded Firm: Corporate Gov., Labor, and Finance Capitalism",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927000563

In reflecting on the revised paper some time on from the seminar, at a time when economic growth seems ever more elusive, then any recipe that law reform can provide to promote it, is worthy of re-examination. McCormack’s discussion of the orthodoxy that drives World Bank and UNCITRAL efforts in this area, deriving its intellectual force from the work of La Porta et al., provides a useful reminder of the faith in strong private property rights, including the ability to grant enforceable security interests therein, as being a key driver of access to credit on the most efficient terms for firms and households, the engines of growth, and that increasing the supply of credit is in itself a public good. The point might also have been made here that, in light of the role of excess leverage in contributing to the build-up of systemic risk in the banking sector that led to the financial crisis of 2008 that any claim to offer cheap and widely available credit as a public good is open to attack. Albeit the ability to create security interests in property was in itself by no means a central villain of the piece in the banking crisis of 2008, with many other factors such as the tax privileging of debt, weak and wrongly targeted regulation and the explosive growth of securitization instruments and markets playing their part, an ‘underwater’ homeowner facing foreclosure on her home from a lender and whose consumption and investment decisions are, in consequence, the antithesis of growth promoting, may feel somewhat differently about the virtues of strong form, lender protective and easily enforceable security interests. Especially when many of those very same lenders have seen the benefit of bail-outs, assistance and forbearance that their borrowers can only dream of. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,,"Gray, J.; Newcastle University Law SchoolUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139226363; 9781107027442,,,"English","Availab. of Credit and Secured Transactions in a Time of Crisis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923505731

After having briefly examined the pros and the cons of directly regulating these investment schemes, it comes to the conclusion (largely shared by most scholars) that hedge funds should not be directly regulated, while regulation should concern their management companies and, most of all, their counterparts (lenders in the first place) with a view to managing systemic risk. In addition, regulation should also set precise thresholds for access which should aim at protecting unsophisticated investors from hazardous moves, without, however, falling into the trap of regulating hedge fund themselves. The attention is then turned to the European Union and to its Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). An analysis is conducted on some of the most significant approaches to hedge fund regulation which have fuelled (and are partly still fuelling) the debate within EU institutions in its struggle to provide Member States with a valid response to the financial crisis, and on some key provisions of the first level AIFMD. In this light the author concludes that, despite the declared intent to regulated fund managers, the directive often seems to regulate hedge fund themselves. This does not seem to be in line with the thoughts of most scholars and market operators on hedge fund regulation and also looks at odds with other pieces of EU legislation (in particular with the so-called ""Newcits"").",,,"Dardanelli, G.T.; Banking and Financial Regulation, , Milan, Italy",,"Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH",1867299X,,,,"English","Eur.

There are many systemic risk factors that are related to the appearance and development of atherosclerosis. It has been observed, however, that the lesions occur in specific regions of the arterial tree. Nowadays it is accepted that these regions are the ones with low abnormal values of Wall Shear Stress (WSS). The aim of this work is to generate a platform to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from an LCA, generate a finite element mesh and run a patient specific blood flow simulation in it. The 3D model of the LCA reconstructed was based on a computed tomography (CT) study from a healthy patient. The method used for this procedure consisted basically on three stages: (1) segmenting the LCA principal branches from TC images, (2) extracting several contours from the arteries so as to get the essence of the geometry, applying a self-developed software, and (3) using this outlines to generate a Non-uniform rotational basis spline (NURBS surface). A finite element unstructured volume mesh was generated and refined and a simulation was run on it using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) application. The values of pressure and velocity were analyzed and WSS was computed. As expected, regions of low WSS were found in the outer walls of the bifurcation and in the inner wall of curvatures.",,"Biomedical engineering; Blood vessels; Computational fluid dynamics; Computerized tomography; Finite element method; Hemodynamics; Life cycle; Mesh generation; Shear stress; Atherosclerotic plaque; Blood flow simulations; Coronary arteries; Finite element mesh generations; Finite element meshes; Left coronary arteries; Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction; Wall shear stress; Three dimensional computer graphics","Salles, S.; Universidad Favaloro, Av Belgrano 1723, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina; email: sabinasalles@gmail.com",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17426588,,,,"English","J.

In this viewpoint, we reemphasise that understanding the systemic nature of social and ecological interactions and interdependencies is fundamental to developing resilience to shocks and stresses in whatever context they materialise. Through the lens of the 2011 Japanese multi-disaster, we reflect on some of the difficulties in generating knowledge to underpin resilience-building processes and illustrate some dilemmas inherent in seeking to cultivate resilience in practice. Events in Japan underscore the complex vulnerabilities of place in multi-hazard scenarios and highlight, in particular, the choices to be made in determining which systemic interactions are to be imagined, characterised, assessed and forewarned and which are not. These events also emphasise that while resilience ultimately must be located where consequences are felt, strategies for a resilient future have to take on the multi-scale interactions and tensions within which local processes are embedded. There are dangers, we argue, in thinking about resilience in overly simple and non-systemic ways and in responding to these challenges only as a matter of extended techno-managerial competence. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Governance; Multi-hazard; Risk management; Systemic risks; Vulnerability","disaster management; governance approach; risk assessment; strategic approach; vulnerability; Japan","Tweed, F.; Department of Geography, , Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom; email: f.s.tweed@staffs.ac.uk",,"Routledge",13549839,,,,"English","Local Environ.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855726966

The governing boards of many financial-services firms seemed unable to prevent the risky and ill-fated decisions that jeopardized their firms, devastated their investors, and helped precipitate a financial meltdown that morphed into global recession. Company boards were also directly responsible through their compensation committees and consultant advisors for a sharp rise in executive compensation during the 2000s that may have contributed to undue short-term risk-taking among the financial-service companies that helped spark the recession. The macroeconomic environment also changed. Historically low interest rates, and the development of new ways of financing mortgage products led to an irrationally exuberant mind-set of lending and borrowing in the housing market. The quality of some loans was questionable, but home asset prices continued to increase - until they collapsed in 2008. The boom and bust in the housing market was an important contributor - one of many including inadequate corporate governance - to the perfect financial storm of 2008-09. From a conference with 87 papers on the role of corporate governance in precipitating or exacerbating the financial crisis, and from five articles by governance researchers and three articles by prominent governance participant-observers included in this special issue, it is evident that governance played a contributing role. An article by Muller-Kahle and Lewellyn finds that directors of sub-prime lenders compared with other lenders served on a larger number of other company boards, presumably allowing then less time to monitor the sub-prime lender's risky practices, and they served for fewer years on the sub-prime lender's board, suggesting that they were less experienced in evaluating the financial risks of the sub-prime markets. A second article by Grove, Patelli, Victoravich, and Xu report that the higher the levels of debt held by banks, a policy presumably monitored and approved by directors, the lower bank financial and operating performance during the financial crisis. A third article by Yeh, Liu, and Chung finds that director independence on the auditing and risk management committees affected risk taking behaviors and subsequent performance. In the pursuit of productive avenues for reform, a fourth article Pirson and Turnbull argue for a network of boards representing multiple constituencies, convened through a ""stakeholder congress,"" that would bring more sources of information to the attention of more actors who could make more effective use of the information in guiding company risk management. A fifth article by Nicholson, Kiel, and Kiel-Chisholm argue for the re-establishment of professional restraints and creation of a new set of more responsible social norms within the financial sector to avoid the next financial meltdown. Three well-informed participant observers corroborate these findings and direct special attention to both company and country governance issues at they help foster the financial meltdown. Berglöf finds that the absence of both micro and macro protections against excessive and systemic risk may have opened the way for the perfect storm. Feinberg concludes that distortions from economically-rational pay practices - ultimately the responsibility of the board - may have contributed to the financial crisis as executives sought to optimize their pay in ways that were not optimal for the firm nor its investors, customers, or lenders. Johnson places some of the blame for the crisis indirectly on the governance door step - directors who hired and monitored the bankers at center of the crisis had helped foster a culture of short-term greed and narrow self-interest that became toxic when it became systemic and no longer limited to a few aberrant players. Taken together, the five articles and three commentaries in this issue point to the importance and interplay of both micro and macro governance factors in contributing to the financial crisis of 2008-09 - and to the importance of reforming those factors to help avert another financial crisis in the future. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,"Useem, M.; Michael Useem Department of Management, , Philadelphia, PA, 19104-6370, United States",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09648410,,,,"English","Corp.

The window of opportunity to put in place fully fledged macroprudential frameworks should not be missed. Meeting this challenge calls for a finely balanced blend of boldness and realism. Boldness is required to face the hard design questions head-on; realism to avoid overreach and to manage expectations. Policymakers should be as ambitious as possible, but no more. In all this, research has an important role to play in allowing the framework to grow at a pace commensurate with our knowledge. This speech considers how to strike the balance between boldness and realism in several aspects of the framework: in the criterion for judging its success; in how closely systemic risk should be tracked; in the mix between an aggregate and a sectoral approach; in that between rules and discretion; and in governance arrangements.

Index insurance avoids many of the problems that have plagued conventional insurance. Because the insured cannot significantly influence the value of the index, and thus the indemnity paid by the contract, index insurance is essentially free of moral hazard. The potential benefits of index insurance ultimately depend on the correlation between the indemnities it provides and the losses suffered by the insured the greater the correlation, the greater the potential benefit. The ability of MFIs to expand their services to the large number of rural poor whose livelihoods depend on agriculture has been impeded by the incidence of large systemic risks such as droughts, floods, and other weather-related events that render portfolios of agricultural loans many times riskier than portfolios of urban business loans.",,"agricultural finance; conference proceeding; developing world; financial market; insurance system; optimization; risk assessment; rural economy; rural finance","Miranda, M.J.; Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics, , Columbus, OH, United States",,,00029092,,,,"English","Am.

Apart from its place of origin in United States, more similarities can be tracked down. Both started in financial markets turbulence with its repercussions in decline in industrial production as well as world trade. Existing studies identify several categories of different causes that might have contributed to financial and subsequently economic crisis and its spread around the world. Short term explications point mainly to loose monetary policy, which kept interest rates lower than would have corresponded to real economic situation. In combination with revised Community Reinvestment Act, which enabled even lower-income population groups to invest into real estates, this was a start-up for real estate bubble and consequent problems of many financial institutions once this bubble burst out. However, long term factors of more fundamental nature should not be overlooked. Insufficient and/or rather missing regulations of financial markets at which financial instruments of different kinds evolved during previous period bear its soured fruit. Nontransparent operations of investment bank reinforced with positive ratings of rating agencies, excessive securitization as well as underestimation of systemic risk led to moral hazard with its ramifications in bankruptcies of many financial institutions. Some experts claim that savings-investment imbalance across the world together with increasing oil prices, as well as prices of other raw materials and food have played its role in escalation of the whole problem too. Indubitably, all analysed factors have had its more or less significant impact on current economic situation. Ensuing measures taken by governments and central banks to mitigate crisis impact on national economies together with state budgets current condition as well as spillover effects of such measures are to be discussed in more detail in following research.","Economic crisis; Financial market regulations; Fiscal policy; Interest rates; Monetary policy; Subprime mortgages",,"Lungová, M.; Technická univerzita v Liberci, Czech Republic; email: miroslava.lungova@tul.cz",,"Technical University of Liberec",12123609,,,,"Czech","E M Ekon.

RPE-derived matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-14, and basigin (BSG) are major enzymes involved in the maintenance of ECM turnover. Hypertension (HTN) is a systemic risk factor for AMD. It has previously been reported that angiotensin II (Ang II), one of the most important hormones associated with HTN, increases MMP-2 activity and its key regulator, MMP-14, in RPE, inducing breakdown of the RPE basement membrane, which may lead to progression of sub-RPE deposits. Ang II exerts most of its actions by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Herein is explored the MAPK signaling pathway as a potential key intracellular modulator of Ang II-induced increase in MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and BSG protein expression. It was observed that Ang II stimulates phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK in RPE cells and ERK/p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in mice. These effects were mediated by Ang II type 1 receptors. Blockade of ERK or p38 MAPK abrogated the increase in MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and BSG proteins in ARPE-19 cells. A better understanding of the molecular events by which Ang II induces ECM dysregulation is of critical importance to further define its contribution to the progression of sub-RPE deposits in AMD patients with HTN.

This article aims to explain the divergence between societal debate and biosafety legislation and presents approaches to bring both together. Main features: The article reviews the development of biosafety regulations in the USA and the EU, focussing on diverging concepts applied for assessing the risks of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Results: The dominant environmental risk assessment methodology has been developed to answer basic questions to enable expedient decision making. As a first step, methodologies that take into account complex environmental and landscape aspects should be applied. Expanding the scope of risk assessment, more holistic concepts have been developed, for example the Organisation for Econonomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concept of systemic risks which includes socio-economic aspects. International bodies as the OECD, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the European Union (EU) have developed the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as an instrument that includes the additional aspects of risk assessment as demanded by many stakeholders. Interestingly, there had been no attempts yet to link the existing frameworks of GMO risk assessment and SEA. Conclusions: It is recommended to adapt current models of SEA to assess the systemic risks of GMOs. It is also suggested to revise the EU GMO legislation to promote the inclusion of SEA elements. © 2011 Meyer; licensee Springer.",,,"Meyer, H.; Federation of German Scientists, In den Steinäckern 13, Braunschweig, 38116, Germany; email: hmeyer@ensser.org",,"Springer Verlag",21904707,,,,"English","Env.

Several mechanisms may associate tooth loss and related oral inflammation with cognitive impairment. The authors studied the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive function. Methods. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study is a national longitudinal study of more than 30,000 African American and white adults 45 years or older. Data for tooth loss, cognitive function and potential confounding variables were available for 9,853 participants at the time of analysis. The authors used incremental linear regression modeling to investigate the crosssectional association between self-reported tooth loss and cognitive function. Results. In unadjusted analysis (mean learning followed by recall; a level of significance of .05), the loss of six to 16 teeth and the loss of more than 16 teeth were associated with poorer cognitive function compared with the loss of no teeth. Attenuated associations persisted after the authors adjusted for demographic and systemic risk factors. The full model, which was adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES), revealed no association between tooth loss and cognitive function. Conclusion. Tooth loss may be associated with cognitive function; however, this association is mediated by age and SES. Clinical Implications. Tooth loss due to periodontal disease may be a marker for low SES, and the interplay of these factors with advanced age may confer risk of having poorer cognitive function. Further studies are needed to clarify these associations.","Cognitive function; Tooth loss",,"Matthews, J.

Using the Economatica and CVM databases, this study focuses on 145 companies in the period 1998-2007. We find that Brazilian smoothers have a smaller degree of systemic risk than non-smoothers. In average terms, the beta of smoothers is significantly lower than non-smoothers. Regarding return, we find that the abnormal annualized returns of smoothers are significantly higher. We confirm differences in the groups by nonparametric and parametric tests in cross section or as time series, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference in performance in the Brazilian market between firms that do and do not engage in smoothing. © 2011 Brazilian Administration Review.

We conclude that, while systemic risk remains lower in insurance than in the banking sector, it is not negligible and has grown in recent years, partly as a consequence of insurers increasing links with banks and their recent focus on non-(traditional) insurance activities, including structured finance. We conclude by considering the structural changes in the insurance industry that are likely to result from the crisis, including possible effects on bancassurance activity, and offer some thoughts on changes in the regulation of insurance markets that might ensue. © 2011 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.","credit risk; financial crisis; Insurance; systemic risk",,"Baluch, F.; Commerzbank, , London EC3V OHR, United Kingdom",,,10185895,,,,"English","Geneva Pap. on Risk Insur.

Alan Greenspan's retrospective indicates what he has learned from the crisis. He argues that the crisis, the housing price bubble, was unpredictable and unavoidable. Greenspan now focuses on desirable capital requirements, or leverage, for banks and financial intermediaries. I explain why the Fed's and Greenspan's views stem from a lack of the appropriate tools of analysis of what is an excessive debt or leverage. The Quants who devised the highly leveraged financial derivatives ignored systemic risk.My theme is that the application of stochastic optimal control (SOC) is an effective approach to implement what the D-F bill is authorizing. I explain: first, what is the optimal capital requirement/leverage that balances expected return against risk. Second, what is a theoretically derived early warning signal of a crisis. Third, I derive an excess debt ratio, equal to the difference between the actual and optimal ratios. The probability of a debt crisis is directly related to the excess debt ratio. The excess debt ratio starting from 2004-05 indicated that a crisis was most likely. The Fed should use this SOC analysis in implementing the Dodd-Frank bill. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Bubbles; Capital requirements; Dodd-Frank bill; Dodd-Frank reform bill; Greenspan; Optimal leverage and debt ratios; Stochastic optimal control; Warning signals of crisis",,"Stein, J.L.; Division Applied Mathematics, , RI 02912, United States; email: Jerome_Stein@Brown.edu",,,02649993,,,,"English","Econ.

The results indicate very little downside risk in East Asia. Third, East Asian and Latin American returns exhibit some correlation complexity. Interestingly, the regions with maximal dependence or worst diversification do not command large returns. Our results suggest international limits to diversification.

Methodology/approach - To test this hypothesis, the chapter uses the residuals of the trend relationship among housing wealth and labor income to predict both stock returns and government bond yields. Specifically, it shows that nonlinear deviations of housing wealth from its cointegrating relationship with labor income, hwy, forecast expected future returns. Findings - Using data for a set of industrialized countries, the chapter finds that when the housing wealth-to-income ratio falls, investors demand a higher risk premium for stocks. As for government bond returns: (i) when they are seen as a component of asset wealth, investors react in the same manner and (ii) if, however, investors perceive the increase in government bond returns as signaling a future rise in taxes or a deterioration of public finances, then they interpret the fall in the housing wealth-to-income ratio as a fall in future bond premia. Finally, this work shows that the occurrence of crisis episodes amplifies the transmission of housing market shocks to financial markets. Originality/value of chapter - These findings are novel. They also open new and challenging avenues for understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the housing sector, stock market and government bond developments, and the banking system.

Although the industrialized economies have stopped contracting, for many, unemployment is still rising. The United States likely hit bottom in June 2009, but numerous small banks and households still face huge problems in restoring their balance sheets, and unemployment has combined with sub-prime loans to keep home foreclosures at a high rate. Nearly all industrialized countries and many emerging and developing nations avoided dropping into another ""Great Depression"" by implementing sizable economic stimulus and/or financial sector rescue packages, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5). Several countries have resorted to borrowing from the International Monetary Fund as a last resort. The crisis has exposed fundamental weaknesses in financial systems worldwide, demonstrated how interconnected and interdependent economies are today, and has posed vexing policy dilemmas. The process for coping with the crisis by countries across the globe has been manifest in four basic phases. The first has been intervention to contain the contagion and restore confidence in the system. The second has been coping with the secondary effects of the crisis, particularly the global recession and flight of capital from countries in emerging markets and elsewhere that have been affected by the crisis. The third phase of this process is to make changes in the financial system to reduce risk and prevent future crises. In order to give these proposals political backing, world leaders have called for international meetings to address changes in policy, regulations, oversight, and enforcement. On September 24-25, 2009, heads of the G-20 nations met in Pittsburgh to address the global financial crisis. The fourth phase of the process is dealing with political, social, and security effects of the financial turmoil. One such effect is the strengthened role of China in financial markets. The role for Congress in this financial crisis is multifaceted.

Congress, as a result, is left with the question of how best to handle the failure of systemically significant financial companies (SSFCs). In the United States, the insolvencies of depository institutions (i.e., banks and thrifts with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)) are not handled according to the procedures of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, they and their subsidiaries are subject to a separate regime prescribed in federal law, called a conservatorship or receivership. Under this regime, the conservator or receiver, which generally is the FDIC, is provided substantial authority to deal with virtually every aspect of the insolvency. However, the failure of most other financial institutions within bank, thrift, and financial holding company umbrellas (including the holding companies themselves) generally are dealt with under the Bankruptcy Code.In March of 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner proposed legislation that would impose a conservatorship/receivership regime, much like that for depository institutions, on insolvent financial institutions that are deemed systemically significant. In order to make a policy assessment concerning the appropriateness of this proposal, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences between insured depositories and other financial institutions large enough or interconnected enough to pose systemic risk to the U.S. economy upon failure, as well as the differences between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority.This chapter first discusses the purposes behind the creation of a separate insolvency regime for depository institutions. The report then compares and contrasts the characteristics of depository institutions with SSFCs. Next, the report provides a brief analysis of some important differences between the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority and that of the Bankruptcy Code. The specific differences discussed are: (1) overall objectives of each regime; (2) insolvency initiation authority and timing; (3) oversight structure and appeal; (4) management, shareholder, and creditor rights; (5) FDIC -superpowers,"" including contract repudiation versus Bankruptcy's automatic stay; and (6) speed of resolution. This chapter makes no value judgment as to whether an insolvency regime for SSFCs that is modeled after the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority is more appropriate than using (or adapting) the Bankruptcy Code. Rather, it simply points out the similarities and differences between SSFCs and depository institutions, and compares the conservatorship/receivership insolvency regime with the Bankruptcy Code to help the reader develop his/her own opinion. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This requires primarily the modelling of the interactions of structures and dynamics in complex networks that, in turn, strongly encourages a cross-disciplinary fertilization in order to apply models already accepted in other fields and whose impact on real-world problems have been evaluated. In fact, there is a lack of data adequately describing economic networks, nowadays built on intricate interdependencies, trade relations and supply chains on a worldwide scale.

These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to our results, real long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Asset Price Booms and Busts; Discrete-Choice Model; Early Warning Indicators; Leaning Against the Wind Policies; Macro-prudential Regulation",,"Direction Générale des Etudes et des Relations Internationales, 39 rue Croix des Petits Champs, 75049 Paris Cedex 01, France",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,9783642153396,,,"English","Hous.

To help improve public safety and emergency preparedness, it is important to have a methodology to evaluate and quantify the seismic risk and vulnerability of the existing bridge systems. Due to the large number of bridges in existing infrastructure inventories and the limitation of resources available, there is a need to prioritize which bridges should be selected to undergo structural assessments by detailed analysis and possible rehabilitations. The current practice, based on physical site inspections and assessment by computer structural analysis, does not give high level assessment information on the risk and vulnerability of the entire bridge infrastructure from a system perspective. A probabilistic performance-based approach has been developed to assess the systemic risk and vulnerabilities of bridges in a city, regional or national network. This framework involves four interim steps of site hazard analysis, structural response analysis, damage analysis and estimation of economic loss. In this framework, the calculated responses of the evaluated facility subject to the seismic hazard at a site are linked to the probability of damage occurrence by using fragility curves. The expected economic losses are then evaluated at estimated damage levels. Utilizing available bridge performance databases the probabilistic seismic risk assessment methodology can be applied to inventories of bridges. This paper presents a pilot study of a sampled database of bridges in the City of Ottawa in Canada to show how this approach can be implemented to obtain seismic risk and vulnerability information of existing bridges from a system perspective. The system performance information will help with better decision making on resource allocation for bridge infrastructure maintenance and management.",,"Bridge infrastructure; Bridge performance; Damage analysis; Damage level; Economic loss; Emergency preparedness; Existing bridge; Fragility curves; Hazard analysis; Pilot studies; Public safety; Seismic deficiencies; Seismic hazards; Seismic risk; Seismic risk assessment; Structural assessments; Structural response analysis; Civil engineering; Decision making; Engineering geology; Losses; Risk assessment; Seismic design; Tsunamis; Information management","Waller, C.L.; Dept. of Civil Engineering, 1125 Colonel By Dr., Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, Canada",,,,9781617388446,,,"English","US Natl.

An initial issue is the impact of derivatives on the volatility of the underlying assets, but empirical findings do not suggest any significant effect. The recent literature on the dangers of derivatives is more concerned by systemic risks. Several studies suggest that the sophistication of the products and the concentration of risks are potential sources of instability because of the increasing uncertainty, the repeated occurrence of extreme losses, and finally the greater possibility of global crisis. Among the solutions that have been proposed to mitigate risk, beyond strengthening internal control, putting clearinghouses into general use and limiting naked-transactions seem to be the most promising avenues. © La Doc. française.

The key objective is to synthesise extant theory to provide a basis for evaluating implications of pressures on the regulation of financial accounting following the recent financial crisis. We succinctly lay out arguments put forth both for and against the regulation of corporate disclosure and standard-setting. We then examine current developments suggesting that accounting standard-setting is at risk of becoming entangled in a web of political forces with potentially significant consequences. The crisis has brought into sharp focus the reality that the regulation of corporate reporting is just one piece of a larger regulatory configuration, and that forces are at play that would subjugate accounting standard-setting to broader regulatory demands. Recent actions by the European Commission relating to IFRS 9 and proposed legislation in the US Congress to create a systemic risk council serve to illustrate this point. We conclude by discussing in detail the recent fair value debate as a case study of the way in which bank regulatory policy and accounting standard-setting decisions were jointly determined as a potentially socially optimal means to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.","Corporate reporting; Politics; Regulation",,"Bushman, R.; Kenan-Flagler Business School, CB #3490, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3490, United States; email: Bushman@unc.edu",,,00014788,,,,"English","Account.

In order to reach this objective, one of the main key challenge to be addressed is the design and the implementation of a Secure Mediation Gateway (SMGW), namely a new innovative network element able to: (i) discover CI status information, (ii) overcome information heterogeneity and (iii) provide a secure communication of such information among peer CIs. All the information discovered and collected by the SMGW are then provided to a dedicated prediction tool which is in charge of calculating a risk prediction for the CIs. This paper presents the functional architecture of the SMGW designed within the MICIE project, putting in evidence how it is possible to discover information and exchange critical information over a insecure network like Internet.

Over 5900 houses, of which 1600 totally destroyed, and more than 21000 people were reported by local authorities to have been affected by the floods. The most affected areas were situated in Maramures, in Moldova, along the Prut and Siret rivers. These areas include critical infrastructure elements (town halls, border police offices, roads, dams, civil protection facilities) and had a negative impact on the economic activity. The assessment of the effects of the disaster, conducted by the Operational Centre for Emergency Situations (OCES) under the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, has demonstrated the increase of the risk level with implications as systemic risk. Considering the multiple effects and the serious micro and macroeconomic implications, the intervention of the governmental institutions must be prompt and efficient. The lack of experience in the case of these extreme risk events, but also the budgetary restrictions, require, on the one hand, the reassessment of the insurance solutions through the introduction of a new financing scheme based on PPP, or the use of the microfinance products specifically created for natural hazards risk management, on the other hand. Microfinance institutions could be efficient both in disasters, and also in events that correspond to the disaster response and the recovery process. Microfinance institutions could be easily informed on the potential consequences of natural hazards at different levels: clients, institutions, sectors. Microfinance products and services could be robust solutions, because they respond more directly to clients needs in the aftermath of extreme events. Identifying the optimal lending program is a difficult task and it is closely related to the global recovery process. The design of these specific products represents an important contribution in order to develop an efficient recovery process, as the funds will be used more efficiently and promptly, and we consider that innovative solutions should be used for Romania and for other emerging countries.","Extreme risk management (ERM); Microfinance institutions (MFIs); Microinsurance","Affected area; Civil protection; Disaster response; Economic activities; Emergency situation; Extreme events; Extreme risk management (ERM); Financing schemes; Governmental institution; Heavy rainfall; Innovative solutions; Local authorities; Microfinance; Microfinance institutions (MFIs); Microinsurance; Multiple effect; Natural hazard; Negative impacts; Products and services; Recovery process; Risk levels; Robust solutions; Romania; Critical infrastructures; Economics; Floods; Rain; Rating; Recovery; Risk analysis; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Finance","Prelipcean, G.; Faculty of Economic Sciences and Public Administration, , Suceava, Romania; email: gabrielap@seap.usv.ro",,,,9789604741823,,,"English","Proc.

The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is part of this trend. The ESRB, established by a Regulation adopted in November 2010 and operational from January 2011, is an innovative EU body that occupies a pivotal position in the reinforced supervisory architecture. Governments around the world are now looking to systemic risk oversight bodies to play a major role in the prevention of future financial crises and, with the stakes so high, this is an appropriate time for close scrutiny of the ESRB to commence. ""Strengthening"" and ""reinforcing"" are words that feature prominently in many recent policy statements relating to systemic risk oversight bodies but many of these bodies, including the ESRB, are designed to operate without legally-binding powers. This raises questions about how powerful they will actually prove to be. We suggest that the ESRB's lack of formal power need not prevent it from acting in a credible and authoritative manner. We draw on the experience of soft laws and institutions in international financial regulation to support this assessment. At the same time, we emphasise that there is much about the ESRB's structure that is special because of its place within the EU constitutional and legal framework.

Innate immune reactions are tightly regulated and are resolved within hours. To understand the mechanisms underlying activation and resolution of the egg encapsulation response and examine if failure of the latter develops into systemic inflammatory disease, we correlated parasitic wasp-induced changes in the Drosophila larva with systemic chronic conditions in sumoylation-deficient mutants. We have previously reported that loss of either Cactus, the Drosophila (IkB) protein or Ubc9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, leads to constitutive activation of the humoral and cellular pathways, hematopoietic overproliferation and tumorogenesis. Here we report that parasite infection simultaneously activates NF-kB-dependent transcription of Spätzle processing enzyme (SPE) and cactus. Endogenous Spatzle protein (the Toll ligand) is expressed in immune cells and excessive SPE or Spatzle is pro-inflammatory. Consistent with this function, loss of Spz suppresses Ubc92 defects. In contrast to the pro-inflammatory roles of SPE and Spatzle, Cactus and Ubc9 exert an anti-inflammatory effect. We show that Ubc9 maintains steady state levels of Cactus protein. In a series of immuno-genetic experiments, we demonstrate the existence of a robust bidirectional interaction between blood cells and the fat body and propose that wasp infection activates Toll signaling in both compartments via extracellular activation of Spatzle. Within each organ, the IkB/Ubc9-dependent inhibitory feedback resolves immune signaling and restores homeostasis. The loss of this feedback leads to chronic inflammation. Our studies not only provide an integrated framework for understanding the molecular basis of the evolutionary arms race between insect hosts and their parasites, but also offer insights into developing novel strategies for medical and agricultural pest control.© 2010 Paddibhatla et al.",,"I kappa B; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insect protein; protein cactus; protein spaetzle; protein Ubc9; unclassified drug; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; adipose tissue; article; blood cell; chronic inflammation; Drosophila; genetic transcription; homeostasis; humoral immunity; immunogenetics; innate immunity; larva; nonhuman; parasitosis; protein analysis; protein function; sumoylation; wasp; animal; Drosophila; genetics; homeostasis; host parasite interaction; immunology; inflammation; parasitology; sumoylation; wasp; Cactaceae; Hexapoda; Vespoidea; Animals; Drosophila; Homeostasis; Host-Parasite Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Larva; NF-kappa B; Sumoylation; Transcription, Genetic; Wasps","Govind, S.; Biology Department, , New York, United States; email: sgovind@ccny.cuny.edu",,,15537366,,,"21203476","English","PLoS Pathog.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651233297

METHODS: We retrospectively ascertained demographic characteristics (age, sex, and ethnicity), presentation (history and examination findings), investigations undertaken, features of angle-closure or occludable angles (symptoms, method of diagnosis, and treatment), and outcome (intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity). RESULTS: Nineteen subjects were included in the study, comprising 9 males and 10 females, with an average age of 69 years (range 44 to 86 y). The ethnicity of the group was diverse. The mode of presentation in 75% of patients was that RVO and PAC were diagnosed at the same clinical visit. In the remaining 25% of cases, the diagnosis of PAC was delayed and ranged from 4 months to 9 years after the RVO. Increased IOP on dilation was found to have raised the suspicion of PAC in some patients, either at the time of first presentation with RVO or at a later date during follow-up for the RVO, leading to gonioscopy and a diagnosis of PAC. In 1 patient, an observed asymmetrical cup-to-disc ratio led to gonioscopy and diagnosis of PAC. Fourteen patients sustained a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), 2 subjects sustained a hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (HRVO), and 3 patients had a branch retinal vein occlusion. In the vast majority of cases in this series (18/19), no additional systemic risk factors were identified during follow-up apart from those that were present before the RVO. The diagnosis of PAC was made in all patients on the basis of static and dynamic gonioscopy. None of these patients had experienced any symptoms of acute or intermittent IOP rises as a consequence of angle-closure. Fifteen patients were diagnosed with PAC glaucoma in 1 or both eyes. Sixteen subjects (84.0%) underwent peripheral laser iridotomies and 7 patients (37.0%) had lens extraction to improve angle configuration. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the belief that angle-closure may be associated with retinal vein occlusions, and should be borne in mind and excluded when investigating the patient with RVO, especially CRVO/HRVO. We suggest that gonioscopy should be done in all patients presenting with RVO.

The beneficial elements of private equity include the creation of job opportunities and contribution to economic growth. The fact that investments are made in alternative assets makes the market somewhat opaque to outsiders, and the lack of standardised methodologies for disclosure and performance reporting limits the availability of a lender to monitor the credit quality of a borrower. The major area of (regulatory) concern in private equity relates to the use of leveraged finance. Increase in the availability of debt capital and the emergence of new funding techniques led to a private equity boom in the beginning of the 2000s, with a resulting magnification in transaction frequency and value. In addition, multiples rose, transaction structures were extended and covenants weakened. These new properties of the private equity market raised concerns about the risks associated with the provision of leveraged finance by various financial institutions. Providers of leveraged finance are now subjected to distinctive risks that in the case of realisation may have implications on financial stability. The fact that the private equity market demonstrates similarities to the US sub-prime the mortgage market has raised further concerns about systemic risk present in the sector.

The IIM for supply chain networks has been proposed, based on the original IIM used in macro-economics. A new method called the OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator has been formulated to evaluate the interdependency matrix, a key component of the IIM. Similar to the capability of the basic IIM to describe the propagation impacts of disruptions to macroeconomic systems, the IIM for supply chain networks is capable of describing the propagation effects of disruptions to interdependent supply chain components. IIM assesses the impacts of disruptions to supply chain networks with ""inoperability"" and ""economic losses"" metrics, which can provide helpful insights for risk management of supply chain networks. An example supply chain network is used to illustrate the application of IIM for systemic risk assessment of supply chains under an unsafe environment. A risk mitigation strategy by increasing the number of suppliers has been considered to reduce the adverse effects caused by the supply reduction of the single secondary supplier in the example supply chain network. In addition, a simulation model integrated with Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed to validate the accuracy of the IIM for supply chain. The example shows that the application of IIM can provide useful guidance toward supply chain risk management or mitigation strategies and it could also be used to test the effectiveness of these strategies. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","decision analysis; disruptions; inoperability input-output model; robustness metrics; supply chain safety","Adverse effect; Chain components; Decision analysis; disruptions; Disruptive event; Economic loss; inoperability input-output model; Input-output modeling; Key component; Macro-economics; matrix; Mitigation strategy; Monte Carlo simulation methods; Ordered weighted averaging; Propagation effect; Risk mitigation strategy; robustness metrics; Simulation model; Supply chain network; Supply chain risk management; Computer simulation; Decision making; Decision theory; Monte Carlo methods; Network management; Rating; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Supply chain management; Uncertainty analysis; Supply chains","Dong, M.; Antai College of Economics and Management, 535 Fahua Zhen Road, Shanghai, 200052, China; email: mdong@sjtu.edu.cn",,,10981241,,,,"English","Syst.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (WSRCPA) aims in part to address this risk by granting regulators the authority to impose prudential requirements on hedge funds. Crucial to the effectiveness of this authority will be the ability of regulators to timely and accurately identify which funds should be subject to such requirements. The WSRCPA requires U.S. hedge fund managers to self-identify the funds they manage by registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In contrast, foreign hedge fund managers whose funds do not include a threshold number of U.S. investors or amount of capital managed on behalf of U.S. investors are not required to register. As a result, to fulfill their statutory responsibility to protect the U.S. economy from systemic risks, regulators will themselves need to identify which foreign funds could pose a risk to the U.S. economy. The scope and quality of public information and the potential unreliability of international cooperation make it unlikely that U.S. regulators can accurately, promptly, and efficiently identify such funds. Exempting foreign hedge fund managers from the registration requirement therefore frustrates the ability of U.S. regulators to manage systemic risk. To fill this gap, managers of foreign hedge funds that meet thresholds for holdings of U.S. assets and obligations to U.S. lenders should be made to register with the SEC. Although the opportunity to narrow the WSRCPA's ""foreign private adviser"" exemption has passed, an alternative vehicle for bringing about self-identification exists in the SEC's proposed Large Trader Reporting System rule.",,,"Overmyer, M.

One way to do this would be to use board oversight liability to hold directors personally liable for failing to properly monitor the risks that their firms are running. The purpose of this Article is to determine what role director oversight liability can efficiently play in improving risk-management practices at large financial firms. A key contention of this Article is that previous treatments of this problem have largely failed to appreciate what risk managers at large financial firms actually do, and so the Article begins by explaining some of the financial models that risk managers typically use to measure the market risk and credit risk on portfolios of assets. A realistic appreciation of these models shows that the measurements of risk that they yield must necessarily incorporate paradigmatic business judgments, most importantly because these models aim to predict future results on the basis of historical data. In other words, the predictive ability of the models is founded on the business judgment that the future will resemble the past in relevant respects. Riskmanagement decisions are therefore always business decisions. With this conclusion firmly established, the Article reviews the principles of director oversight liability, the most relevant in this context being that oversight liability requires a showing that the directors were consciously disregarding their duties. This scienter-based standard practically guarantees that oversight claims based on alleged failures to detect and prevent weaknesses in the firm's risk-management systems will fail, as in fact happened in the Citigroup case, the most important oversight case predicated on alleged risk-management failures thus far litigated. The result in Citigroup has been subjected to much academic criticism. This Article considers these criticisms and argues that, in light of the actual nature of risk management and the financial models used therein, these criticisms are generally misguided. The result in Citigroup has also prompted proposals for expanding oversight liability in ways that would allow courts to review substantive risk-management decisions by corporate boards. The Article argues that such proposals are meritless for two reasons. First, because riskmanagement decisions are always business decisions, and because any business decision leading to losses for the company can be characterized as a risk-management failure, allowing courts to review risk-management decisions in oversight liability cases would, in effect, repeal the business judgment rule. Second, although such proposed expansions of oversight liability are aimed at limiting the excessive risk taking that supposedly contributed to the financial crisis, risk taking can be excessive in several distinct ways, and the sense in which excessive risk taking represents a genuine failure of risk-management systems (namely, risk taking in excess of the risk tolerance of the firm as set by the board) is not the sense in which excessive risk taking may have been a cause of the financial crisis (namely, socially inefficient risk taking or excessive systemic risk). Hence, even if expanding oversight liability for risk-management failures did not otherwise involve the tremendous inefficiency of effectively repealing the business judgment rule, such an expansion would still not be well calculated to address the perceived problem of excessive risk taking as a cause of the financial crisis. This Article concludes that director oversight liability has little or no role to play in improving risk-management practices at major financial firms.",,,"Miller, R.

Methods:- Collaborative multi-centre retrospective case series. Results:- Eight patients were documented to have central retinal artery occlusion (four patients), branch retinal artery occlusion, capillary occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion (one patient each) within 0-55days (median 2weeks) of intravitreal bevacizumab. All patients had several ocular and systemic risk factors for retinal vascular events: elevated intraocular pressure on discharge (four patients), pre-existent glaucoma (one patient), pre-existent ischaemic retinal vascular disorder (four patients), systemic hypertension (five patients), diabetes mellitus (three patients), coronary artery disease (four patients), carotid disease (three patients), smoking (two patients) and migraine (one patient). Conclusion:- The retinal vascular events may be associated with the underlying ocular disease under treatment or with the underlying systemic disease, may be related to an increased intraocular pressure post-injection constraining further an already poor retinal perfusion, the vasoconstrictor effect of bevacizumab, or a combination of all three. © 2009 Acta Ophthalmol.","bevacizumab; branch retinal artery occlusion; branch retinal vein occlusion; capillary occlusion; central retinal artery occlusion; central retinal vein occlusion","bevacizumab; adult; aged; article; branch retinal artery occlusion; branch retinal vein occlusion; carotid artery disease; central retina artery occlusion; central retina vein occlusion; clinical article; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; female; glaucoma; human; hypertension; intraocular pressure; male; migraine; priority journal; smoking habit; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetic Retinopathy; Eye Diseases; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Fundus Oculi; Glaucoma; Humans; Hypertension; Injections, Intraocular; Male; Middle Aged; Ocular Hypertension; Retinal Artery Occlusion; Retinal Diseases; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Smoking; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Vitreous Body","Mansour, A.

Patients affected notice sudden and painless loss of vision in 1 eye, often upon awaking. Studies have found that the opposite eye may be affected in approximately 15% to 20% of cases within a 5-year period. NAION vision loss results from an ischemic event often affecting the short posterior ciliary arteries. This results in optic nerve pallor, nerve fiber layer defects, and corresponding visual field defects. Case Reports: Two cases of NAION are discussed here. The first patient, a 57-year-old woman, had a 10-year history of visual symptoms, and the second, a 66-year-old man, presented in less than a week after first noticing symptoms. Both had predisposing systemic risk factors and resultant visual field loss and decreased visual acuity. Conclusions: Predisposing factors for NAION include small cup-to-disc ratios of the optic nerve, obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal hypotension, diabetes, and other vascular diseases. The vision loss is irreversible, and there is no known effective treatment to prevent subsequent disc atrophy or recurring episodes. © 2010 .","Diabetes; Nocturnal hypotension; Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy; Nonarteritic posterior optic neuropathy; Obstructive sleep apnea","aged; article; case report; female; human; ischemic optic neuropathy; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; risk factor; visual acuity; visual disorder; visual field; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic; Risk Factors; Vision Disorders; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields","Singh, G.7 Della Ct., Savoy, IL, United States; email: jagheral@yahoo.com",,,15291839,,,"21035747","English","Optometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958565066

Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses.

The G-20 re-tasked the Fund and tripled its lending capacity. Notwithstanding its new windfall and duties, the Fund's legitimacy and effectiveness are in doubt. The main challenges center on disagreements between the Western European nations and emerging markets over the Fund's governance and focus, a specter of disintegration of the global crisis management architecture by way of bilateral and regional financial arrangements (particularly in Asia), and limitations to the Fund's responsiveness to major crises. Yet the threat of global financial instability persists, and the Fund is uniquely qualified to counter it. The United States, the Fund's founder and main shareholder, has sponsored sound reforms to the Fund in the context of the G-20. However, farther-reaching paradigmatic changes are required for the Fund to effectively manage global economic instability in the 21st century: focusing the Fund's analytical powers squarely on systemic risks and largest economies rather than on small, developing nations; turning the Fund from a crisis firefighter into a global preventive care unit that rewards members for sound policies; and making the Fund a bridge between public and private insurance markets.

Huge costs are borne by every part of society. Much wealth has been destroyed. Millions of jobs have been lost. The crisis has tarnished faith in free enterprise, in the financial system, and in financial theory. Likely, the era of laissez-faire capitalism that started during the Reagan-Thatcher years is ending. We are entering a period of profound uncertainty. It is imperative that the moral dimension of capitalism be restored. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a review of theory and historical evidence relating to financial bubbles and financial regulation. Findings – The author offers suggestions on how to rebuild the global financial system. We need: a systemic risk regulator, independent from business and political influence; higher capital requirements for all systemically significant financial service firms; restrictions on proprietary trading in commercial banks; transparency in derivatives; new ways to compensate bankers that reduce the incentive to take excessive risks; consumer protection against defective financial products; and the re-establishment of the principle of fiduciary duty. Practical implications – The paper lists practical suggestions on how to reform the global financial system. Social implications – Economic success is based on trust. After the 2008 crisis, regulatory reform is the best way to rebuild trust in the financial system. Originality/value – The paper offers a unique perspective based in part on insights drawn from behavioral finance. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural economics; Capitalist systems; Economic reform; Regulation; World economy",,"De Bondt, W.; Richard H.

Those works that do consider sustainability find that sterilization is possible in the long run if domestic interest rates remain below foreign rates; if capital markets are imperfect; or if the scale of sterilization does not become too large. This paper asserts that sterilization may not be possible in the long run since it engenders a spirit of moral hazard, thus increasing systemic risk within the banking system, leading to a highly risky, speculative bubble. Loading the banking system with low risk, low yielding sterilization assets encourages banks to seek out riskier investments to balance their unduly secure portfolios. China is considered to be a good example of this phenomenon. China has engaged in massive sterilization over the last five years and has consequently experienced a bubble in lending. As a result, China will quite likely be forced by objective circumstances to reduce the scale of its sterilization efforts and allow greater flexibility of its currency in the future.","Foreign exchange reserves; Monetary policy; Moral hazard",,"Kleykamp, D.; Department of Economics, Taiwan",,,10274979,,,,"English","Tamkang J.

We analyse this dual role at the macro and the micro levels. At the aggregate level, we construct a new measure of currency mismatch in the banking sector that controls for bank lending to unhedged borrowers - that is, those with no foreign currency income. Using our measure, we find that across emerging European economies, increases in currency mismatch are associated with higher growth in tranquil times, but also with more severe crises. On net, after taking into account the crisis period, we find a positive link between currency mismatch and growth. These results are also confirmed for a broader sample of emerging economies. In our firm-level analysis, we find that in emerging Europe, currency mismatch relaxes borrowing constraints, reduces interest rates and enhances growth across sets of firms that arguably are the most credit constrained - that is, small firms in non-tradables sectors - but not across large firms. An advantage of our approach is that it considers both listed and non-listed firms, and so we are able to effectively capture the effects of currency mismatch across the entire economy, not just the financially privileged stock market listed firms. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2010.",,"banking; currency; economic growth; interest rate; Europe","Ranciere, R.; Paris School of Economics and International Monetary Fund, United States",,,02664658,,,,"English","Econ.

Recent Findings: At arterial curvatures, bifurcations and branches unique hemodynamics influence endothelial cell signaling and gene expression patterns, which create a proinflammatory environment, with low-grade recruitment of monocytes and accumulation of cells with dendritic features in the intima. Upon induction of hypercholesterolemia, these resident intimal dendritic cells initiate atherosclerosis by rapidly engulfing lipid and becoming the first foam cells in nascent lesions. This step precedes endothelial cell activation and increased monocyte recruitment. Summary: The unique features of the arterial intima at atherosclerosis-susceptible sites do not lead to disease under normal physiological conditions, but this intimal environment promotes the initiation of atherogenesis upon induction of systemic risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","dendritic cells; endothelium; gene expression; hemodynamics; monocytes","lipid; aorta; artery intima; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; cell activation; dendritic cell; disease predisposition; endothelium cell; foam cell; gene expression; genetic susceptibility; hemodynamics; hypercholesterolemia; monocyte; nonhuman; priority journal; review; risk factor; Animals; Aorta; Atherosclerosis; Dendritic Cells; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hemorheology; Humans; Tunica Intima","Cybulsky, M.

We assess the power of scenarios as frames and their role in re-framing strategic conversation; and contrast the misapplication of probability in systemic risk analysis with the co-production of plausibility, between builders and users of scenarios.

Many consider hedge funds a potential threat to financial stability. Regulating hedge funds, however, is necessarily a transnational challenge because no national government alone can effectively control the systemic risks affecting its economy. This article takes the example of hedge funds for a case study of emerging transnational regulation. After an introduction to hedge funds and the reasons for regulating them, it considers the possible elements of a transnational regulatory regime for hedge funds: transnational industry self-regulation, including such induced by the government, regulatory competition between government regulators, and harmonisation of government regulation. The main conclusions are: self-regulation cannot substitute fully for government regulation in controlling systemic risks caused by hedge funds. Equally, regulatory competition tends to undercut systemic risk regulation. Effective transnational regulation can only be accomplished through harmonisation of government regulation. Such harmonisation is likely to arise if regulation is needed to control systemic risk in global financial markets. Copyright © 2010 T.M.C.

Focus on Bisphosphonates (BPs) and Bisphosphonates Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (B-ONJ), are an important class of drugs that are useful in the treatment of certain metabolic and oncologic diseases of the skeletal system. Their efficacy in the treatment and palliative care of patient with these diseases is indisputable, but avascular osteonecrosis of the jaws (B-ONJ) has recently been reported as an adverse effect of intravenous BP therapy and with prolonged therapy with oral BPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the most recent scientific literature on B-ONJ in an attempt to characterize this adverse event from an epidemiological point of view and to elaborate guidelines for its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. RESULTS. B-ONJ usually arises in the mandible, in most cases at the level of mylohyoid line; involvement of the upper jaw is less common. It normally occurs after a dental extraction or other types of oral surgery, but it can also develop spontaneously. In cases of the latter type, systemic risk factors (e.g., comorbidities, concomitant therapies), or local pathological/anatomical conditions of the oral cavity play an important role. For patients without identified risk factors, intravenous BP therapy is associated with an estimated incidence of B-ONJ between 0.8 and 1.15%; figures may be as high as 9.1% if these patients undergo dentoalveolar surgery. In patients treated with oral BF, the incidence rate ranges from 0.01 to 0.04% and increases to 0.09%-0.34% after extractions. None of the treatments currentIy used to treat B-ONJ are completely effective and predictable, so prevention is essential for patients receiving BPs. Oral and dental risk factors should be eliminated before BP therapy begins, and this requires close collaboration by the patient's physician and dentist. After BP therapy has been started, there are relative contraindications to dentoalveolar surgery, and only unavoidable procedures should be performed. If B-ONJ develops, the best clinical results are achieved with combined treatment that includes antibiotics, antiseptic mouthwashes, surgical removal of necrotic bone, surgical debridement, biostimulation with low-level laser therapy and ozone-therapy. CONCLUSIONS. B-ONJ is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of BP therapy. It can produce significant morbidity and severely diminish the quality of life. The prognosis appears poor even when appropriate treatment is provided. Since the first cases of B-ONJ have been reported, considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease and its risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, therapy, and management of the complications.","Adverse effects; Bisphosphonates; Oral pathology; Osteonecrosis; Prevention","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; mouthwash; debridement; dental surgery; dentist; drug efficacy; human; jaw osteonecrosis; palliative therapy; pathogenesis; physician; quality of life; review; risk factor; tooth extraction","Annibali, S.; Dipartimento di Scienze Odontostomatologiche, via Caserta 6, 00161 Roma, Italy; email: susanna.annibali@uniromal.it",,,00118524,,,,"Italian","Dent.

It argues that the current extensive over-the-counter trading of CDSs raises problems in terms of the opacity of risk, misaligned incentives in the event of default by reference entities, and concentrations of counterparty risk, each of which requires addressing. Among the proposals discussed are the standardisation of CDSs, the use of central counterparties, the introduction of exchange trading of CDSs, the imposition of capital penalties on bespoke CDSs or mandatory collateralisation, limiting the extent to which CDSs can be used to hedge a position fully, the prohibition of naked CDS protection and the introduction of large exposure counterparty limits. The article concludes that while standardisation and exchange trading of CDSs should be promoted, mandatory collateralisation is preferable to the use of capital penalties. Naked CDS protection buying should be prohibited unless measures can be put in place to ensure that it does not have adverse effects in the event of default by reference entities.

Administrations and regulatory bodies have to publish rules for the protection of the public, decide whether to authorize the use of a chemical product or the construction of a new plant, limit the environmental impact, regulate waste disposal, etc. All these rules i.e. the legislative, normative and procedural corpus of a country, a state, a city or a factory can be designated to a barrier function. These barriers are indispensable and can play an important role in industrial safety management. In developed countries, growth during the past few years in the number of laws directed at regulating environmental and safety aspects in industry is well known to everyone. And we consider that the definition, classification and performance of the legislative and normative barriers definitely allows the management of technological risks to perform risk reduction in order to enhance the acceptability in a regional context and permits, for a group of events, the identification of the flux of danger. We applied a systemic risk analysis methodology (MADS/MOSAR methodology) to Colombian industrial sectors and analyzed the current Colombian legislation link with three scenarios (a technological accident with an explosion, an occupational risk and a landscape alteration caused by a post-exploitation scenario). In fine, we can generate a global panorama of the different existing instruments allowing future management opportunities. Our analysis results propose a point of view, which could be useful for a local government or a whole national system to evaluate or improve the risk legislative and normative barriers. This modeling can, of course, be applied to other countries and other industrial sectors.","Legislation; MADS; MOSAR; Safety barrier","Analysis results; Barrier functions; Chemical products; Colombians; Developed countries; Industrial safety; Industrial sector; Local government; Regulatory bodies; Risk reductions; Safety aspects; Safety barriers; Technological risk; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Explosions; Industry; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety factor; Waste disposal; Occupational risks","Perrin, L.; CNRS LRGP, 1, rue Grandville, 54001 Nancy Cedex, France; email: perrin@ensic.inpl-nancy.fr",,,,9780816910649,,,"English","AIChE Annu.

Congress, as a result, is left with the question of how best to handle the failure of systemically significant financial companies (SSFCs). In the United States, the insolvencies of depository institutions (i.e., banks and thrifts with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)) are not handled according to the procedures of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, they and their subsidiaries are subject to a separate regime prescribed in federal law, called a conservatorship or receivership. Under this regime, the conservator or receiver, which generally is the FDIC, is provided substantial authority to deal with virtually every aspect of the insolvency. However, the failure of most other financial institutions within bank, thrift, and financial holding company umbrellas (including the holding companies themselves) generally are dealt with under the Bankruptcy Code. In March of 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner proposed legislation that would impose a conservatorship/receivership regime, much like that for depository institutions, on insolvent financial institutions that are deemed systemically significant. In order to make a policy assessment concerning the appropriateness of this proposal, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences between insured depositories and other financial institutions large enough or interconnected enough to pose systemic risk to the U.S. economy upon failure, as well as the differences between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority. This report first discusses the purposes behind the creation of a separate insolvency regime for depository institutions. The report then compares and contrasts the characteristics of depository institutions with SSFCs. Next, the report provides a brief analysis of some important differences between the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority and that of the Bankruptcy Code. The specific differences discussed are: (1) overall objectives of each regime; (2) insolvency initiation authority and timing; (3) oversight structure and appeal; (4) management, shareholder, and creditor rights; (5) FDIC -superpowers,‖ including contract repudiation versus Bankruptcy's automatic stay; and (6) speed of resolution. This report makes no value judgment as to whether an insolvency regime for SSFCs that is modeled after the FDIC's conservatorship/receivership authority is more appropriate than using (or adapting) the Bankruptcy Code. Rather, it simply points out the similarities and differences between SSFCs and depository institutions, and compares the conservatorship/receivership insolvency regime with the Bankruptcy Code to help the reader develop his/her own opinion. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Carpenter, D.H.",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781612099033; 9781608768011,,,"English","Insolv.

Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on patients who underwent cataract surgery in a public hospital over an 11-year period. An ocular infection database was used to report endophthalmitis occurrences and to collect the clinical features. Qualitative variables are described with their frequency distribution and qualitative variables, with the mean and the standard deviation. Results: From January 1999 to December 2009, 15.173 patients underwent cataract surgery. A total of 43 patients suffered from postoperative endophthalmitis, giving an overall infection rate of 0.28% (95% CI: 0.20-0.36%). Among the 43 cases, there were 19 men and 24 women with a mean age of 78.5. Other clinical parameters evaluated were as follows: 25.58% were diabetic, 44.18% had some degree of immunosuppression and there were complications with posterior capsular tears in 18.6%. As regards antibiotic prophylaxis, 2 groups were considered: the first one did not receive intracameral antibiotic (8,099 patients) and the second group received intracameral cefuroxime (7,074 patients). There were 39 endophthalmitis in the first group with an infection incidence of 0.48% and 4 endophthalmitis in the second group with an infection incidence of 0.056%. The relative risk (RR) after-before cefuroxime was 0.12 (0.04-0.33) with P < 0.05. Conclusions: The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in an 11-year period was lower than 0.3%. Almost half of the patients had a higher systemic risk. Intracameral cefuroxime resulted in nearly a 9-fold reduction in the rate of infection. © 2010 Sociedad Española de Oftalmología.

Tightly but inversely connected, risks generated by either the production or non-production of medical isotopes are multidimensional and located on both the demand (healthy citizens and their well-being) and supply (safety of production) sides. The decision making also involves multidisciplinary considerations. Another feature of the process is the geographic scale. Production goes beyond domestic needs as global society depends on medical isotopes and must rely on very few producers.

The pathogenesis of DME is complex and multifactorial, and involves both local and systemic risk factors that may alter the blood-retina barrier and allow leakage of protein and fluid into the macula. Recently, in addition to well known risk factors, the use of thiazolidinediones (glitazones) has been related to the development and worsening of DME. This review is based on available literature derived from EMBASE and MEDLINE, from 1950 to May 2010, and focuses on the potential correlations between DME and current available therapies for type 1 and 2 diabetes.This review reveals that the current literature, with the potential exception of glitazones, is not sufficient for a definite statement on the association between DME and currently available diabetic therapies. In fact, among antidiabetic agents, the class of glitazones appears the only one to be potentially associated with DME. Furthermore, adequately powered, prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the exact causal association between glitazones and DME and to exclude the role of other confounding factors potentially able to induce or exacerbate macular edema. Improvement of the quality and reporting in postmarketing surveillance and the use of the 'dechallenge and rechallenge' approach in case of suspicious causeeffect drug relationship of DME are highly encouraged. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

Design/methodology/approach: Considering several performance variables, this analysis compares the benefits of diversification across different bank types relative to margin income and fee income. Further, regression analysis considers bank risk and revenue concentration. Findings: This paper documents that fee-based income is riskier than margin income but offers diversification benefits to bank shareholders. While improving bank risk-return tradeoff, these benefits are of second order importance compared to the large negative impact of poor asset quality on shareholder returns. Practical implications: These results have implications for all stakeholders in Australian banks. The results suggest that shareholders of banks will benefit from increased bank exposure to non-interest income via diversification. From a regulatory perspective, diversification reduces the possibility of systemic risk, but caution must be offered with respect to banks pursuing absolute returns rather than monitoring risk-return trade-offs, and so exploiting the benefits of the implied guarantee offered by ""too big to fail"" However, shareholders should also monitor bank exposure to non interest income to ensure that they do not become over-exposed to the point where the volatility effect outweighs the diversification benefits. Originality/value: The results of this study suggest that Australian regulators should consider requiring increased disclosure of the composition of bank non-interest income. Such disclosure would aid in understanding the changing nature of banking in Australia. Given the recent sub-prime crisis in the USA and the role played by fee based income sourced from securitization, increased disclosure of the nature of bank non interest income is now of global importance. This disclosure is particularly germane within the context of the implementation of Basle II, with its increased emphasis upon market discipline, given that Stiroh found increased disclosure in this area is accompanied by improved market pricing for risk. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Banks; Diversification; Income; Risk management",,"Williams, B.; School of Business, , Robina, Australia; email: Barry_Williams@bond.edu.au",,,17439132,,,,"English","Int.

Many of these events, defined as emerging catastrophic (or systemic) risks, have no previous record. At the same time there is a strong probability that their frequency and impact will increase in the future. This paper takes a governance perspective by assuming that policy actions should be designed to cope with ignorance and large-scale losses, being the primary features characterising such emerging catastrophic risks. Precisely, the governance activity should aim both at expanding the industries capacity to absorb losses and at acquiring more information about frequency and impact of such losses. However, it appears that some solutions may conflict with policy objectives. In particular, direct governmental interventions to compensate victims and stringent antitrust policy goals might block the development of a market for first-party property insurance for emerging systemic risks. This paper elicits crucial points that require further elaboration by policy-makers, thereby stressing the importance of providing a workable legal definition of such line of risk that embraces the precautionary principle. © 2010 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.","antitrust; Block Exemption Regulation; emerging catastrophic risks; new risks; pooling; precautionary principle",,"Castellano, G.; Pole de Recherche en Gestion (PREG), 32 Boulevard Victor, PARIS Cedex 15 75739, France; email: giuliano.castellano@polytechnique.edu",,,10185895,,,,"English","Geneva Pap. on Risk Insur.

We first generate market-based measures of banks' systemic risk exposures using extreme value analysis. Systemic banking risk is measured as the tail beta, which equals the probability of a sharp decline in a bank's stock price conditional on a crash in a banking index. Subsequently, the impact of (the correlation between) interest income and the components of non-interest income on this risk measure is assessed. The heterogeneity in extreme bank risk is attributed to differences in the scope of non-traditional banking activities: non-interest generating activities increase banks' tail beta. In addition, smaller banks and better-capitalized banks are better able to withstand extremely adverse conditions. These relationships are stronger during turbulent times compared to normal economic conditions. Overall, diversifying financial activities under one umbrella institution does not improve banking system stability, which may explain why financial conglomerates trade at a discount. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Policymakers' support of creative forms of risk-taking and their proclivity for absorbing losses in crisis situations encourage opportunistic firms to foster and exploit incentive conflicts within the supervisory sector. To restore faith in the diligence, competence, and integrity of officials responsible for managing the financial safety net, reforms need to rework incentives in the government and financial sectors. The goal should be to align the incentives of private risk managers, accountants, credit-rating firms, and government supervisors with those of ordinary taxpayers. This article describes a series of complementary ways of advancing toward this goal. The most important steps would be to measure regulatory performance in terms of its effect on the loss exposures that the safety net passes through to taxpayers and to require institutions that benefit from the net to produce information that would support this effort. This entails estimating the explicit and implicit safety-net benefits individual institutions receive and issuing extended liability securities whose prices would improve the accuracy of these estimates. © 2010 International Atlantic Economic Society.","Financial crisis; Insolvency detection; Safety net subsidies; Systemic risk",,"Kane, E.

Meeting this goal requires reducing the impact and frequency of financial institution failures that cause systemic risk. Any regulatory structure, however, inevitably involves tradeoffs. A policy that effectively reduces systemic risk and its associated costs might also increase moral hazard. Similarly, a policy that seeks to reduce moral hazard and maintain market discipline-for example, by allowing a large interconnected institution such as Lehman Brothers to fail-might also create uncertainty, which can harm markets by creating panic. In this Note, I argue that our current regulatory structure is suboptimal in its regulation of systemic risk. A different regulatory structure could more effectively reduce the systemic risk caused by failing non-bank financial institutions, while minimizing the attendant problems caused by the regulations themselves-moral hazard and uncertainty. The federal government could strike a superior balance by establishing more stringent ex ante prudential regulations of systemically important non-bank financial institutions aimed at curbing excessive risk-taking and by implementing a regulatory process to resolve the failure of such institutions. The Obama Administration has proposed regulatory reform that endorses such beneficial changes, but certain details in the proposal fall short. I propose specific modifications to the Administration's proposal to produce a more optimal regulatory framework. By pinpointing and examining the strengths and weaknesses of the Administration's approach, I formulate a regulatory framework that more effectively contains systemic risk, avoids increasing moral hazard, and reduces excessive uncertainty caused by regulation.

To examine the prevalence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and its systemic relevant factors in a general Japanese population aged 40 years or older. Methods. In 1998, 1775 Hisayama residents consented to participate in the study. Each participant underwent a comprehensive examination that included ophthalmic testing. RVO was determined by grading color fundus photographs. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for RVO. Results. Of the 1775 subjects examined, 38 had RVO. The prevalence of RVO was 2.1% (2.0% for branch RVO and 0.2% for central RVO). After adjustment for age and sex, it was found that systolic and diastolic blood pressures, hypertension, and hematocrit were significantly associated with RVO. In multi-variate analysis, age (per 10 years; odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.08), hypertension (OR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.82-9.94), and hematocrit (per 10%; OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.10-1.22) remained independently significant risk factors for RVO. Both high-normal blood pressure and hypertension were significantly associated with RVO. Furthermore, compared with normotensive subjects without high hematocrit, the likelihood of RVO was markedly high in subjects having both high blood pressure and high hematocrit Conclusions. The findings suggest that the prevalence of RVO is higher in the Japanese than in other Asians or Caucasians and that older age, higher hematocrit, and both hypertension and high-normal blood pressure are significant risk factors for RVO in the Japanese. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.",,"adult; age distribution; aged; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; female; hematocrit; human; hypertension; Japanese; major clinical study; male; population research; prevalence; priority journal; retina vein occlusion; risk assessment; risk factor; systolic blood pressure; thrombocyte count; Asian; blood pressure; ethnology; glucose blood level; hypertension; Japan; middle aged; prevalence; prospective study; retina vein occlusion; risk; risk factor; sex ratio; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hematocrit; Humans; Hypertension; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution","Yasuda, M.; Departments of Ophthalmology, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan; email: miho-m@med.kyushu-u.ac.jp",,,01460404,,IOVSD,"20071683","English","Invest.

This paper analyzes spillover effects during the Northern Rock episode and shows that both the bank run and the subsequent bailout announcement had significant effects on the rest of the U.K. banking system, as measured by abnormal returns on the stock prices of banks. The paper also shows that the effects were a rational response by investors to market news about the liability side of banks' balance sheets. In particular, banks that rely on funding from wholesale markets were significantly affected, a result consistent with the drying up of liquidity in wholesale markets and the record-high levels of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) during the crisis. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bailout; Bank run; Banking crisis; Contagion; Event study; Liquidity; Systemic risk",,"Yorulmazer, T.; Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 33 Liberty Street, New York, NY 10045, United States; email: Tanju.Yorulmazer@ny.frb.org",,,09208550,,,,"English","J.

It can be a challenging task to develop informed policies for such risks. Integrated environmental health impact assessment aims to support policy by assessing environmental health effects in ways that take into account the complexities and uncertainties involved. For such assessment to be successful, a clear and agreed conceptual framework is needed, which defines the issue under consideration and sets out the principles on which the assessment is based. Conceptual frameworks facilitate involvement of stakeholders, support harmonized discussions, help to make assumptions explicit, and provide a framework for data analysis and interpretation.Various conceptual frameworks have been developed for different purposes, but as yet no clear taxonomy exists. We propose a three-level taxonomy of conceptual frameworks for use in environmental health impact assessment. At the first level of the taxonomy, structural frameworks show the wide context of the issues at hand. At the second level, relational frameworks describe how the assessment variables are causally related. At the third level, this causal structure is translated into an operational model, which serves as a basis for analysis. The different types of frameworks are complementary and all play a role in the assessment process. The taxonomy is illustrated using a hypothetical assessment of urban brownfield development for residential uses.We suggest that a better understanding of types of conceptual frameworks and their potential roles in the different phases of assessment will contribute to more informed assessments and policies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment; Causal diagrams; Causality; Conceptual framework; Environment; Health; Model; Systemic risks","Causal diagram; Causal diagrams; Causality; Conceptual framework; Conceptual frameworks; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Health; Risk assessment; Taxonomies; Uncertainty analysis; Health risks; complexity; conceptual framework; diagram; environmental impact assessment; environmental risk; integrated approach; modeling; risk assessment; article; conceptual framework; data analysis; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; health hazard; information processing; interpersonal communication; policy; priority journal; residential area; risk assessment; urban area; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Europe; International Cooperation; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment; Systems Theory; Urbanization","Knol, A.B.; Nat Inst Public Health and the Environment, RIVM, Postbak 10, PO Box 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands; email: Anne.knol@rivm.nl",,,00489697,,STEVA,"20406707","English","Sci.

System-specific ratios are first developed to extract bilateral payment obligations from aggregate payments data in the Australian RTGS system. This synthetic data is then used to generate a deferred net settlement (DNS) system of similar dimensions to those the Australian system would have had, had RTGS not been introduced. Standard default simulation methodology is then applied to test the levels of systemic risk in both this system and the corresponding RTGS system to ascertain the degree to which the introduction of RTGS is likely to have reduced the level of risk. We find that while the level of systemic risk is likely to have been reduced in the Australian case, the size of the effect is small, a finding consistent with the results of payments system studies in other countries. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Recent initiatives, especially the work of the G20 and the creation of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), indicate greater interest in worldwide coordination of financial regulatory intervention. The financial crisis has however dealt a serious blow to the previously existing international dialogue, and a fear exists that the main regulators may withdraw to their national battlefields. Major changes in the supervisory architecture are planned in the European Union: a more detailed coordinated app-roach to regulation and to monitoring the application of existing regulations is proposed by creating a European System of Financial Supervisors. A European Systemic Risk Board will also be introduced. These and comparable changes in the US may contribute to reactivating the regulatory dialogue. The core challenge remains that of effective application of the agreements, both at the regional and the international level, and there is no ready answer to this. Policy Implications: • International and local regulation should be coordinated. • Regulators should coordinate better, as markets are international, and regulatory arbitrage may undermine effectiveness. • Macro and micro supervision have to be integrated without losing their specificity. • The present cooperation mechanisms have been conceived for fair weather. • Adequate instruments have to be developed to deal with a financial crisis, at both regional and international levels. © 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"Wymeersch, E.; Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR)France",,,17585880,,,,"English","Global Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955876115

Over the past four decades, numerous assumptions underlying the operation of free markets had developed to the point of being virtually unassailable. Rational profit-maximizing behavior on the part of many leads to optimal, self-sustaining equilibria. Markets self-correct, such that many (indeed most) distortions will be ephemeral. Financial markets are efficient, which means that even large-scale entry in capital intensive markets can safely be presumed where supracompetitive prices await. In cases of uncertainty, enforcers should err on the side of false negatives by presuming the existence of competitive markets. In short, the free market works. Certain of these assumptions now lie in ruins. For the antitrust proponent who developed his thinking based on such principles, the global market meltdown poses an unprecedented predicament. Yet, when all the dust has settled, it is not clear what the objective lessons of the crisis will be for competition policy. The global recession certainly teaches that assumptions of efficiency are misplaced where systemic risk and uncertainty pervade the marketplace. It questions the wisdom of a financial system that becomes concentrated to a point where the failure of one key player triggers the collapse of others. It reveals that monetary policy alone cannot control all macroeconomic fluctuations. It raises fundamental questions about the role of regulation, not just in terms of domestic scope, but in efficacy and global reach too. But for all this, it does not say much about antitrust analysis. Many have missed this point, and missed badly. Competition enforcers, politicians, and commentators are falling prey to an alluring, yet simplistic and myopic view. They posit that the economic dogma that ushered in today's extraordinary global recession is inextricably linked to the tenets of price theory that inform antitrust doctrine. They are mistaken. This Article explores the normative repercussions of the global recession for competition policy and explains that minimal readjustment is counseled under the rubric of economics. Nevertheless, past shifts in substantive policy have coincided with larger changes in political thinking. The crisis has undermined U.S. faith in the free market, a development that portends a deviation from the law's cautious approach to economic conduct of indeterminate long-run competitive effect. Such a shift is difficult to justify, but is likely inevitable.",,,"Devlin, A.; U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh CircuitUnited States",,,01934872,,,,"English","Harv. J.

This Article identifies a pervasive opportunism hazard created by contingent debt that lawmakers and scholars have overlooked. If liability on a firm's contingent debt is especially likely to be triggered when the firm is insolvent, the contract that creates the debt transfers wealth from the firm's creditors to its shareholders. A firm therefore has incentive to engage in correlation-seeking- that is, to incur contingent debts that correlate, or that through asset purchases can be made to correlate, with the firm's insolvency risk. The consequence is an overuse of contingent debt that destroys social wealth through overinvestment, higher borrowing costs, financial distress, and potential systemic risk. Correlation-seeking is especially pernicious because, unlike other forms of shareholder opportunism such as asset substitution, it can reduce risk to shareholders even as it increases shareholder returns. Conduct thai is consistent with correlation-seeking played a central role in the 2008 financial crisis, causing the deep losses suffered by the three firms to receive the biggest bailouts: AIG, Fannie Mae, and, Freddie Mac. Yet current and proposed, legal rules for derivatives and, other contingent debt contracts ignore matters of correlation, increasing the risk of another financial crash in the future.",,,"Squire, R.; Fordham Law SchoolUnited States",,,0017811X,,,,"English","Harv.

Materials and Methods: The data of babies with retinopathy of prematurity were retrospectively evaluated. The babies who received laser photocoagulation and/or cryotherapy were divided into three groups according to fundus findings, babies who represented regression without complication were included in group 1, babies who represented with regression of retinopathy with fundus findings such as dragging of papilla or macula, fibrotic band formation were included in group 2 and babies who represented cicatricial fundus findings and showed progression despite treatment were included in group 3. Birth weight, gestational age, retinopathy grade and association with systemic risk factors were investigated. Results: At initial examination retinopathy of prematurity was established in 310 (55.1%) of 562 infants. One hundred sixty six (53.5%) of 310 babies were treated with laser photocoagulation and/or cryotherapy. At the end of follow up period, 146 of 166 babies were compared in the terms of final fundus findings.

To bring out the 'true value' of nature and make conservation compatible with poverty reduction, so the argument goes, it must be appropriated into the realm of commodities and priced in monetary terms. By employing the concept of 'derivative nature', this paper explores the consequences of this neoliberal move. Derivatives are financial mechanisms whose monetary value is literally derived from the value of underlying assets. They were originally devised to reduce risk in the marketplace, but have actually made the global financial market immensely more complex and created more systemic risk and uncertainty because of their susceptibility to speculation. The paper suggests that similar processes can be seen in the arena of conservation. It argues that both nature and 'the poor' are increasingly becoming 'underlying assets' for what has become the 'real' source of value of neoliberal conservation, namely images and symbols within the realms of branding, public relations and marketing. Empirically grounded in a discussion on transfrontier conservation in Southern Africa in the run-up to the 2010 soccer World Cup, the paper examines the consequences of 'derivative nature' and calls for critical thinking to start facing these consequences. © 2010 Third World Quarterly.",,"conservation planning; environmental issue; environmental planning; nature conservation; neoliberalism; South Africa","Bram, B.; Institute of Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, 2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; email: buscher@iss.nl",,,01436597,,,,"English","Third World Q.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951444752

In particular, as managers realize the size of potential exposure to unmanaged risk, insuring ""business continuity"" (BC) is becoming a key task within all industrial and financial sectors (Figure 1). Aside from terrorism and natural disasters, two main reasons for developing the BC approach in the finance sector have been identified as unique to it: regulations and business specificities. Regulatory norms are key factors for all financial sectors in every country. Every organization is required to comply with federal/national law in addition to national and international governing bodies. Referring to business decisions, more and more organizations recognize that Business Continuity could be and should be strategic for the good of the business. The finance sector is, as a matter of fact, a sector in which the development of information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) have had a dramatic effect upon competitiveness. In this sector, organizations have become dependent upon technologies that they do not fully comprehend. In fact, banking industry IT and IS are considered production not support technologies. As such, IT and IS have supported massive changes in the ways in which business is conducted with consumers at the retail level. Innovations in direct banking would have been unthinkable without appropriate IS. As a consequence business continuity planning at banks is essential as the industry develops in order to safeguard consumers and to comply with international regulatory norms. Furthermore, in the banking industry, BC planning is important and at the same time different from other industries, for three other specific reasons as highlighted by the Bank of Japan in 2003: Maintaining the economic activity of residents in disaster areas by enabling the continuation of financial services during and after disasters, thereby sustaining business activities in the damaged area; Preventing widespread payment and settlement disorder or preventing systemic risks, by bounding the inability of financial institutions in a disaster area to execute payment transactions; Reduce managerial risks for example, by limiting the difficulties for banks to take profit opportunities and lower their customer reputation. Business specificities, rather than regulatory considerations, should be the primary drivers of all processes. Even if European (EU) and US markets differ, BC is closing the gap. Progressive EU market consolidation necessitates common rules and is forcing major institutions to share common knowledge both on organizational and technological issues. The financial sector sees business continuity not only as a technical or risk management issue, but as a driver towards any discussion on mergers and acquisitions; the ability to manage BC should also be considered a strategic weapon to reduce the acquisition timeframe and shorten the data center merge, often considered one of the top issues in quick wins and information and communication technology (ICT) budget savings. © 2010 ACM.",,"Banking industry; Business activities; Business continuity; Business continuity planning; Business decisions; Common knowledge; Damaged area; Data centers; Disaster areas; Economic activities; Emergency planning; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Financial service; Governing bodies; Hurricane katrina; Information and Communication Technologies; Key factors; Managerial risks; Natural disasters; Payment transactions; Potential exposure; Public sector; Regulatory considerations; September 11; Strategic weapons; Support technology; Tsunami disaster; US markets; World Trade Center; Competition; Disasters; Economics; Finance; Industry; Information systems; International trade; Laws and legislation; Profitability; Risk analysis; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Technology transfer; Tsunamis; Disaster prevention","Arduini, F.; Bocconi University, Milan, Italy; email: vincenzo.morabito@unibocconi.it",,,00010782,,CACMA,,"English","Commun ACM",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649251077

Old age and long-term use of corticosteroid may be a more reliable risk factor than racial characteristics. Introduction: BRONJ is an increasingly common problem. Most BRONJ occurs following an intravenous administration of bisphosphonate treatment for malignant bone disease and metastatic cancer. As the incidence of BRONJ caused by oral administration of bisphosphonate is quite low, it is believed that this medication is relatively safe and effective in preventing complications of osteoporosis, such as hip or spine fractures. The many known risk factors for BRONJ can be classified as drug-related, local, demographic, and systemic. One demographic and systemic risk factor is race. Most of the case reports of BRONJ present elderly, white women. Methods: In this report, we describe five cases of BRONJ caused by oral administration of bisphosphonate in Asian population. Results: All the patients were female and over 65 years old. Three patients had been prescribed with corticosteroids for rheumatoid arthritis. Conclusion: Irrespective of race, elderly women undergoing steroid therapy have an increased incidence of BRONJ even with oral administration of bisphosphonate. © 2009 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Asian; Jaw; Oral administration of bisphosphonate; Osteonecrosis; Osteoporosis","alendronic acid; antibiotic agent; antihypertensive agent; chlorhexidine; corticosteroid; prednisone; aged; article; Asian; bone biopsy; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; corticosteroid induced osteoporosis; corticosteroid therapy; coxitis; curettage; decortication; drug withdrawal; female; gingiva bleeding; high risk population; histopathology; human; human tissue; hypertension; hypothalamus tumor; jaw osteonecrosis; osteomyelitis; osteoporosis; panoramic radiography; patient referral; periodontitis; priority journal; race; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; senescence; skull radiography; tooth extraction; tooth implantation; tooth pain; total hip prosthesis; treatment outcome; Administration, Oral; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Female; Humans; Jaw Diseases; Osteonecrosis; Radiography, Panoramic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Kim, H.

In the author's view, two fundamental flaws in financial regulation led to the biggest crisis of modern times. The first was to put market evaluations of risk at the heart of financial regulation, through external ratings and risk measures derived from market prices. The essential problem is that market prices may improperly evaluate risk in the presence of market failures. The second flaw was to assume that common standards, such as valueaccounting and risk measures are good and that diversity is bad, thus underestimating the advantages different players have to assume different risks. © Oxford University Press, 2013.","Banking supervision; Market evaluations of risk; Risk absorption; Systemic risk",,"Persaud, A.D.",,"Oxford University Press",,9780199578801,,,"English","Time for a Visible Hand: Lessons from the 2008 World Financ.

Calls are being heard in Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland to cap the size of domestic banks. Is small beautiful? In this policy paper, we first match bailing out cost data to the relative size of banks for a sample of 14 countries and 29 banks. An important observation is that some countries with relatively small banks faced large bailout cost when correlated systemic risk affected many banks. Secondly, we call to the attention that capping the size of banks can have an unintended effect: a lack of credit risk diversification. Risk diversification is needed to reduce the costs of financial distress, which are quite significant in the banking industry. If reducing public bail out costs is the right objective, capping the size of banks is not the best tool. So as to keep large banks that provide highly skilled employment opportunities in a services economy, we discuss four policy options that help to ensure financial stability: independence and accountability of bank supervisors, prompt corrective action mechanisms, burden sharing across countries, and an end to the too-big-to-fail doctrine. © 2010 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"Dermine, J.; Department of Banking and Finance, email: Jean.DERMINE@insead.edu",,,09638008,,,,"English","Financ.

Prior bankruptcies suggest that cascades caused by counterparty risk do not occur, as firms diversify their exposures. Instead, crises tend to be symptomatic of common factors in financial firms' portfolios, which lead to widespread instances of declining asset values and which are often misinterpreted as resulting from fire sales. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A 55-year-old man had diabetes with unilateral rubeosis and macular edema. Three days after receiving intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.1 ml), he developed acute vision loss and change of consciousness. A complete ocular examination, fluorescein angiography, carotid artery Doppler sonography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were performed. Results: Best corrected visual acuity before injection was 6/60 in the left eye. He had underlying left carotid artery stenosis combined with bilateral preproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Three days after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, acute ocular ischemic syndrome occurred. He also suffered from acute stroke, and brain magnetic resonance angiography showed total left internal carotid artery occlusion. The final visual acuity was no light perception in the left eye and 3/6 in the right eye. Conclusions: Patients receiving intravitreal injections of bevacizumab should be evaluated for potential systemic risk factors such as carotid insufficiency, coagulopathy and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

Although increased systemic risk factors in the setting of insulin resistance contribute to this problem, it is likely exacerbated by direct effects of insulin resistance on the arterial wall cells that participate in atherosclerosis. A critical process in the progression of subclinical atherosclerotic lesions to clinically relevant lesions is necrotic breakdown of plaques. Plaque necrosis, which is particularly prominent in the lesions of diabetics, is caused by the combination of macrophage apoptosis and defective phagocytic clearance, or efferocytosis, of the apoptotic macrophages. One cause of macrophage apoptosis in advanced plaques is activation of a proapoptotic branch of the unfolded protein response, which is an endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Macrophages have a functional insulin receptor signaling pathway, and downregulation of this pathway in the setting insulin resistance enhances unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis. Moreover, other aspects of the obesity/insulin- resistance syndrome may adversely affect efferocytosis. These processes may therefore provide an important mechanistic link among insulin resistance, plaque necrosis, and atherothrombotic vascular disease and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to this expanding health problem.","Apoptosis; Atherosclerosis; Diabetes; Insulin resistance; Macrophages","growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; insulin; insulin receptor; apoptosis; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; human; insulin resistance; macrophage; nonhuman; obesity; pathophysiology; priority journal; review; signal transduction; Animals; Apoptosis; Arteries; Atherosclerosis; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Macrophages; Necrosis; Obesity; Receptor, Insulin; Signal Transduction; Syndrome; Thrombosis; Unfolded Protein Response","Tabas, I.; Departments of Medicine, 630 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032, United States; email: iat1@columbia.edu",,,00097330,,CIRUA,"20056946","English","Circ.

Unlike previous financial crisis, one major driver of this crisis is the contagious failures of banks through a network of interbank payments and correlated bank portfolios of financial products. The risk that the failure of a single bank can cause a cascading failure of other connected banks and may potentially bring down the entire banking system (network), is defined as systemic risk. Existing bank risk management research focused on the causes and impacts of systemic risk but largely ignored the monitoring and preventive mechanism. In this study, we developed a network-based algorithm to rank systemic risk of banks and financial products in the bank network. In addition, we extended the network model of banking system developed in previous systemic risk research and adopted this model in the evaluation experiment of our proposed algorithm. This algorithm may provide an effective mechanism for stakeholders in the banking industry to monitor and reduce systemic risk and thereby prevent system-wide breakdown in bank networks.","Contagious bank failure; Network analysis; Ranking algorithm; System risks","Electric network analysis; Finance; Information systems; Information use; Online systems; Risk management; Bank failure; Effective mechanisms; Evaluation experiments; Financial products; Management research; Network-based algorithm; Ranking algorithm; System risk; Risk assessment","Hu, D.; Department of Information Systems, , Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong; email: daninghu@cityu.edu.hk",,"Association for Information Systems",,9780615418988,,,"English","Proc.

The euro zone was taken to be, in effect, a victim of ‘collateral damage’ from the fallout of a crisis manufactured elsewhere. The financial systems of core euro-zone countries were held to be fundamentally different from Anglo-Saxon ones and thereby less vulnerable to systemic risks, although there had been a shift towards more capital market-based financial systems amongst European economies. The core euro-zone countries had not seen house price booms on US or UK levels and associated consumption growth; with greater provision of social housing there was not the same expansion of subprime lending. Nor had European countries run major external deficits-overall the euro zone was in approximate balance, with Germany running a clear surplus, and most of the member countries’ trade was conducted with each other. Indeed, the European Commission (2009, p. 48) recently asserted that ‘Overall, the role of the euro area in global imbalances was negligible until the crisis broke’, rather overlooking the role of Germany’s large current account surplus. © Philip Arestis, Rogério Sobreira and José Luis Oreiro 2011.",,,"Perraton, J.; Department of Economics, United Kingdom",,"Palgrave Macmillan",,9780230306912; 9780230271609,,,"English","An Assess. of the Global Impact of the Financial Crisis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016715145

Today, almost a dozen federal regulatory agencies, numerous self-regulatory organizations, and hundreds of state financial regulatory agencies share responsibility for overseeing the financial services industry. As the nation finds itself in the midst of one of the worst financial crises ever, it has become apparent that the regulatory system is ill-suited to meet the nation’s needs in the 21st century. Several key changes in financial markets and products in recent decades have highlighted significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system. • First, regulators have struggled, and often failed, to mitigate the systemic risks posed by large and interconnected financial conglomerates and to ensure they adequately manage their risks. • Second, regulators have had to address problems in financial markets resulting from the activities of large and sometimes less-regulated market participants-such as nonbank mortgage lenders, hedge funds, and credit rating agencies-some of which play significant roles in today’s financial markets. • Third, the increasing prevalence of new and more complex investment products has challenged regulators and investors, and consumers have faced difficulty understanding new and increasingly complex retail mortgage and credit products. • Fourth, standard setters for accounting and financial regulators have faced growing challenges in ensuring that accounting and audit standards appropriately respond to financial market developments, and in addressing challenges arising from the global convergence of accounting and auditing standards. • Finally, as financial markets have become increasingly global, the current fragmented U.S. regulatory structure has complicated some efforts to coordinate internationally with other regulators. These significant developments have outpaced a fragmented and outdated regulatory structure, and, as a result, significant reforms to the U.S. regulatory system are critically and urgently needed. The current system has significant weaknesses that, if not addressed, will continue to expose the nation’s financial system to serious risks. Our report offers a framework for crafting and evaluating regulatory reform proposals consisting of nine characteristics that should be reflected in any new regulatory system. By applying the elements of the framework, the relative strengths and weaknesses of any reform proposal should be better revealed, and policymakers should be able to focus on identifying tradeoffs and balancing competing goals. Similarly, the framework could be used to craft proposals, or to identify aspects to be added to existing proposals to make them more effective and appropriate for addressing the limitations of the current system.. As the administration and Congress continue to take actions to address the immediate financial crisis, determining how to create a regulatory system that reflects new market realities is a key step to reducing the likelihood that the United States will experience another financial crisis similar to the current one. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781613246108; 9781607415671,,,"English","Financial Regulatory Reform",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016567604

Design/methodology/approach - The empirical analysis focuses on the responses of stock prices of various size groups of banking organizations to announcement of government capital injections to banks (troubled assets relief program) during the 2008 financial crisis, and summarizes responses of regulatory authorities to the crisis. Findings - The paper finds positive and statistically significant stock return reactions both for a portfolio of the large banking organizations that are part of the initial capital injection plan and a portfolio of the large banking organizations that are not part of the initial capital injection plan, implying a too-big-to-fail (TBTF) effect, especially for the latter group of institutions. Research limitations/implications - The paper focuses on a short time frame of stock price reactions to specific events, for the largest US banks. Further examination of longer-term stock price effects on US as well as foreign banks may be of interest. Practical implications - The results have implications for the manner and scope of financial regulatory actions and changes in regulators’ approaches to systemic risk and individual bank regulation. Originality/value - The paper examines TBTF bank subsidy effects in response to a rapidly unfolding financial crisis. These have implications for longer term responses, particularly in the regulatory sphere. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Financial institutions; Stock markets; Subsidies; United states of america",,"Klingenhagen, A.M.; Finance Department, , Chicago, IL, United States; email: aklingen@depaul.edu",,,13581988,,,,"English","J.

The rapid growth of the derivatives market, the potential for widespread credit defaults (such as defaults for subprime mortgages), and operational problems in the over-the-counter (OTC) market where credit default swaps are traded, have led some policymakers to inquire if credit default swaps are a danger to the financial system and the economy. For example, the establishment of a conservatorship for the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in September 2008 potentially triggered credit default swap contracts with notional value exceeding $1.2 trillion.

Banks and other financial institutions channel the economy's savings toward a variety of current productive uses. By borrowing short-term and lending long-term, these institutions create a flow of credit that passes liquidity from savers to investors, and transforms liquid short-run assets into less liquid long-term assets. But lending in credit markets requires confidence in the borrowers' ability to repay the debt (principal and interest) in full and on schedule. The current turmoil in U.S. financial markets is the result of a breakdown in that necessary confidence. In an environment of distrust, financial institutions are far less willing and able to lend long-term.

Our algorithm takes sensor inputs from physical sensors providing system subcomponent performance data and outputs (i) a global systemic risk indicator and (ii) possible diagnosis hypotheses.

Although much of this debate so far has focused on the inter-firm and intra-group dealings among financial firms that the crisis has exposed as sites of systemic risk, the catalytic effects of the insecurities and vulnerabilities experienced by sub-prime borrowers in the US and by Northern Rock savers in the UK has given new prominence to the regulation and governance of personal financial transactions. Responding to the urgency of the perceived need to strengthen consumer confidence in banks, European jurisdictions moved swiftly to shore up depositor compensation funds, increase coverage limits and eliminate co-insurance requirements, apparently with little regard to the moral hazard consequences of such measures. Other consumer-oriented proposals for the new regulatory order include financial product safety regulation, additional information sharing and disclosure measures, further development of responsible lending standards, and the activation of the self-protective capacities of financial consumers through financial education and advice and, where possible, carefully crafted default rules. Many such proposals build on the regulatory foundation that has been laid by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the UK's main market regulator of consumer financial markets and products. Despite operating for most of its short life in an environment that celebrated ‘light-touch’ regulation, the FSA has nonetheless created an innovative model of fair dealing in consumer financial transactions. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,,"Williams, T.; Kent Law SchoolUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511760938; 9780521190534,,,"English","Unconscionability in European Private Financial Transactions: Protecting the Vulnerable",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890722429

However, developments in financial markets, including the bundling and sale of securitized products by a variety of complex institutions, are blurring the line between prudential regulation and securities law. This evolution makes systemic risk increasingly relevant to securities regulation.

We model systemic risk with two main components: a random shock that weakens one or more financial institutions and a transmission mechanism which transmits and possibly exacerbates such negative effects to the rest of the system. Our model could be conceptually represented by a network already described in previous works. In this work we show how is possible to estimate the distribution of losses for the banking system with our model. Additionally, we show how it is possible to separate the distribution of losses into two components: the losses incurred by the initial shock and the losses resulting from the contagion process. Finally, once the distribution is estimated, we can derive standard risk measures for the system as a whole. Another important contribution of this work is that we can follow the evolution of certain risk measures like the expected loss or the CVaR in order to evaluate if the system is becoming more or less risky, in fact, more or less fragile. Additionally, we can decompose the distribution of losses of the whole banking system into the systemic and the contagion elements and we can determine if the system is more prone to experience contagious difficulties during a certain period of time. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Financial contagion; Monte Carlo simulation; Systemic risk",,"Martínez-Jaramillo, S.; Banco de México, Mexico; email: smartin@banxico.org.mx",,"Elsevier",01651889,,JEDCD,,"English","J.

Results 68% of the surgeons considered local steroid injection invasive. 88% of the surgeons obtained verbal consent only. Of these, only 19% recorded the discussion. Almost all the surgeons (96%) explained the desired effects and 26% provided statistical evidence of local steroid injection. About 88% of the surgeons mentioned other drugs included in the injection. Only 13% of them mentioned the dose of the steroid used. 82% and 77% of the surgeons offered alternative treatment options and the right to refuse injection respectively. 85% and 59% of the surgeons discussed local and systemic risks of steroid injection, respectively.

METHODS: Ninety-two eyes of 92 patients with NTG were enrolled in this study. All patients were followed up for more than 2 years of taking topical antiglaucoma medications. Personal history regarding migraine, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, arrhythmia, and family history of glaucoma were collected from the medical records. The survival data were analyzed using regression analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards model. The relationship between the presence of each systemic factor and the effect of reduction of VF progression were evaluated using the life table analysis. RESULTS: The progression of VF damage was significantly associated with IOP (p = 0.020). The eyes with larger IOP reduction showed significantly less VF progression than eyes with smaller IOP reduction both in patients with and without systemic diseases (with systemic diseases p = 0.027, without systemic diseases p = 0.025) and a family history of glaucoma (p = 0.019). In patients with a family history of glaucoma, the rate of VF progression did not show statistically differences between the eyes with larger IOP reduction and those with smaller IOP reduction.

In patients with marked corneal clouding and visual impairment, penetrating keratoplasty may be considered to improve the patient's vision, functional capacity and quality of life. In MPS, glycosaminoglycans mainly accumulate in the corneal stroma and not in Descemet's membrane or the endothelium, therefore deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) may be preferred in these patients over penetrating keratoplasty. Although there are only limited data on the use of DALK in MPS (I and VI) patients, the results are generally favourable. Nonetheless, when deciding on whether to perform keratoplasty in patients with MPS, the risk of general anaesthesia due to potential concomitant cardio-pulmonary problems and cervical spine instability, the potential presence of other ocular manifestations that also impair vision (e.g. glaucoma, retinal degeneration and optic atrophy) and/or complications such as allograft rejection and the risk of re-opacification of the graft, all need to be taken into consideration. Limbal stem cell transplantation, which can be combined with keratoplasty, also holds potential promise in the treatment of these complex cases. A review of the indications, local and systemic risks, techniques of lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty, and the potential of limbal stem cell transplantation is provided in the context of corneal opacity in MPS. © 2010 The Authors.

Accordingly, when a party to a derivative contract goes bankrupt, the counterparty may terminate the contract and seize what it is owed from the debtor's assets. Congress enacted these safe harbors to combat the risk of systemic failure by maintaining liquidity in troubled markets; in doing so, however, they allowed counterparties to engage in opportunistic behavior and inefficiently consume a debtor's limited assets. Because these two consequences may harm the debtor and its creditors, the safe harbors may merely substitute one kind of systemic risk for another. This Note argues that these safe harbors might more effectively combat systemic risk if they did not permit counterparties to terminate derivatives that are more valuable to the debtor. This is likely true of an insurance-like derivative known as the credit default swap (CDS). Just as insurance contracts may not be terminated-because maintaining insurance is crucial both to debtor rehabilitation and creditor protection-certain CDSs should not be eligible for termination under the safe harbors. Narrowing the safe harbors might help eliminate unnecessary costs arising from bankruptcy and thereby better reduce systemic risk. © 2010.",,,"Faubus, B.G.; Duke University School of Law, United States",,,00127086,,,,"English","Duke Law J.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954797074

Rarely, it can occur in the cerebral or splanchnic veins and these are the most frightening manifestations because of their high mortality rate. A third site of rare venous thrombosis is the deep system of the upper extremities that, as for the lower extremity, can be complicated by pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The authors conducted a narrative review focused on clinical manifestations, risk factors, and treatment of rare venous thromboses. Local risk factors such as infections or cancer are frequent in thrombosis of cerebral or portal veins. Upper extremity deep-vein thrombosis is mostly due to local risk factors (catheter- or effort-related). Common systemic risk factors for rare venous thromboses are inherited thrombophilia and oral contraceptive use; chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are closely associated with splanchnic vein thrombosis. In the acute phase rare venous thromboses should be treated conventionally with low-molecular-weight heparin. Use of local or systemic fibrinolysis should be considered in the case of clinical deterioration in spite of adequate anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with vitamin K-antagonists is recommended for 3-6 months after a first episode of rare venous thrombosis. Indefinite anticoagulation is recommended for Budd-Chiari syndrome, recurrent thrombosis or unprovoked thrombosis and permanent risk factors. In conclusion, the progresses made in the last couple of decades in diagnostic imaging and the broadened knowledge of thrombophilic abnormalities improved the recognition of rare venous thromboses and the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. However, the recommendations for treatment mainly derive from observational studies. © Schattauer 2010.","Budd-Chiari syndrome; Cerebral vein thrombosis; Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis; Mesenteric vein thrombosis; Upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis","anticoagulant agent; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant agent; contraceptive agent; vitamin K group; arm; Budd Chiari syndrome; deep vein thrombosis; human; lung embolism; mesenteric vein thrombosis; mortality; observational study; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; pathophysiology; portal vein thrombosis; postthrombosis syndrome; priority journal; rare disease; review; risk assessment; risk factor; vein thrombosis; antagonists and inhibitors; blood flow; brain vein; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; Hematologic Neoplasms; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; splanchnic blood flow; vascularization; Venous Thrombosis; Anticoagulants; Cerebral Veins; Contraceptive Agents; Diagnostic Imaging; Hematologic Neoplasms; Heparin; Humans; Intracranial Thrombosis; Regional Blood Flow; Risk Factors; Splanchnic Circulation; Upper Extremity; Venous Thrombosis; Vitamin K","Martinelli, I.; IRCCS Maggiore Hospital, Mangiagalli and Regina Elena Foundation, University of Milan, Via Pace 9, 20122 Milan, Italy; email: martin@policlinico.mi.it",,"Schattauer GmbH",03406245,,THHAD,"20352171","English","Thromb.

Methods: The study consisted of a retrospective chart review including 80 patients (CRAO 38, CRVO 42). All patients underwent systemic diagnostics including blood pressure measurement, blood cholesterol level, carotid Doppler imaging, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), intraocular pressure measurement, glaucoma history and presence of thrombophilic factors. A systemic medical history was obtained. Results: Systemic hypertension was found in 76.3% CRAO and 75.6% CRVO patients. Abnormal cardiac findings were detected in 61% (CRAO) and 22% (CRVO). Abnormal carotid findings were detected in 44.1% for CRAO and 9.5% for CRVO. Pathological thrombophilic factors were found in boths groups for approximately 15%. Conclusions: TTE and carotid Doppler are important tools in the diagnosis of sources of emboli in patients with CRAO, while for CRVO abnormal findings are revealed by TTE and carotid Doppler less often.

Aims: To study the association of various systemic risk factors with retinal hard exudates in type 2 diabetic north Indian patients and to measure the incidence of dyslipidemia in them. Settings and Design: A tertiary-hospital-based cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: An observational case-study which included 180 type 2 diabetic patients (180 eyes) of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with clinically significant macular edema (CSME). In these patients the retinal hard exudates were graded on a central 500 fundus picture using modified Airlie House classification and divided into three groups of absent or minimal hard exudates (Group 1), hard exudates present (Group 2) and prominent hard exudates (Group 3). Their association with various risk factors, namely the age of onset of diabetes and its duration, gender, insulin therapy, and various systemic parameters like hypertension, blood hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum (s.) creatinine levels, 24-h proteinuria and complete lipid profile including total s. cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and s. triglyceride (TG) was studied. The incidence of dyslipidemia was also calculated among these groups of patients. Statistical Analysis: ANOVA test, linear regression analysis and Spearman′s correlation test. Results: On univariate analysis, the retinal hard exudates were significantly associated with s. creatinine (P=0.016), systolic blood pressure (P=0.014), s. cholesterol (P < 0.001), s. LDL (P=0.008) and s. TG (P=0.013) levels. While on linear regression analysis, s. cholesterol (P < 0.001) and s. LDL cholesterol (P=0.028) were found to be independent risk factors affecting the density of retinal hard exudates. On Spearman′s correlation test, the retinal hard exudates showed a significant positive correlation with systolic blood pressure (P=0.019), s. cholesterol (P < 0.001), LDL (P=0.002) and TG (P=0.014) levels. The incidence of dyslipidemia varied from as high as nearly 70% among patients of Group 3 compared to as low as 18% among Group 1 patients. Conclusion: Serum cholesterol and LDL are independent risk factors for retinal hard exudates in type 2 diabetic north Indian patients who suffer from a remarkably high incidence of dyslipidemia.","Diabetic retinopathy; Hard exudates; Lipid profile","glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; oral antidiabetic agent; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Airlie House classification; article; cholesterol blood level; creatinine blood level; cross-sectional study; diabetic retinopathy; diet therapy; disease association; disease classification; disease severity; dyslipidemia; female; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertension; Indian; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; onset age; proteinuria; retina exudate; risk factor; sex difference; triacylglycerol blood level; Adult; Age of Onset; Aged; Blood Glucose; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Exudates and Transudates; Female; Humans; India; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Photography; Retina; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","Sachdev, N.; Department of Ophthalmology, , Chandigarh, India; email: nishantsachdev777@yahoo.co.in",,,00223859,,JPMDA,"20393241","English","J.

This fragility was further enhanced by a decline in bank liquidity (reliance on wholesale funding) and a shift in govenance from partnerships to limited liability public companies. Some commentators have seen the solution to such pro-cyclicality in the guise of direct constraints on bank activity, such as the promotion of 'narrow banking' or limits on bank size. While there are arguments for toughening regulation as systemic risk increases, direct constraints are simplistic; more sensible ideas involve the adoption of better designed macro-prudential regulation, perhaps with some version of banking self-insurance.

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of thrombophilia among RVO patients with and without systemic risk factors and among patients younger and older than 50 years. Design: Prospective case-control study. Participants: One hundred and twenty one patients with RVO, including 92 with acquired risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus) and 29 without these factors. The control group included 60 persons matched for age, sex, and risk factors. Methods: All participants were screened for Leiden mutation (FV Leiden), hyperprothrombinemia (20210 G/A mutation) and deficiency of protein C, S, and antithrombin. Results: The prevalence of FV Leiden was significantly higher among RVO patients without risk factors (24.1%) than among controls without risk factors (0%; p = 0.034) and among RVO patients with acquired disorders (4.3%; p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in the prevalence of the other investigated thrombophilic factors. In all, 37.9% patients without acquired risk factors were positive for at least 1 thrombophilic factor compared with 7.6% RVO patients with acquired risk factors (p < 0.001) and 8.3% of the controls (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of thrombophilic disorders among RVO patients according to age. Conclusions: FV Leiden is significantly more frequent among RVO patients without acquired risk factors. Thrombophilia plays a much more important role in the pathogenesis of RVO in patients without acquired risk factors. Screening for thrombophilia is thus indicated only for patients in whom these factors have been excluded.","Leiden mutation; Retinal vein occlusion; Risk factors; Thrombophilia","antithrombin; blood clotting factor 5 Leiden; protein C; protein S; prothrombin; adult; aged; article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; major clinical study; male; pathogenesis; prevalence; protein S deficiency; retina vein occlusion; risk factor; thrombophilia","Rehak, J.; Department of Ophthalmology, I.P.

It is most often associated with anabolic steroid use, weight lifting, and laceration. Other local and systemic risk factors include local steroid injection, olecranon bursitis, and hyperparathyroidism. Distal triceps rupture is usually caused by a fall on an outstretched hand or a direct blow. Eccentric loading of a contracting triceps has been implicated, particularly in professional athletes. Initial diagnosis may be difficult because a palpable defect is not always present. Pain and swelling may limit the ability to evaluate strength and elbow range of motion. Although plain radiographs are helpful in ruling out other elbow pathology, MRI is used to confirm the diagnosis, classify the injury, and guide management. Incomplete tears with active elbow extension against resistance are managed nonsurgically. Surgical repair is indicated in active persons with complete tears and for incomplete tears with concomitant loss of strength. Good to excellent results have been reported with surgical repair, and very good results have been achieved even for chronic tears.

Radiofrequency (RF) analysis of intravascular ultrasound [IVUS, Virtual histology™ (VH)] offers a unique tool to study the composition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. We used data from the multicentre VH registry to assess the association between cardiovascular risk factors and coronary plaque volume and composition.Methods and resultsBetween August 2004 and July 2006, 990 patients in 42 centres were enrolled in a prospective, multicentre, non-randomized global VH registry. Coronary artery imaging was performed by conventional IVUS and RF-IVUS. The four RF-IVUS plaque components [dense calcium (DC), necrotic core (NC), fibrous (F) tissue, and fibro fatty (FF)] were analysed in every recorded frame. The results were expressed as mean cross-sectional areas, absolute volume, and percentage of total plaque volume. Risk factor assessment included evaluation of family history of previous myocardial infarction (MI), past or current smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and the laboratory measurements. Patients with diabetes had an increased relative proportion of NC (6.47 ± 0.28 vs. 5.86 ± 0.14, P = 0.037) and DC (4.58 ± 0.27 vs. 3.90 ± 0.14, P = 0.017), and patients with hypertension had an increased relative proportion of FF, DC (4.35 ± 0.16 vs. 3.57 ± 0.17, P = 0.02) and NC (6.24 ± 0.17 vs. 5.60 ± 0.19, P = 0.01). Compared with patients with LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL, patients with LDL-C &gt;160 mg/dL had higher plaque volume (342.1 ± 26.2 vs. 318.6 ± 10.7 mm3). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between the level of HDL-C and F (r =-0.149, P &lt; 0.01), FF (r =-0.106, P &lt; 0.01), and NC (r =-0.90, P &lt; 0.05). The level of LDL correlated with F (r = 0.110, P &lt; 0.01). Patients with prior MI have an increased percentage of F (30.03 ± 0.59 vs. 28.20 ± 0.37, P = 0.009). Smoking had no relevant effect on plaque composition. Treatment with acetylsalicylacid and statins reduced FF with altering plaque volume.ConclusionRadiofrequency-IVUS detects marked differences in coronary plaque composition related to the risk factor profile with particular focus on lipid levels. Greater amounts of NC were associated with diabetes, hypertension, MI, and low HDL-C. The effects of treatment of changes related to plaque composition are underway.","Intravascular ultrasound; Plaque composition; Radiofrequency; Risk factors; Virtual histology","acetylsalicylic acid; fatty acid; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; adult; aged; article; atherosclerotic plaque; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; correlational study; data analysis; diabetes mellitus; evaluation; family history; female; heart infarction; histology; human; hypertension; in vivo study; intravascular ultrasound; linear regression analysis; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prospective study; protein expression; radiofrequency; register; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; Aged; Aspirin; Coronary Artery Bypass; Coronary Artery Disease; Diabetic Angiopathies; Dyslipidemias; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Pedigree; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Prospective Studies; Registries; Risk Factors; Smoking; Ultrasonography, Interventional; User-Computer Interface","Philipp, S.; Department of Cardiology, Hufelandstr. 55, D-45122 Essen, Germany; email: sebastian.philipp@uk-essen.de",,,0195668X,,EHJOD,"19854730","English","Eur.

I consider two different motives for outside investors and their interaction with banks trading asset-backed securities: uncertainty aversion versus adverse selection. I shall argue that the version with uncertainty averse investors is more consistent with the stylized facts than the adverse selection perspective: in the former, the crisis deepens, the larger the market share of distressed core banks, while a run becomes less likely instead as a result in the adverse selection version. Therefore, the outright purchase of troubled assets by the government at prices above current market prices may both alleviate the financial crises as well as provide tax payers with returns above those for safe securities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Distinct endothelial phenotypes correlate with regional hemodynamics. We propose that systemic risk factors modify regional endothelial phenotype to influence focal susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Transcript profiles of freshly isolated endothelial cells from three atherosusceptible and three atheroprotected arterial regions in adult swine were analyzed to determine the initial prelesional effects of hypercholesterolemia on endothelial phenotypes in vivo. Cholesterol efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) was upregulated at all sites in response to short-term high-fat diet. Proinflammatory and antioxidative endothelial gene expression profiles were induced in atherosusceptible and atheroprotected regions, respectively. However, markers for endoplasmic reticulum stress, a signature of susceptible endothelial phenotype, were not further enhanced by brief hypercholesterolemia. Both region-specific and ubiquitous (ABCA1) phenotype changes were identified as early prelesional responses of the endothelium to hypercholesterolemia.

However, compared to the large body of literature on international equity market linkages, there are far fewer empirical studies of bond systemic risk or international bond market co-movements. The extent of international bond market linkages merits investigation, as it may have important implications for the cost of financing fiscal deficit, monetary policymaking independence, modelling and forecasting long-term interest rates, and bond portfolio diversification. In this paper, we investigate the relative influence of systemic and idiosyncratic risk factors on yield spreads over 10-year German government securities during the seven years after the beginning of Monetary Integration. We estimate both panel regressions for the two groups of EU-15 countries (EMU and non-EMU) and specific-country regressions for the nine countries in the EMU group and the three countries in the non-EMU group. All estimations include both domestic (differences in market liquidity and credit risk) and international risk factors. The results present clear evidence that it was mostly idiosyncratic rather than systemic risk factors that drove the evolution of 10-year yield spread differentials over Germany in all EMU countries during the seven years after the beginning of Monetary Integration. Conversely, in the case of non-EMU countries, adjusted yield spreads (corrected from the foreign exchange factor) are influenced more by systemic risk factors. The fact that these countries do not share a common Monetary Policy might explain these results, which may show that government bonds from EMU countries have a better safe-haven status that those of non-EMU countries. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Monetary integration; Sovereign debt markets; Systemic and idiosyncratic risk",,"Gómez-Puig, M.; Economic Theory Department, Av.

However, there are several risks associated with outsourcing and the traditional approach until recently has been to address these risks individually. Most organizations involved in outsourcing identify the risks and have plans in place on how to mitigate these risks if they were to occur individually. However, this approach is not sufficient because it does not deliver the expected value from the outsourcing projects.

We compare the crisis with other episodes in the United States, in particular, the panic of 1907, the failure of Continental Illinois and the Savings and Loan crisis. We conclude that several principal imperfections, in particular, distortions induced by regulation and government guarantees, developed in decades preceding the current one, allowing LCFIs to take on excessive systemic risk. We also examine alternative explanations for the financial crisis. We conclude that while moral hazard problems in the originate-and-distribute model of banking, excess liquidity due to global imbalances and mispricing of risk due to behavioral biases have some merit as candidates, they fail to explain the complete spectrum of evidence on the crisis. © 2010 V.

Second they must respond in a timely fashion to future unsustainable expansions of credit and growth of asset prices. These are old policy challenges.

The factors were chosen from a wide range of accounting and market-based indicators, but also macroeconomic and financial development data, using a stepwise procedure. The study finds that financial development is one of the significant determinants of return co-movement but that the share of interbank activities in the balance sheet is not a significant factor. A strong link is found between the bank return co-movements and bank default risk measured by a z-score.

We tested for the significance of macroeconomic and banking sector variables that condition non-performing loan ratios and the hypothesis of procyclicality between economic activity and improving banking-sector results in the Baltic States, Bulgaria and Romania. The theory of procyclicality between economic activity and the non-performing loan ratio was proven. The increased economic activity improved the loan portfolio quality of the banking sector, as indicated by a lower NPL ratio. Due to a high share of loans denominated in a foreign currency and the fact of productivity gains in the tradable sector, the appreciation of the real exchange rate contributed to an improvement in loan portfolio quality. The procyclicality of banking sector performance and high economic activities growth could be a signal of an economy overheating and therefore a slowdown in economic activity is likely to accelerate the growth of the non-performing loan ratio in the Baltic States, Bulgaria and Romania.","Asset quality; Cyclically; Economic growth; Non-performing loans; Systemic risk",,"Festić, M.; University of Maribor, , Ljubljana, Slovenia; email: mejra.festic@eipf.si",,,16111699,,,,"English","J.

At a high level we address the basic functional and non-functional requirements of data and analytics posed by a hypothetical systemic risk regulator. To make our discussion concrete, we will explore the problem of systemic risk management in the residential mortgage markets of the United States.

IKE recognizes that policy officials and market participants must cope with ever-imperfect knowledge of the causal mechanism driving market outcomes. In our IKE-based model of asset markets, price swings arise from participants' diverse interpretations of the effects of fundamentals on outcomes. Under IKE, the market is an imperfect mechanism for setting values. However, the paper argues that, within a range of prices, the market's allocation is superior to the allocation that would result if the state actively intervened into the price-setting mechanism. During periods of non-excessive prices, swings play an indispensible role in helping society to allocate scarce capital and the state should confine its intervention to setting the rules of the game, that is, ensuring transparency and eliminating other market failures. However, price swings can sometimes move far from levels consistent with most perceptions of longer-term fundamental values. If they do, the IKE approach calls for active intervention to dampen excessive movements. The paper proposes the use of official ""guidance ranges"" and discusses problems with their estimation. It also proposes an array of other excess-countering measures and concludes with ideas on how regulators can better measure and manage systemic risk in the financial system.

Research Design and Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of 203 adult Black and Latino diabetic patients from the King-Drew Medical Center eye clinic from January 1998 to March 2005. Systemic risk factors such as HbA1c and kidney function data were collected. FP and FA were analyzed and graded according to Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. Statistical analysis was performed to determine whether a given lesion type was more characteristic of a particular racial group. Results: Gender, age, median microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and average HbA1c values were not significantly different between the groups. The presence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME), focal or diffuse, was very high in both groups (44% in Latinos and 46% in Blacks), and the overall DR grades were similar. However, upon individual lesion analysis, the Latinos were noted to have more prevalent intraretinal hemorrhages involving a greater area of the retina (P=.046). Conclusions: Although Latinos and Blacks of comparable age and glycemic control are equally at risk for CSME and proliferative retinopathy, Latinos may be at greater risk for a specific phenotype of DR characterized by extravasation of intraretinal hemorrhages, which is associated with poor prognosis. Further prospective studies may uncover racial differences that may have implications for prognosis and therapy.","Black; Diabetic retinopathy phenotype; Latino","albumin; creatinine; hemoglobin A1c; adult; African American; age distribution; aged; article; controlled study; creatinine urine level; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; eye fundus; eye photography; female; fluorescence angiography; hemoglobin blood level; Hispanic; human; image analysis; major clinical study; male; medical record review; Negro; priority journal; proliferative retinopathy; race difference; retina hemorrhage; retina macula edema; risk assessment; risk factor; scoring system; sex difference; urine level; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Los Angeles; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Prevalence; Retinal Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies","Sarraf, D.; Department of Ophthalmology, , Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: dsarraf@ucla.edu",,,10568727,,JDICE,"18599323","English","J.

In order to produce better integrated risk assessment for banks and systemic risk assessments for financial systems, we argue that reasonably detailed modeling of bank asset and liability structures, loan portfolio credit quality, and loan concentrations by sector, region and type, as well as a number of financial and economic environment risk drivers, is required. Sovereign and inter-bank default risks are increasingly important in the current economic environment and their inclusion is an important model extension. This extended model is demonstrated through an application to both individual Brazilian banks (i.e., 28 of the largest banks) and groups of banks (i.e., the Brazilian banking system) as of December 2004. When omitting Sovereign risk, our analysis indicates that none of the banks face significant default risk over a 1-year horizon. This low default risk stems primarily from the large amount of government securities held by Brazilian banks, but also reflects the banks' adequate capitalizations and extraordinarily high interest rate spreads. We note that none of the banks which we modeled failed during the very stressful 2007-2008 period, consistent with our results. Our results also show that a commonly used approach of aggregating all banks into one single bank, for purposes of undertaking a systemic banking system risk assessment, results in a misestimate of both the probability and the cost of systemic banking system failures. Once Sovereign risk is considered and losses in the market value of government securities reach 10% (or higher), we find that several banks could fail during the same time period. These results demonstrate the well known risk of concentrated lending to a borrower, or type of borrower, which has a non-zero probability of default (e.g., the Government of Brazil). Our analysis also indicates that, in the event of a Sovereign default, the Government of Brazil would face constrained debt management alternatives. To the best of our knowledge no one else has put forward a systematic methodology for assessing bank asset, liability, loan portfolio structure and correlated market and credit (private sector, Sovereign, and inter-bank) default risk for banks and banking systems. We conclude that such forward-looking risk assessment methodologies for assessing multiple correlated risks, combined with the targeted collection of specific types of data on bank portfolios, have the potential to better quantify overall bank and banking system risk levels, which can assist bank management, bank regulators, Sovereigns, rating agencies, and investors to make better informed and proactive risk management and investment decisions. © 2009 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"Barnhill Jr., T.

IMF points out weak governance structures as one of the main causes for financial/economical crisis. However, research in this area is still limited. One of the reasons is the inherent complexity of the public sector governance notion. In this research, the regulatory governance of the financial sector is conceived as a complex system, in which governance is perceived as a phenomenon resulting from the interactions among all the actors that influence or are influenced by regulatory activities within the financial sector. An agent-based simulation was developed to analyze and evaluate the emergent behaviors from the governance in the Brazilian finance sector under different macroeconomics variables and different attitudes, perceptions and desires of economic and political actors. The agent-based model is combined with an econometric model, which is intended to characterize the macroeconomic environment. The regulatory environment is modeled by computational agents using BDI (beliefs-desires-intentions) architecture. The agents have beliefs about their environment and desires they want to satisfy, thus leading them to create intentions to act.

Methods: A total of 10,890 participants (aged 50-92) who underwent a health check-up at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from January to December 2006 were included. Fundus photographs and systemic risk factors were assessed. Subtype frequencies of neovascular AMD were recorded according to angiograms. AMD was defined in accord with the international classification and grading system. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AMD. Results: The mean age of the 10,890 participants was 57.2 ± 6.3 years (50-92 years), and 56.2% were men. The age-gender-adjusted prevalence of early AMD was 5.07%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR per 10-year increment, 2.22) and high blood pressure (adjusted OR: 1.35) were independent risk factors for early AMD. The age-gender-adjusted prevalence of late AMD was 0.34%. Only age was significantly associated with late AMD. Of 9 exudative AMD patients who received fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography, 6 eyes (66.7%) showed choroidal neovascularization, 2 eyes (22.2%) had polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and 1 eye (11.1%) had retinal angiomatous proliferation. Conclusion: In this study, the prevalence of early AMD was similar to other studies though the prevalence of late AMD was low. High blood pressure as well as age was a risk factor of early AMD. South Koreans may have a higher prevalence of PCV than white populations. These findings provide preliminary information for further investigation of AMD in South Koreans. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Age-related macular degeneration; Prevalence; Risk factors; South Koreans; Subtype","adult; aged; article; controlled study; disease classification; female; fluorescence angiography; human; hypertension; indocyanine green angiography; major clinical study; male; ophthalmoscopy; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; prevalence; priority journal; retina disease; retina macula age related degeneration; risk factor; sex difference; South Korea; subretinal neovascularization; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Republic of Korea; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution","Yu, H.

The subprime mortgage crisis currently happening in the USA is a typical example. In order to further deepen our understanding of how crisis contagion occurs and enhance information interchange and knowledge sharing among related entities, ontologies for crisis contagion management in financial institutions are proposed in this study. Three categories of ontologies, which include static ontology, dynamic ontology, and social ontology, are developed to deal with different perspectives in this domain. The three types of ontology are then united in the Ontology Web Language (OWL) and the Semantic Web Rules Languages (SWRL) framework, both of which are machine readable.

In particular, models of social and financial cascades, as well as the fiber bundle model, the voter model, and models of epidemic spreading are recovered as special cases. To unify their description, we define the net fragility of a node, which is the difference between its fragility and the threshold that determines its failure. Nodes fail if their net fragility grows above zero and their failure increases the fragility of neighbouring nodes, thus possibly triggering a cascade. In this framework, we identify three classes depending on the way the fragility of a node is increased by the failure of a neighbour. At the microscopic level, we illustrate with specific examples how the failure spreading pattern varies with the node triggering the cascade, depending on its position in the network and its degree. At the macroscopic level, systemic risk is measured as the final fraction of failed nodes, X*, and for each of the three classes we derive a recursive equation to compute its value. The phase diagram of X* as a function of the initial conditions, thus allows for a prediction of the systemic risk as well as a comparison of the three different model classes. We could identify which model class leads to a first-order phase transition in systemic risk, i.e. situations where small changes in the initial conditions determine a global failure. Eventually, we generalize our framework to encompass stochastic contagion models. This indicates the potential for further generalizations. © EDP Sciences, Societa Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2009.",,"Epidemic spreading; Failed nodes; Fiber bundle models; First-order phase transitions; Global failure; Initial conditions; Macroscopic levels; Microscopic levels; Neighbouring nodes; Processes on networks; Recursive equations; Voter models; Phase diagrams; Stochastic models","Lorenza, J.; ETH Zürich, Kreuzplatz 5, 8032 Zürich, Switzerland; email: jalorenz@ethz.ch",,,14346028,,,,"English","Eur.

We show that such a defined model leads to phase transition, which results in collective defaults. The existence of the collective phase depends on the mean interaction strength. For small interaction strength parameters, there are many independent bankruptcies of individual companies. For large parameters, there are giant collective defaults of firm clusters. In the case when the individual firm dynamics favors dumping of rating changes, there is an optimal strength of the firm's interactions from the systemic risk point of view. © EDP Sciences, Societa Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2009.",,"Economic development; Firm dynamics; Interaction strength; Two sources; Dynamics; Rating; Industry","Sieczka, P.; Faculty of Physics, Koszykowa 75, 00-662 Warsaw, Poland; email: psieczka@if.pw.edu.pl",,,14346028,,,,"English","Eur.

In a simple currencychoice portfolio model, we show that a strategy of reducing dollarization, if it fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks, leads to higher domestic real interest rates. We confirm this prediction in an empirical panel-based model, involving systemic risk variables, but find that the effect is small after controlling for the risks of dilution and default. We apply our empirical estimates to the case of Brazil - a natural case study given its low degree of financial dollarization and very high real interest rates. The estimated model is unable to explain the high interest rate levels in the aftermath of Brazil's 1994 inflation stabilization. However, since the adoption in 1999 of inflation targeting and floating exchange rates, Brazil's real interest rates are found to be gradually converging to the model's predicted values. The estimation also shows that further reductions in Brazil's real interest rates could be achieved through sound fundamentals that led to investment-grade status rather than financial dollarization.","Brazil; Emerging markets; Financial dollarization; Interest rates; Panel data",,"Holland, M.; IEPE, Brazil; email: marcio.holland@fgv.br",,,00347140,,,,"English","Rev.

It is believed that such stimuli result in a spatially variable biomechanical stress distribution, which has been implicated as a key modulator of remodeling associated with atherosclerotic lesion localization. In this study we utilized a combined ex vivo experimental/computational methodology to address the hypothesis that local variations in shear and mural stress associated with cyclic flexure influence the distribution of early markers of atherogenesis. Bilateral porcine femoral arteries were surgically harvested and perfused ex vivo under pulsatile arterial conditions. One of the paired vessels was exposed to cyclic flexure (0-0.7 cm-1) at 1 Hz for 12 h. During the last hour, the perfusate was supplemented with Evan's blue dye-labeled albumin. A custom tissue processing protocol was used to determine the spatial distribution of endothelial permeability, apoptosis, and proliferation. Finite element and computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to determine the mural and shear stress distributions, respectively, for each perfused segment. Biological data obtained experimentally and mechanical stress data estimated computationally were combined in an experiment-specific manner using multiple linear regression analyses. Arterial segments exposed to cyclic flexure had significant increases in intimal and medial apoptosis (3.42 ± 1.02 fold, p = 0.029) with concomitant increases in permeability (1.14 ± 0.04 fold, p = 0.026). Regression analyses revealed specific mural stress measures including circumferential stress at systole, and longitudinal pulse stress were quantitatively correlated with the distribution of permeability and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that local variation in mechanical stress in arterial segments subjected to cyclic flexure indeed influence the extent and spatial distribution of the early atherogenic markers. In addition, the importance of including mural stresses in the investigation of vascular mechanopathobiology was highlighted. Specific example results were used to describe a potential mechanism by which systemic risk factors can lead to a heterogeneous disease.

Although intravitreal ranibizumab did not result in substantial improvement (15 or more letters on an ETDRs chart) in the majority of cases treated in the MARINA (Minimally classic/occult trial of the Anti-VEGF antibody Ranibizumab in the treatment of Neovascular AMD) or ANCHOR (Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic CHORoidal Neovascularization in AMD) trials, few cases experienced substantial visual acuity loss. The most serious known risk of treatment, endophthalmitis, although rare, is always a possibility. Intravitreal bevacizumab might be considered when ranibizumab is not available because of regulatory or financial constraints, and it might be considered in place of ranibizumab even without financial constraints if noninferiority trials show that bevacizumab is almost as good as-or is better than-ranibizumab. Systemic risks of intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab are unknown, although trials have ruled out moderate or large systemic risks for ranibizumab. This therapy should be considered when initiating therapy for lesions that are subfoveal, and predominantly CNV when the lesion composition on fluorescein angiography (FA) is predominantly classic, or when there is presumed recent disease progression and the lesion composition is minimally classic or occult with no classic. Optical coherence tomography, FA, or both also might be of value to assist with decisions regarding continuation of treatment after it has been initiated. However, to date, there is little consistent information to suggest that utilizing these imaging modalities to consider withholding treatment before 2 years has been shown confidently to result in outcomes as good as monthly treatment. Extrapolation of these recommendations should be done with caution when considering the treatment of subfoveal CNV that is not predominantly CNV, such as predominantly blood lesions or lesions that are predominantly scar, as well as lesions associated with very low levels of visual acuity or those owing to causes other than AMD. A subsequent review in this series discusses other therapies for CNV being considered in the future.

The limited liability of banks and the presence of a negative externality of one bank's failure on the health of other banks give rise to a systemic risk-shifting incentive where all banks undertake correlated investments, thereby increasing economy-wide aggregate risk. Regulatory mechanisms such as bank closure policy and capital adequacy requirements that are commonly based only on a bank's own risk fail to mitigate aggregate risk-shifting incentives, and can, in fact, accentuate systemic risk. Prudential regulation is shown to operate at a collective level, regulating each bank as a function of both its joint (correlated) risk with other banks as well as its individual (bank-specific) risk. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Proposed federal legislation would man-date ""say on pay"" generally for U.S. public companies. This Article assesses the case for such a mandatory federal rule in light of the U.K. experience with a similar regime adopted in 2002. The best argument for a mandatory rule is that it would destabilize pay practices that have produced excessive compensation and that would not yield to firm-by-firm pressure. This has not been the U.K. experience; pay continues to increase. The most serious concern is the likely evolution of a ""best compensation practices"" regime which would embed nor-matively-opinionated practices that would ill-suit many firms. There is some evi-dence of a U.K. evolution in that direction. This problem might be more pronounced in the U.S. because shareholders are even more likely than their U.K. counterparts to delegate judgments over compensation practices to a small number of proxy advisors who themselves will be economizing on analysis. The Article argues instead for a federally provided shareholder opt-in right to a ""say on pay"" regime, which would change the present reliance on precatory propos-als in the issuer proxy, which are in turn subject to the power delegated to shareholders under state law. Secondarily, the Article argues that any mandatory regime should be limited to the 500 largest public companies by pub-lic market float and should not cover the more than 12,000 firms subject to SEC oversight. Compensation practices at key financial firms present a distinct set of safety and soundness issues because of potential systemic risk from a failure of such firms.

Psychophysical test of contrast sensitivity (CS) was used for the detection of these changes. Relation between CS and systemic risk factors (HbAlc, blood pressure (BP), serum lipids and BMI) were also evaluated during a follow-up time. There were 48 recent diabetics without DR included in this study that were examined 3 times and compared to 23 diabetics with mild DR. The CS tests were performed using both Sine Wave Contrast Test (SWCT) and Pelli-Robson (PR) test. The reference values for CS threshold were derived from a CS of a control group of 52 healthy individuals. Abnormal CS ascertained by both methods, SWCT and PR, was observed in diabetics with mild NPDR. In comparison to the control group, there was a statistically significant difference of CS in spatial frequencies (SF) of 1.5,6,12,18 cycles per degree (cy/deg). In comparison to diabetics without DR there was a significant difference of CS in SF of 6,12 and 18 cy/deg in diabetics with mild NPDR. Abnormal CS was noticed in 47.8% (SWCT) or 21.7% (PR) of diabetics with DR. Statistically significant influence of high systolic BP on CS values and visual acuity was noticed.There were no abnormalities in CS in patients without DR comparing to control group during the whole follow-up. However, there was an improvement of CS in SF of 18 cy/deg observed between 1. and 3. evaluation of CS. Interaction of change in values of HbA1c and total cholesterol to HDL ratio had significant influence on CS improvement. Diabetics without DR had significantly better diabetes and blood pressure control in comparison to the diabetics with DR. In conclusion, it was not proved in this study that CS test is suitable for the screening for DR or early functional defects in neural retina before clinical manifestation of DR. Early diagnosis of DM and good compensation of diabetes, blood pressure and serum lipids level can postpone the onset of DR as well as the visual functions impairments.","2. type diabetics; Contrast sensitivity; Diabetic retinopathy; Neural retina; Systemic risk factors","glycosylated hemoglobin; article; blood; contrast sensitivity; diabetic retinopathy; female; human; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; Contrast Sensitivity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Male; Middle Aged","Beszédešová, N.; Klinika nemocí očních a optometrie LF MU, Pekařská 53, 656 91 Brno, Czech Republic; email: natalia.beszedesova@gmail.com",,,12119059,,CSOFF,"19750829","Slovak","Ceska Slov.

The first half of the paper explains the role of mortgage securitization as a mechanism for allocating risks from real estate investments and discusses what has gone wrong and why in the implementation of this mechanism in the United States. The second half of the paper discusses the incidence of systemic risk in the crisis. Two elements of systemic risk are identified. First, there was excessive maturity transformation through conduits and structured-investment vehicles (SIVs); when this broke down in August 2007, the overhang of asset-backed securities that had been held by these vehicles put significant additional downward pressure on securities prices. Second, as the financial system adjusted to the recognition of delinquencies and defaults in US mortgages and to the breakdown of maturity transformation of conduits and SIVs, the interplay of market malfunctioning or even breakdown, fair value accounting and the insufficiency of equity capital at financial institutions, and, finally, systemic effects of prudential regulation created a detrimental downward spiral in the overall financial system. The paper argues that these developments have not only been caused by identifiably faulty decisions, but also by flaws in financial system architecture. In thinking about regulatory reform, one must therefore go beyond considerations of individual incentives and supervision and pay attention to issues of systemic interdependence and transparency.","Banking regulation; Capital requirements; Mortgage securitization; Subprime-mortgage financial crisis; Systemic risk","banking; capital; financial crisis; financial system; mortgage lending; regulatory framework; risk assessment; North America; United States","Hellwig, M.F.; Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, Kurt Schumacher Strasse 10, 53113 Bonn, Germany; email: hellwig@coll.mpg.de",,,0013063X,,ECNMA,,"English","Economist (NLD)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-68349139435

Even though age is the major determinant for developing AMD, clinical studies have revealed hypertension (HTN) as another systemic risk factor. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is considered the most important hormone associated with HTN. To evaluate the relationship of Ang II to AMD, we studied whether mouse RPE expresses functional Ang II receptor subtypes and whether HTN-induced Ang II regulates expression of these receptors as well as critical ECM molecules (MMP-2 and type IV collagen) involved in ECM turnover in RPE. We used 9-month-old C57BL/6 male mice infused with Ang II alone or Ang II in combination with the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan or the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 for 4 weeks to determine whether HTN-associated Ang II was important for ECM regulation in RPE. We found that mouse RPE expressed both Ang II receptor subtypes at the mRNA and protein levels. Infusion with Ang II induced HTN and elevated plasma and ocular Ang II levels. Ang II also regulated AT1a and AT1b receptor mRNA expression, the intracellular concentration of calcium [Ca2+]i, MMP-2 activity, and type IV collagen accumulation. Concurrent administration of Ang II with the AT1 receptor blocker prevented the increase in blood pressure and rise in ocular Ang II levels, as well as the calcium and MMP-2 responses. In contrast, the type IV collagen response to Ang II was prevented by blockade of AT2 receptors, but not AT1 receptors. Plasma Ang II levels were not modified by the AT1 or AT2 receptor blockade. Since the effects of Ang II on MMP-2 and type IV collagen require inhibition of both Ang II receptor subtypes, these receptors may play a role as a potential therapeutic targets to prevent ECM turnover dysregulation in the RPE basement membrane, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism to explain the link between HTN and AMD. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of these involve financial agents acting on behalf of source-investors. Such a financial-agent network can be found in the venture capital sector. It has been understood that the institutional funds that invest in Venture Capital firms (""VCs"") can diversify their financial portfolio risk by investing in several VCs. But the adverse scenario remains that an institutional fund invests in more than one VC, which chooses, via syndication, to invest in the same venture. This creates less diversification than expected. The result is inadvertent systemic risk for the institutional fund. A random sampling model is developed to explore this network scenario; encompassing both the source and destination of VCs' funds. The study uses a data set of 20 UK-based VCs and 73 institutional funds, making a total of 218 investments in VCs, in the period 1993-2003. The findings reject the view that institutional funds investing in multiple VCs tend to do so such that risk is minimised via diversification; the observed pattern of relationships is worse-than-random.

The impact on liquidity buffers and the probability of a liquidity shortfall is simulated by a Monte Carlo approach. An application to Dutch banks illustrates that the second-round effects in specific scenarios could have more impact than the first-round effects and hit all types of banks, indicative of systemic risk. This lends support policy initiatives to enhance banks' liquidity buffers and liquidity risk management, which could also contribute to prevent financial stability risks.

Market players and researchers have tried to find a proxy for it, notably by means of spreads in high yielding markets like credit or emerging markets. However, these measures might be biased because they hinge on series of prices that include market movements due to the re-pricing of both systemic and specific risks. Being macro factors that affect all the assets in the universe, risk appetite and risk aversion can only produce systemic risk re-pricing. We apply a methodology to correct this bias. We analysed emerging market debt capital markets and compute a systemic risk only indicator that enables one to ascertain more precisely periods in which risk appetite might have driven market returns. We find that from the end of 1997 to 2004 only about 30 per cent of the return of the EMBI+ might have been due to changes in risk appetite. © Journal compilation © 2009 University of Adelaide and Flinders University and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",,,"Dupuy, P.; Halbis Capital Management, 4 place de la Pyramide, 75419 Paris cedex 08, France; email: philippe.dupuy@cegetel.net",,,0004900X,,,,"English","Aust.

The power of a single book to cause a paradigm change is brought out as the authors sensemake the field experience in the light of their reading of The Development Dictionary, edited by Wolfgang Sachs, which debunks the myth of a “First World” and a “Third World” based on the socially constructed binary paradigm of “development” and “underdevelopment.” While claiming to do the opposite, professionals in the field of “international development” have often been impoverishing global communities through Western economic and technological interventions, enabled by the “aid” provided by interested global financial institutions on usurious, harmful, and coercive terms. It is ironic that the West, with all its economic crashes, corporate scandals, addictive consumerism, runaway militarism, and unsustainable life styles, considers itself competent to “develop” the other three-fourths of the world's population. A crucial shortcoming of disciplines like Western management, business administration, public policy, and development economics is that their conceptual frameworks and the ensuing strategies ignore the inner, subjective landscape of human beings that can be a source of creative transcendence from the standpoint of human flourishing. As a basis for an enlightened consciousness in global social change work, the paper recommends an alternative conceptual framework defined by the four coordinates of man-as-subject with a focus on the person (as opposed to man-as-object with a focus on aggregates), an abundance-based appreciative valuing (as opposed to a scarcity-based problem solving), organic, indigenous approaches that are grassroots-based (versus expert-driven prescriptions grafted from a foreign source) and an orientation toward Being (rather than a focus on “doing” that results in the mechanistic implementation of programmatic routines). The paper seeks to highlight the importance of resurrecting human subjectivity as a fundamental regenerative force underlying empowerment and poverty alleviation. The answer to the world's problems may be ‘counter-development,’ by which the ‘rich’ ‘developed’ countries “develop” themselves in their spiritual consciousness, thereby reducing the systemic risk of their unsustainable, wasteful ways on the rest of the world they seek to ‘develop.’ If we think of the world as a global learning community, a repository of different ways of living and being that are non-comparable, we may have to remake these contemporary development institutions more in the image of a ‘global parliament of cultures’ in which different cultures, from a stance of equality, share life furthering practices with one another and seek to understand what gives vitality to all of them. As experiences of urban poor groups illustrate, the poor have demonstrated extraordinary creativity and ingenuity in designing innovative solutions to their own problems, and they appear more competent at poverty reduction than local or national governments and international agencies (Appadurai, 2001). Poverty alleviation led by the poor themselves may be a viable alternative to poverty alleviation led by the rich. International development agencies from wealthy countries that claim to be focused on “poverty alleviation” should perhaps reframe their mission to “greed alleviation” in their own countries. © 2009, © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Appreciative Inquiry; Capacity-building; Expert-driven Approaches; International Development; Poverty Alleviation; Western World-view",,,,"SAGE Publications Ltd",02560909,,,,"English","Vikalpa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025840180

However, the magnitude of DR in rural population with diabetes needs exploration. Aim: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors for the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy in the self-reported rural population with diabetes. Settings and Design: In a cross-sectional study, a total of 26,519 participants (age 30 years) attended 198 diabetic retinopathy screening camps conducted in three southern districts of Tamilnadu, India, between February 2004 and April 2006. Materials and Methods: All the participants underwent a dilated eye examination to detect DR by indirect ophthalmoscopy. Systemic and ocular risk factor estimation was done in a comprehensive examination. Statistical Analysis: Univariate and stepwise regression analyses were done to identify the independent risk factors associated with the presence and severity of retinopathy. Results: The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 17.6% among the self-reported rural population with diabetes. The prevalence of referable (sight threatening) retinopathy was 5.3%. Risk factors associated with the development of any DR were male gender (OR= 1.37), longer duration of diabetes (per year, OR= 1.07), lean body mass index (OR= 1.30), higher systolic blood pressure (per 10 mm Hg, OR= 1.18), and insulin treatment (OR= 1.34; P < 0.0001). Risk factors associated with referable retinopathy included longer duration of diabetes (per year, OR= 1.22), lean body mass index (OR= 1.25), higher systolic blood pressure (per 10 mm Hg, OR= 1.03), and insulin treatment (OR= 1.36; P < 0.0001).Conclusion: The study identified risk factors associated with DR in the rural population with diabetes. The results suggested that there was a need for formulating effective preventive strategies to minimize avoidable blindness due to diabetes, in rural areas.","Diabetic retinopathy; Ocular risk factors; Rural population; Systemic risk factors","adult; article; body mass; controlled study; diabetic retinopathy; disease severity; female; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; risk factor; rural population; self report; systolic blood pressure; Adult; Age Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; India; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Ophthalmoscopy; Prevalence; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Self Disclosure; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Young Adult","Sharma, T.; Vision Research Foundation, 18, College Road, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai - 600 006, Tamil Nadu, India; email: drtaruns@gmail.com",,,00223859,,JPMDA,"19550052","English","J.

Overall, we find a moderate and stable average level of systemic risk in European banking. The advent of the Euro came along with a 1-year period of short-run transition dynamics.

Patients are placed into low or high risk groups of developing BONJ depending on the systemic condition for which they have received bisphosphonates. Numerically, the largest group worldwide is patients receiving bisphosphonates for osteoporosis and these generally fall into the low risk group for BONJ. The high risk group, while numerically smaller, is composed of those patients receiving bisphosphonates in the management of malignancy affecting the skeleton, either primary or secondary (metastatic disease). A number of additional systemic and local risk factors are proposed, which have the effect of increasing the risk of BONJ following an extraction. These risk factors may have the effect of moving a low risk categorised patient into a medium, or perhaps more realistically an unknown risk category. An example of a systemic risk factor is the concurrent use of corticosteroids and a local risk factor is mandibular molar extraction. The purpose of this paper is to define and validate an algorithm to guide clinicians in the area of patient information, consent and management for patients currently taking or having previously taken bisphosphonates who require dental extractions. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Newer coronary CTA technology such as prospective ECG-gating will also enable lower dose examinations. Since the current standard of care for coronary diagnoses is catheterization, CT will continue to be benchmarked against catheterization reference points, in particular temporal resolution, spatial resolution, radiation dose, and volume coverage. This article focuses on single heart beat cardiac acquisitions enabled by 320-detector row CT. Imaging with this system can now be performed with patient radiation doses comparable to catheterization. The high image quality, excellent contrast opacification, and absence of stair-step artifact provide the potential to evaluate endothelial shear stress (ESS) noninvasively with CT. Low ESS is known to lead to the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaque culminating in high-risk vulnerable plaque likely to rupture and cause an acute coronary event. The magnitude of local low ESS, in combination with the local remodeling response and the severity of systemic risk factors, determines the natural history of each plaque. This paper describes the steps required to derive an ESS map from 320-detector row CT data using the Lattice Boltzmann method to include the complex geometry of the coronary arterial tree. This approach diminishes the limitations of other computational fluid dynamics methods to properly evaluate multiple coronary arteries, including the complex geometry of coronary bifurcations where lesions tend to develop. © Springer Science+Business Media, B.V. 2009.","Atherosclerosis; Computed tomography; Coronary disease; Shear stress; Vascular remodeling","angiocardiography; artery rupture; article; artifact; atherosclerotic plaque; cardiovascular risk; carotid artery bifurcation; clinical trial; computational fluid dynamics; computed tomographic angiography; contrast enhancement; coronary artery; coronary artery disease; diagnostic imaging; disease course; electrocardiogram; endothelial shear stress; gated imaging; heart beat; heart catheterization; human; image quality; imaging system; intermethod comparison; lattice boltzmann method; low energy radiation; mathematical analysis; multidetector computed tomography; non invasive procedure; pathology; prediction; radiation dose; risk assessment; shear stress","Rybicki, F.J.; Department of Radiology, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA 02115, United States; email: frybicki@partners.org",,,15695794,,IJCIB,,"English","Int.

The sources, the sustainability and the possible adjustment mechanism of external imbalances have been the object of one of the liveliest and most controversial economic policy debates of the past couple of decades. Nonetheless, there is an almost universally shared belief that changes in the overall competitiveness of an economy can be a decisive factor in reversing the sign of its trade balance. Indeed, the role of the real exchange rate in the international adjustment mechanism is regaining attention from the international financial institutions (IMF, 2007). Large corrections of deficits are usually observed to go hand in hand with large devaluations of the nominal and real exchange rate (IMF, 2007; UNCTAD, 2008).

In future, risks will escalate as a consequence of climate change effects and continued population growth. Strategies which seek to reduce the per capita demand for water, and ideally to limit total consumption, appear to be obvious ways of achieving water resource sustainability. Programs which focus on improving the effectiveness in communicating to consumers how water availability is threatened are considered to be an essential part managing demand and ultimately consumption. Effective communication aims to increase public understanding of the problem whilst better informing local decision making and public acceptance of strategies which might be imposed in future to manage scarce water resources. As this problem is inherently complex, effective risk communication is problematic both for those developing management strategies and those who may have such strategies imposed upon them. Advances in computer modelling and simulation, supported by rapid progress in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) provide unprecedented opportunities for demonstrating to the public the complex interrelationships between supply and demand for water. System Dynamics (SD) modelling is a promising approach for enabling learning and communication. While SD is often used to analyse the dynamics of systemic problems and assess policy options, its potential for communicating systemic risks to the public has not been fully exploited. The ongoing research described in this paper aims to develop a SD-based interactive learning tool to help ACT residents develop a systemic perspective of the water management problem and to demonstrate plausible futures they might face. Expected outcomes of this research are an understanding of options for facilitating dialogue among stakeholders, effectively promoting water-wise attitudes and ultimately influencing consumer behaviour. This paper describes the methodology used to collect, analyse and merge views elicited from stakeholders (i.e. users and managers) and to form them into a conceptual causal feedback representation of the problem. This representation forms the basis for subsequent stages in which quantitative models and computer simulations will be developed. The methodology has three stages. Firstly, a preliminary conceptual model was developed based on the systems thinking (ST) and SD literatures. Secondly, local and expert knowledge was captured by eliciting the perceptions of water users (n=25) and managers (n=10) in the ACT using semi-structured interviews. Cognitive Mapping techniques were used to depict participants' perceptions. Finally, noting the potential pitfalls of doing so, the various views were represented in a single conceptual model. An electronic workbook was also used to investigate stakeholders' perceptions of the causal relationships between selected strongly coupled variables and for obtaining estimates of selected parameters needed for subsequent quantitative modelling activities. The ST/SD modelling used in this research is distinguished by the following: as an action research inquiry and that it seeks to demonstrate the recoverability criterion. That is, whilst it is neither possible to comprehensively validate the research findings nor precisely replicate the research elsewhere, every step in the research journey is traceable. Hence understanding of problem and the manifestations of its complexity are enhanced as are the insights into how to develop and implement effective risk communication strategies. © MODSIM 2009.All rights reserved.","Australian Capital Territory region; Knowledge elicitation; System Dynamics modeling; Water management","Climate change; Decision making; Economics; Managers; Population statistics; Public risks; Risk assessment; System theory; Water management; Water supply; Cognitive mapping techniques; Computer modelling and simulation; Effective communication; Information and communications technology; Interactive learning tools; Resource sustainability; Semi structured interviews; System dynamics model; Learning systems","Sawah, S.E.; University of New South Wales, Australia; email: s.elsawah@student.adfa..edu.au","Anderssen R.S.Braddock R.D.Newham L.T.H.","Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand Inc.

Naturally, in a fairly large number of papers concerning the impact of such changes upon systemic risk, the LOLR and its international version have appeared. The latest events surrounding the current credit crunch have revived discussions about the LOLR function. As a result, the information seems to be scattered enough to justify revisiting the literature on the LOLR produced in the last decades.

Others criticize LBOs for causing job losses and burdening companies with too much debt. This book addresses the effect of recent private equity LBOs on acquired companies and employment, the impact of LBOs jointly undertaken by two or more private equity funds on competition, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of private equity funds and their advisers, and regulatory oversight of commercial and investment banks that have financed recent LBOs. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed academic research, analyzed recent LBO data, conducted case studies, reviewed regulators' policy documents and examinations, and interviewed regulatory and industry officials, and academics.

This may be considered surprising since central banks are, effectively, risk managers for the financial system as a whole. In their core functions of designing and implementing monetary policy and safeguarding financial stability, they manage the risk of inflation and the systemic risks inherent in financial crises. Strangely however, until recently, they had not paid as much attention to the management of their own balance sheet risks that emanate from their market operations. A change is obvious in the last fifteen to twenty years. In part as a consequence of the general acceptance of the principle of central bank independence, central banks have been rethinking their governance structure. After all, financial independence of the central banks is an important element in supporting institutional independence from fiscal authorities and understanding, managing and accurately reporting on financial risks is necessary to control financial results. At the same time central banks as investors are facing increased challenges. Some have accumulated considerable sizes of foreign reserves and need to invest them in a diversified manner. This in turn makes them exposed to more complicated markets and more sophisticated instruments.

The central idea is the combination of tools from modern risk management with a network model of interbank loans in a framework that can be applied to bank data usually available to central banks. The key innovations of the model include conceptual as well as applied aspects. The network perspective of the banking system constitutes the conceptual side, whereas the construction of an integrated framework that is also applicable in the daily work of an institution with the mandate to safeguard financial stability addresses the applied side. Combining together new and established concepts from risk management with real world applicability was the guiding principle behind the development of the SRM. Why is there an interest in risk analysis for banks at a system level? And what additional insights can be gained from such an approach in contrast to traditional risk analysis with its focus on individual institutions? As seen in Chapter 11, looking at banks individually conceals two important sources of risk that can potentially result in the joint failure of banks and in extreme situations even a large-scale breakdown of financial intermediation: first, banks might have correlated exposures and an adverse economic shock may directly result in simultaneous multiple bank defaults; second, troubled banks may default on their interbank liabilities and hence cause other banks to default, triggering a domino effect. © Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511635618; 9780521767309,,,"English","Stress-Testing the Bank.

Rev. __ (forthcoming 2012) Introduction A good crisis should never go to waste. In the world of financial regulation, experience has shown – since at least the time of the South Sea Bubble three hundred years ago – that only after a catastrophic market collapse can legislators and regulators overcome the resistance of the financial community and adopt comprehensive “reform” legislation. US financial history both confirms and conforms to this broader generalization. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were the product of the 1929 stock-market crash and the Great Depression, and their enactment had to await the inauguration of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. The decisive event fueling public indignation and shaping these statutes was the Pecora Hearings before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, which continued from 1932 to 1934. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) was enacted, possibly in some haste, in 2002, following the collapse of Enron in late 2001 and WorldCom in 2002 and an accelerating crescendo of financial statement restatements by other public corporations. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, followed an even greater financial collapse, one that threatened financial institutions on a global scale and brought the problem of systemic risk to the attention of a public already infuriated at financial institutions (and their highly compensated investment bankers) being bailed out at taxpayer expense. In each of these episodes, abundant evidence of financial chicanery and fraud was uncovered, and the public was outraged and revulsed. Not surprisingly, in each of these cases, the comprehensive reform legislation that followed in the wake of the market collapse showed hints of the public's desire for retribution. All that is different this time is that the crisis may be wasted – as hereinafter explained. © Eilís Ferran, Niamh Moloney, Jennifer G. Hill and John C.

Background: From a dental perspective, oral piercings and especially tongue piercings are not a harmless fashion trend since they can be associated with local and systemic risks and complications. A search of the literature was conducted to investigate the documentation of health risks associated with tongue piercing using the MEDLINE database as well as the German literature. Review Results: The literature contains numerous case reports, a limited number of studies, and a review describing a wide variety of complications, especially in patients who have undergone tongue piercing. In the majority of cases, the piercing of the tongue is performed in the midline. Piercings are made of different materials, usually metal or synthetic materials. Complications during piercing, immediately following piercing, as well as long term were found. Conclusions: The three cases presented here demonstrate some of those adverse effects. The most commonly described oral complication is the damage of teeth and the periodontium caused by tongue piercings. Tongue piercing is a personal decision, but it is important that patients are fully aware of possible oral health hazards. Clinical Significance: Patients need better information on the potential complications associated with tongue piercing. Dental practitioners should educate patients about potential side effects and possible oral, dental, and systemic complications. © 2009 Seer Publishing LLC.","Oral complications; Oral health hazards; Tongue piercing",,"Ziebolz, D.; Department of Operative Dentistry, , Goettingen, Germany; email: dirk.ziebolz@med.uni-goettingen.de",,"Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd",15263711,,,"20020083","English","J.

Surgical techniques currently used for treating bone defects may count on different alternatives, including autologous vascularized bone grafts, homologous bone graft provided by musculoskeletal tissue bank, heterologous bone graft (xenograft), or prostheses, each one of them dealing with both specific advantages and complications and drawbacks. The main concerns related to these techniques respectively are: donor site morbidity and limited available amount; possible immune response and viral transmission; possible animal-derived pathogen transmission and risk of immunogenic rejection; high invasiveness and surgery-related systemic risks, long post-operative. physical recovery and prostheses revision need. Nowadays, an ideal alternative is the use of osteoconductive synthetic bone substitutes. Many synthetic substitutes are available, used either alone or in combination with other bone graft. Synthetic bone graft materials available as alternatives to autogeneous bone include calcium sulphates, special glass ceramics (bioactive glasses) and calcium phosphates (calcium hydroxyapatite, HA; tricalcium phosphate, TCP; and biphasic calcium phosphate, BCP). These materials differ in composition and physical properties fro each other and from bone (De Groot in Bioceramics of calcium phosphate, pp 100-114, 1983; Hench in J Am Ceram Soc 74:1487-1510, 1994; Jarcho in Clin Orthop 157:259-278, 1981; Daculsi et al. in Int Rev Cytol 172:129-191, 1996). Both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric HA-based substitutes represent the current first choice in orthopedic surgery, in that they provide an osteoconductive scaffold to which chemotactic, circulating proteins and cells (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, osteoinductive growth factors) can migrate and adhere, and within which progenitor cells can differentiate into functioning osteoblasts (Szpalski and Gunzburg in Orthopedics 25S:601-609, 2002). Indeed, HA may be extemporarily combined either with whole autologous bone marrow or PRP (platelet rich plasma) gel inside surgical theatre in order to favour and accelerate bone regeneration. A case of bifocal ulnar bone defect treated with stoichiometric HA-based bone substitute combined with PRP is reported in here, with a 12-month-radiographic follow-up.",,"antiinfective agent; hydroxyapatite; tissue scaffold; article; bone prosthesis; bone regeneration; bone transplantation; case report; ceramics; debridement; drug implant; external fixator; fracture fixation; fracture nonunion; human; instrumentation; internal fixator; male; methodology; middle aged; occupational accident; open fracture; peroperative complication; plastic surgery; thrombocyte rich plasma; ulna fracture; wound infection; Accidents, Occupational; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bone Substitutes; Bone Transplantation; Ceramics; Debridement; Drug Implants; Durapatite; External Fixators; Fracture Fixation; Fractures, Open; Fractures, Ununited; Humans; Internal Fixators; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Middle Aged; Osseointegration; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Surgical Flaps; Tissue Scaffolds; Ulna Fractures; Wound Infection; MLCS; MLOWN","Paderni, S.email: stefania.paderni@ausl.bologna.it",,,19732538,,,"19711008","English","Chir Organi Mov",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951252547

Risks and policies to control them stimulate behavioural changes in society, so stakeholdership evolves as events play out, and defining stakeholders requires the ability to model the adaptive responses involved. Engaging stakeholders is also problematic because of inherent barriers of time, resources and expertise, as well as the scale and complexity of the risks and the large numbers of people involved. Direct participation of stakeholders in risk discourses is therefore limited, and most participation has to be by proxy. Established mechanisms of representation tend to favour more powerful and articulate stakeholders, so new methods to enable participation by proxy (e.g., through use of the internet) need to be developed. Above all, however, the experts and professionals involved in risk assessment and management need to build greater empathy with the wider body of stakeholders on whose behalf they act.

To determine whether a patient's age, gender, local or systemic risk factors affect the rate of preoperative bacterial contamination. Methods. Consecutive 1,474 patients undergoing intraocular surgery were enrolled in this prospective masked study. Past medical history was noted and examinations were performed. The patients were divided into four groups: a control group (without local or systemic risk factors), those with local risk factors (chronic use of topical medications, contact lens wear, blepharitis, chronic eyelid or conjunctival inflammation), those with systemic risk factors (immunosuppression, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, and asthma), and those with both. Conjunctival cultures were obtained before surgery. Results. Among the 1,474 patients, 914 bacteria were isolated from 214 (14.9%) patients. Advanced age was associated with a higher rate of positive conjunctival cultures (p<0.005). No statistical difference was found with regard to gender (p=0.7173). Among the 282 patients in the control group, 14 (5%) had a positive conjunctival culture. Compared to the control group, positive conjunctival cultures were found in 118 out of 503 patients (23.5%) with local risk factors (p<0.0001), 65 out of 545 patients (11.9%) with systemic risk factors (p=0.0019), and 22 out of 144 (15.3%) with both (p=0.0006). Two patients developed postoperative endophthalmitis (0.14%), one with both local risk and systemic factors and the other with a systemic risk factor. Conclusions.

The incidence of BRONJ is not so high, but it is very refractory to ordinary dental treatments, and the bone exposure, a typical symptom, continues for several months. Although many cases of BRONJ have been reported worldwide, the precise pathogenesis remains obscure. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the systemic risk factors contributing in the development of BRONJ. DM is generally associated with microvascular ischemia of the bone, endothelial cell dysfunction, decreased bone turnover and remodeling, resulting in a delayed wound healing and easy to infection. In this issue, the relation of DM as a systemic risk factor with development of BRONJ as well as the incidence, clinical manifestations and prevention and treatment of BRONJ are described.",,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; animal; bone; bone necrosis; bone remodeling; diabetes mellitus; endothelium cell; human; intravenous drug administration; ischemia; jaw disease; microcirculation; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; review; risk factor; vascularization; wound healing; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Bone Remodeling; Diabetes Mellitus; Diphosphonates; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Ischemia; Jaw Diseases; Microcirculation; Osteonecrosis; Risk Factors; Wound Healing","Urade, M.",,,09175857,,,"19721206","Japanese","Clin Calcium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350759849

Several developments played a role, including the proliferation of complex mortgage-backed securities and derivatives with highly opaque structures, high leverage, and inadequate risk management. These, in turn, created systemic risk-that is, the risk that a triggering event, such as the failure of a large financial firm, will seriously impair financial markets and harm the broader economy. This article examines the role of systemic risk in the recent financial crisis. Systemic concerns prompted the Federal Reserve and U.S. Department of the Treasury to act to prevent the bankruptcy of several large financial firms in 2008. The authors explain why the failures of financial firms are more likely to pose systemic risks than the failures of nonfinancial firms and discuss possible remedies for such risks. They conclude that the economy could benefit from reforms that reduce systemic risks, such as the creation of an improved regime for resolving failures of large financial firms. © 2009, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",,,"Bullard, J.; Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisUnited States",,"Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis",00149187,,,,"English","Fed.

The study looks at the different materials, in particular rare metals, used in mobile phones. The dissipation of these materials is discussed as a consequence of the life cycle of mobile phones, especially of the after-use phase. It is claimed that the dissipation and irretrievable loss of these materials could pose a severe risk to the industry. Moreover, we conclude that under the prevailing economic practices, the scarcity of strategic metals used for very specific purposes - often in small but critical amounts - could lead to shortage conflicts and economic drawbacks.","Dissipation of spice metals; Information and communication society; Mobile phone; Raw materials use; Systemic risk",,"Reller, A.; University of Augsburg, , 86159 Augsburg, Germany; email: armin.reller@physik.uni-augsburg.de",,"Oekom Verlag",09405550,,,,"English","GAIA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68849101238

The aim of this review is to refer to systemic risk factors that contribute to the onset and progression of DR and to emphasize the role of general practitioners and other specialists in the long-term care of diabetic patients. Findings: The most important determinants in onset and progression of DR and macular edema are disease duration and the level of metabolic control. Intensive treatment of systemic hypertension reduces the risk of new onset of DR and slows the progression of existing DR. Diabetic nephropathy and anemia can lead to progression of DR. Hyperlipoproteinemia is associated with the amount of macular exudates and increase of visual acuity. Therapeutic anticoagulation is not contraindicated in any form of DR. During pregnancy, decompensation of DR can occur, therefore is it essential to control the patients regularly. Conclusion: Patients' general condition and concomitant systemic disorders might have a significant impact on the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy and loss of vision. Interdisciplinary cooperation in diagnosis and therapy of diabetes and other systemic disorders can improve both the systemic and ocular health of patients with diabetes.","Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic retinopathy; Prevention; Risk factors",,"Křížová, L.; Univerzita Karlova, , Praha, Czech Republic; email: bunik@gmail.com",,"Czech Medical Association J.E.

Using voluntary, confidential and non punitive systematic employee surveys, vulnerable topics and areas in patient care revealing preventable risks can be identified at an early stage. Preventive measures to continuously optimize treatment quality can be defined by creating a risk portfolio and a priority list of vulnerable topics.

Oral cancer mortality had increased dramatically in Hungary to near fourfold between 1975 and 2002 both among the male and female populations. The increased oral cancer morbidity among the non-smoker, non-drinker elderly women and young adults, suggest that factors other than tobacco and alcohol consumption may also have important role in the pathogenesis of oral cancer. To reveal the epidemiological changes oral cancer cases and tumor-free controls were studied in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Semmelweis University in two phases between 1985-1986 and 2004-2005. In the 1st phase of the study, 460 cases with histologically confirmed oral squamous cell cancer and 350 tumor-free control cases were included. In the 2nd phase data of 550 oral cancer cases and 450 tumor-free controls were examined. Location of the tumors, alcohol consumption, and smoking habits of the male and female patients were separately evaluated. Among the oral cancer cases and their controls the ratio of smokers showed a significantly decreasing tendency in the examined period. Both the male oral cancer patients and their controls showed a significant decrease in the ratio of regular drinkers, whereas among the female tumor cases and controls the ratio of alcohol consumers were similarly low in both phases. The high male to female ratio of oral cancer cases significantly decreased over the examined period. Among elderly women (>60 yrs) oral cancer morbidity conspicuously increased. Among male cases the primacy of lower lip cancer had been taken over by sublingual cancer during the examined period. Among female patients, gingival tumor location was the most frequent in both phases. Our data suggest that the extraordinarily rapid increase in oral cancer morbidity and mortality in Hungary is not reasonable simply on the basis of excessive tobacco and alcohol consumption habits. Changes in the male to female ratio of oral cancer after 20 years, the older age of female patients as compared with males and the gender related difference of the prevalent tumor sites suggest some role of gender specific, systemic risk factors for oral cancer.",,"adult; age distribution; aged; article; case control study; drinking behavior; Europe; female; gingiva tumor; human; Hungary; lip tumor; male; middle aged; mouth tumor; risk factor; sex ratio; smoking; squamous cell carcinoma; tongue tumor; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcohol Drinking; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Europe; Female; Gingival Neoplasms; Humans; Hungary; Lip Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Smoking; Tongue Neoplasms","Suba, Z.",,,00155314,,,"19514245","Hungarian","Fogorv Sz",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651146563

The significance of CD20 expression has been evaluated in childhood precursor B-lineage ALL with conflicting results. We retrospectively analyzed the influence of CD20 expression on outcome in 253 adults with de novo precursor B-lineage ALL treated with either conventional (VAD/CVAD) or intensive (hyper-CVAD) frontline chemotherapy regimens in the pre-rituximab era. Overall, CD20 positivity of at least 20% was associated with lower 3-year rates of complete remission duration (CRD; 20% vs 55%, P &lt; .001) and overall survival (OS; 27% vs 40%, p = .03). In the CD20 negative subset, the 3-year rates for CRD (58% vs 42%, p = .04) and OS (60% vs 28%, P &lt; .001) were superior for hyper-CVAD compared with VAD/CVAD; rates were particularly favorable for the CD20 negative younger age group (68% and 85%, respectively). In contrast, 3-year CRD and OS rates were uniformly poor for the CD20-positive group regardless of therapy (27% or less). Multivariate analysis for event-free survival identified older age, leukocyte count higher than 30 x 10 9/L, presence of Philadelphia chromosome, high systemic risk classification, and CD20 positivity as independent predictors of worse outcome. In conclusion, CD20 expression in de novo adult precursor B-lineage ALL appears to be associated with a poor prognosis.

This investigation was classified as descriptive, transversal, field research; the sample consisted of the first six universal banking institutions (in terms of deposit capture) located in the national territory, selected using a non-probabilistic, intentional sample. The data collecting technique consisted of a self-administered Likert-scale questionnaire applied to managers in the different risk units of the main offices for universal-type banking institutions. Results of this investigation show that universal banks do not give out information about how they administer operational risk. Likewise, despite motivation for creating models that permit measuring operational risk, the above mentioned efforts get neutralized because these internal models are not executed by the institutions. Finally, technological management constitutes a differentiating effect on the polled institutions; originating a segmentation of the banking business, which in the long term, harms the institutions as a whole due to the effect of systemic risk.","Diagnostic; Management; Operational risk; Universal banking","banking; management practice; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; South America; Venezuela","Soto Quintana, A.

It begins with a review of those aspects of the subprime crisis that required the large, observed government interventions, namely the feared bankruptcy of individual banks, insurers, and government sponsored enterprises with the potential to create a meltdown of the entire financial system. The paper then develops legislative responses that would make future systemic failures and bailouts of this magnitude highly unlikely. The paper's key analytic device is to distinguish two financial firm activities: (1) risky investment activities (""hedge fund"" division) capable of causing firm bankruptcy, and (2) market-making and related activities ("" infrastructure"" division), the failure of which would have systemic implications. The goal of the proposed regulatory change is to ensure that the infrastructure division is bankruptcy remote and can operate on a stand-alone basis if necessary even when losses from the hedge fund division threaten the holding company's solvency. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.",,,"Jaffee, D.

In this paper, we identify three innovations-one in each of these areas-that could be made to the American mortgage market that would help obtain the government's objectives while enhancing financial market stability-particularly if all are done together. These three innovations are: (1) ""buy your own mortgage"" options, (2) variable maturity mortgages, and (3) creation of a government mortgage bond insurer, with an emphasis on insuring covered bonds as well as GSE debt. The first innovation would allow homebuyers to repurchase their mortgage at the ""market value"" of their homes when they move, thereby helping society avoid some of the deadweight losses associated with unnecessary foreclosures. The second innovation would provide a mortgage that could promote affordable housing without unduly raising the default risks of low- and moderate-income families. The third innovation would help create a variety of financing options for mortgages in the United States. Moreover, it could be integrated into the current system of mortgage financing, which would include government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), in a manner that would help the government manage the systemic risks associated with the quasi-government backing of mortgage credit and mortgage insurance. In particular, we propose that the government explicitly insure pre-designated financial instruments used to fund mortgage credit (such as covered bonds and GSE debt) by creating a government-backed insurance fund similar to that currently used for deposits. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Higher systemic risks induce both higher real interest rates and increased dollarization. Using appropriate instruments for the dollarization ratio, the study overcomes the simultaneous equation problem and correctly estimates a negative coefficient for the dollarization ratio in the interest rate equation. It confirms the theoretical prediction that a strategy of 'dedollarizing' the economy will raise the equilibrium domestic real interest rate if the strategy fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks. Even so, it also finds that this effect is small, after controlling for the risks of dilution and default. The results bring to light the systemic-risk reasons for high interest rates in emerging economies - and contribute to evaluating the difficulties of dedollarization policies. © The Author 2008.

These uncertainties have become more challenging because of the complex, systemic nature of many of the risks. A clear framework defining and quantifying uncertainty is needed. Three dimensions characterise uncertainty: its nature, its location and its level. In terms of its nature, uncertainty can be both intrinsic and extrinsic. The former reflects the effects of complexity, sparseness and nonlinearity; the latter arises through inadequacies in available observational data, measurement methods, sampling regimes and models. Uncertainty occurs in three locations: conceptualising the problem, analysis and communicating the results. Most attention has been devoted to characterising and quantifying the analysis-a wide range of statistical methods has been developed to estimate analytical uncertainties and model their propagation through the analysis. In complex systemic risks, larger uncertainties may be associated with conceptualisation of the problem and communication of the analytical results, both of which depend on the perspective and viewpoint of the observer. These imply using more participatory approaches to investigation, and more qualitative measures of uncertainty, not only to define uncertainty more inclusively and completely, but also to help those involved better understand the nature of the uncertainties and their practical implications. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Conceptualising; Epidemiology; Health risk; Uncertainty","communication; conceptual framework; conference proceeding; environmental impact assessment; epidemiology; estimation method; health impact; health risk; measurement method; model; participatory approach; planning method; sampling; uncertainty analysis; conference paper; environmental health; human; pollutant; risk assessment; statistical model; uncertainty; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Models, Statistical; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty","Briggs, D.J.; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom; email: d.briggs@imperial.ac.uk",,,02694042,,,"18972068","English","Environ.

It has been suggested that poor oral health and periodontal disease, in particular, associate with adverse birth outcomes. However, previous reports on the topic are conflicting. The objective of the present cross-sectional study was therefore to compare the oral health parameters of a racially and socio-economically homogeneous group of women who gave birth before 259 gestational days (37 weeks) with those of women who went full-term. Material and Methods. We studied various dental parameters, including prevalence of dental caries, gingival bleeding on probing, the probing periodontal pocket depths, and the carriage of periodontal pathogens in 328 all-Caucasian women with singleton births. Seventy-seven of the women had preterm births, while 251 had full-term. Dental data were recorded within 2 days postpartum and analyzed with data from medical history, prenatal care, and delivery records. Results. Preterm mothers had more dental caries (93.5%) than full-term mothers (85.3%) when assessed as carious teeth in the mouth (p=0.06). In clinical and microbiological periodontal health parameters, however, no differences could be seen between the preterm and full-term mothers. Primiparity, low weight-gain, and antimicrobial drug use during pregnancy were the significant predictors for preterm birth. Conclusions. Although we cannot make any causal linkage, the oral health parameters were no different in women who experienced preterm births compared with those who had full-term births in this cohort. Only established systemic risk factors explained the preterm birth. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

In recent years, however, it has become apparent that many of the risks facing society are systemic in nature - complex risks, set within wider social, economic and environmental contexts. Reflecting this, policy-making too has become more wide-ranging in scope, more collaborative and more precautionary in approach. In order to inform such policies, more integrated methods of assessment are needed. Based on work undertaken in two large EU-funded projects (INTARESE and HEIMTSA), this paper reviews the range of approaches to assessment now in used, proposes a framework for integrated environmental health impact assessment (both as a basis for bringing together and choosing between different methods of assessment, and extending these to more complex problems), and discusses some of the challenges involved in conducting integrated assessments to support policy. Integrated environmental health impact assessment is defined as a means of assessing health-related problems deriving from the environment, and health-related impacts of policies and other interventions that affect the environment, in ways that take account of the complexities, interdependencies and uncertainties of the real world. As such, it depends heavily on how issues are selected and framed, and implies the involvement of stakeholders both in issue-framing and design of the assessment, and to help interpret and evaluate the results. It is also a comparative process, which involves evaluating and comparing different scenarios. It consequently requires the ability to model the way in which the influences of exogenous factors, such as policies or other interventions, feed through the environment to affect health. Major challenges thus arise. Chief amongst these are the difficulties in ensuring effective stakeholder participation, in dealing with the multicausal and non-linear nature of many of the relationships between environment and health, and in taking account of adaptive and behavioural changes that characterise the systems concerned. © 2008 Briggs; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"environmental exposure; environmental health; human; methodology; occupational exposure; occupational health; review; risk assessment; risk management; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Risk Assessment; Risk Management","Briggs, D.

Recent work on cellular responses to flow has identified potential mechanosensors and pathways that may influence disease progression. These results led us to hypothesize that the same mechanisms that mediate adaptive responses in the vasculature become maladaptive at sites of disturbed flow. Subsequent changes in gene expression and matrix remodeling help to entrain these inflammatory pathways.

A mouse genetics approach can simplify the genetic analysis and provide tools for mechanistic studies. Methods and Results - We previously identified atherosclerosis susceptibility QTL (Athsq1) on chromosome 4 acting independently of systemic risk factors. We now report confirmation of this locus in congenic strains carrying the MOLF-derived susceptibility allele in the C57BL/6J-Ldlr-/- genetic background. Homozygous congenic mice exhibited up to 4.5-fold greater lesion area compared to noncongenic littermates (P&lt;0.0001). Analysis of extracellular matrix composition revealed prominent accumulation of versican, a presumed proatherogenic matrix component abundant in human lesions but almost absent in the widely-used C57BL/6 murine atherosclerosis model. The results of a bone marrow transplantation experiment suggested that both accelerated lesion development and versican accumulation are mediated, at least in part, by macrophages. Interestingly, comparative mapping revealed that the Athsq1 congenic interval contains the mouse region homologous to a widely-replicated CHD locus on human chromosome 9p21. Conclusion - These studies confirm the proatherogenic activity of a novel gene(s) in the MOLF-derived Athsq1 locus and provide in vivo evidence for a causative role of versican in lesion development. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.","Atherosclerosis; Congenic strain; Extracellular matrix; Genetics; Mapping","versican; allele; animal experiment; animal model; article; atherosclerosis; atherosclerosis susceptibility QTL1 gene; bone marrow transplantation; C57BL 6 mouse; cardiovascular risk; chromosome 4; chromosome 9p; congenic strain; controlled study; experimental model; extracellular matrix; female; gene; gene locus; gene mapping; gene replication; genetic analysis; genetic susceptibility; homozygote; immunohistochemistry; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; risk factor; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Homozygote; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Congenic; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Quantitative Trait Loci; Receptors, LDL; RNA, Messenger; Species Specificity; Versicans","Welch, C.

On the one side, research focuses on the impact of monetary policy on economic growth, unemployment, and output-price inflation, while ignoring financial aspects. On the other side, some scholars leave aside macroeconomics in order to study the narrow, but crucial, subjects of financial behaviours, and financial supervision and regulation. This book aims at merging both approaches by using macroeconomic analysis to show that financial considerations should be the main preoccupation of central banks. Eric Tymoigne shows how different views regarding the conception of asset pricing lead to different positions regarding the appropriate role of a central bank in the economy. In addition, Hyman P. Minsky's framework of analysis is used extensively and is combined with other elements of the Post Keynesian framework to study the role of a central bank. Tymoigne argues that central banks should be included in a broad policy strategy that aims at achieving stable full employment. Their sole goal should be to promote financial stability, which is the best way they can contribute to price stability and full employment. Central banks should stop moving their policy rate frequently and widely because that creates inflation, speculation, and economic instability. Instead, Tymoigne considers a pro-active financial policy that does not allow financial innovations to enter the economy until they are certified to be safe and that focuses on analyzing systemic risk. He argues that central banks should be a guide and a reformer that allow a smooth financing and funding of asset positions, while making sure that financial fragility does not increase drastically over a period of expansion. This book will be of interest to students and researchers engaged with central banking, macroeconomics, asset pricing and monetary economics. © 2009 éric Tymoigne.

There is widespread confusion, though, about the causes and even the definition of systemic risk, and uncertainty about how to control it. This Article offers a conceptual framework for examining what risks are truly ""systemic,"" what causes those risks, and how, if at all, those risks should be regulated. Scholars historically have tended to think of systemic risk primarily in terms of financial institutions such as banks. However, with the growth of disintermediation, in which companies can access capital-market funding without going through banks or other intermediary institutions, greater focus should be devoted to financial markets and the relationship between markets and institutions. This perspective reveals that systemic risk results from a type of tragedy of the commons in which market participants lack sufficient incentive, absent regulation, to limit risk-taking in order to reduce the systemic danger to others. Law, therefore, has a role in reducing systemic risk.",,,"Schwarcz, S. L.; Department of Law and Business, United States; email: schwarcz@law.duke.edu",,,00168092,,,,"English","Georget.

Although the link between this catastrophic disease and very high mortality is well recognized, even after undergoing emergent revascularization, the systemic risk stratification and longterm outcome are currently unclear. The clinical presentation, parameter-related in-hospital death and long-term outcomes of these patients with acute LMCA obstruction undergoing emergency revascularization were carefully reviewed. Methods and Results: From January 2000 through December 2007, 1,588 patients were diagnosed to have STEMI and received emergent cardiac catheterization. The 38 (2.4%) of these 1,588 patients were enrolled into the present study due to LMCA obstruction. The analytical results identified the 30-day mortality rate as 42.1% (16/38). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that renal insufficiency was independently predictive of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR): 5.642; p=0.029), whereas successful revascularization was independently predictive of freedom from in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.174; p=0.044). The cut-off value of a Parsonnet score >20 was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (p=0.002). Conclusions: Even undergoing emergency revascularization for patients with acute LMCA obstruction, the inhospital mortality remains very high. Additionally, the worse clinical outcome was observed in those with renal insufficiency and Parsonnet score of >20.","Left main coronary artery; Revascularization; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction","adult; aged; article; clinical feature; controlled study; coronary artery obstruction; female; heart infarction; human; left coronary artery; major clinical study; male; mortality; prognosis; revascularization; risk; scoring system; ST segment elevation; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Body Height; Body Weight; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping; Kidney Failure; Male; Medical Records; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Revascularization; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Smoking; Survival Analysis; Survivors; Thrombolytic Therapy","Yip, H.-K.; Department of Internal Medicine, No.123, Ta-Pei Road, Niao-Sung Township, Kaohsiung County, 83301, Taiwan; email: hkyip@adm.cgmh.org.tw",,,13469843,,CJIOB,"18762703","English","Circ.

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed at a tertiary referral eye hospital on patients who presented with DSCH following glaucoma surgery. Cases were compared with a matched-control population that underwent equivalent procedures but did not develop DSCH. The main outcome parameters were incidence of DSCH, risk factors associated with its occurrence, visual outcome and prognostic factors. Results: Of the 2752 glaucoma surgeries performed during the 10-year recruitment period, 29 cases of DSCH (1%) were identified. An increased incidence of DSCH was observed after glaucoma drainage device implantation compared with trabeculectomy-associated DSCH (p<0.0001; odds ratio 3.4; 95% Cl 1.9 to 5.4). Risk factors for DSCH included low postoperative intraocular pressure (≤3 mm Hg; p<0.001), aphakia (p<0.001), prior intraocular surgery (p<0.002), hypertension (p<0.001), anticoagulation (p = 0.002), ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.001) and respiratory disease (p = 0.008). The visual outcome of patients with haemorrhage was poor (logMAR 1.34 (SD 0.41)) and was significantly worse when compared with the control group (p = 0.002). Conclusions: In this study cohort, DSCH occurred more frequently after glaucoma drainage device implantation compared with trabeculectomy.

A substantial number of studies identified the connection between blood velocities in retrobulbar vessels, ocular perfusion pressure and optic nerve head blood flow and its regulation and the presence and/or progression of POAG. In addition new insights in the relationship between local and systemic risk factors were gained, identifying POAG as a group of diseases with a complex pathogenesis including an altered hemodynamic situation. However, controlled studies to investigate the possible protective effect of interventions targeting the blood flow situation independently of changing intraocular pressure are still missing. In addition clinical methods to measure volumetric optic nerve head blood flow are still missing. Because of its complex nature, with local and systemic risk factor, the treatment of POAG often does not target the eye only. A patient suspected to have impaired ocular blood flow in the presence of glaucoma should be subjected to a primary vascular examination and if necessary be transferred to a specialized center of ophthalmology. 24 h blood pressure and profiles of intraocular pressure as well as blood work and exclusion of sleep apnea should be performed. Primary target is the consolidation of 24 h intraocular pressure, blood pressure (avoiding either arterial hypertension as well as hypotension) and blood oxygenation. In addition vasospastic syndromes and hypovolemia can be treated and a detailed local exam using cutting edge technology should be performed. The results of such intensive diagnostics often are first time diagnosis of systemic diseases, followed by interdisciplinary treatment with collaborations between the ophthalmologist and the departments of internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, radiology, and vascular surgery. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Glaucoma; Impaired ocular blood flow; Intraocular pressure; Ocular blood flow; Pathogenesis; POAG",,"Reitsamer, H.

We discuss a new U.S. court decision which will likely curtail the use of equity decoupling strategies to avoid large shareholder disclosure rules. Debt decoupling involving the unbundling of the economic rights, contractual control rights, and legal and other rights normally associated with debt, through credit derivatives and securitisation. Corporations can have empty and hidden creditors, just as they can have empty and hidden shareholders. 'Hybrid decoupling' across standard equity and debt categories is also possible. All forms of decoupling appear to be increasingly common. Debt decoupling can pose risks at the firm level for what can be termed 'debt governance' - the overall relationship between creditor and debtor, including creditors' exercise of contractual and legal rights with respect to firms and other borrowers. Widespread debt decoupling can also involve externalities and therefore create systemic financial risks; we explore those risks. © 2008 The Authors.","CDOs; Credit default swaps; Debt decoupling; Disclosure; Empty voting; Equity decoupling; Equity swaps; Hidden ownership; Hybrid decoupling; Securities and Exchange Commission; Securitisation; Systemic risk",,"Hu, H.

Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but serious adverse effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Due to inhibitory actions on bone turnover, bisphosphonate therapy may result in the accumulation of microdamage. Case summary: A 74-year-old Korean woman (height, 150 cm; weight, 51 kg) was referred to the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea, for evaluation of pain and persistent abnormal exposure of jaw bone after extraction of teeth. She had been receiving weekly oral alendronate treatment for osteoporosis for ~5 years. The patient had the clinical features of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the mandible, which was precipitated by teeth extraction ~14 months prior to the outpatient referral visit. At her clinical baseline visit, serum hormone concentrations and bone turnover markers were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone, 0.88 μIU/mL (reference range, 0.25-5.00 μIU/mL); 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 20.9 (9.0-37.6) ng/mL; parathyroid hormone (PTH), 57 (11-62) pg/mL; serum osteocalcin, 8.7 (12.9-55.9) ng/mL; and urine N-telopeptide 21 (26-124) nM/mM creatinine. She had multiple systemic risk factors for ONJ, including older age, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and long duration of bisphosphonate therapy. There was no mandibular lesion improvement despite repeated surgical procedures performed within a 14-month period. Bisphosphonate therapy was discontinued and PTH therapy was started. After 2 months, exposed oral mucosa had healed. After 4 months of treatment, the pain had completely subsided, and after 6 months the patient's eating and drinking habits returned. The serum concentration of osteocalcin, a bone formation marker, which was initially suppressed (8.7 ng/mL), increased 174% (15.1 ng/mL) from baseline after 6 months of treatment with PTH. Conclusions: Here we report a probable case of oral bisphosphonate-associated ONJ featuring suppressed bone turnover. Treatment with the bone formation-stimulating agent PTH was beneficial. © 2008 Excerpta Medica Inc.

We investigated whether non-uniform shear stress at bifurcations induces pro-atherogenic endothelial dysfunction and monocyte recruitment. Bifurcating flow-through cell culture slides were used to expose HUVECs to laminar or non-uniform shear stress for 18 h at 10 dyne/cm 2. For the adhesion assay, HUVECs were subsequently perfused with medium containing THP-1 monocytes for 1 h. Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence. In areas exposed to laminar shear stress, alignment of endothelial cells with the flow was observed, accompanied by upregulation of eNOS and downregulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In contrast, cells exposed to non-uniform shear stress near the outer walls of bifurcations were characterized by irregular, unaligned shape, induction of endothelin-1 and CTGF, as well as reduced eNOS expression. These atherogenic effects of non-uniform shear stress were prevented when cells were treated with statins (1 μmol/l) during flow. Under non-uniform shear stress, a slight induction of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-/P-selectin was observed. In agreement with this, monocyte recruitment, which was nearly undetectable under laminar shear stress, was moderately induced by non-uniform shear stress (P&lt;0.02). In conclusion, inhibition of antioxidative eNOS and upregulation of atherogenic proteins is the first step in non-uniform shear stress-mediated endothelial dysfunction, which in vivo in the presence of atherogenic risk factors may further enhance monocyte recruitment into the artery wall. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

Third, an increase in real interest rates has a negative impact on the financial position of borrowers and loan portfolio quality in all the five CEEs.

This is a paradox since the changing nature of banking risks as more economies liberalise and develop their financial systems, as well as ongoing innovation, makes the use of EWS for informing policies aimed at preventing crises more necessary than ever. In this context, we assess the logit and signal extraction EWS for banking crises on a comprehensive common dataset. We suggest that logit is the most appropriate approach for global EWS and signal extraction for country-specific EWS. Furthermore, it is important to consider the policy maker's objectives when designing predictive models and setting related thresholds since there is a sharp trade-off between correctly calling crises and false alarms. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Consecutive infants treated with laser at our institution and infants referred from outside centers with progression to stage 4 or 5 ROP after laser treatment were included in this retrospective study. Two groups were identified: those with regression of ROP after laser (LT group; 196 eyes of 98 infants) and those with progression to stage 4 or 5 ROP after laser (ST group; 134 eyes of 80 infants). RESULTS: Using a multiple logistic regression model, there was a statistically significant association for progression of treated ROP to retinal detachment (RD) with history of sepsis (P < 0.001), oxygen therapy (P = 0.003), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.003), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; P = 0.005), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; P = 0.042).

Results: 208 eyes met the study criteria. Patients ranged in age from 14 to 82 years (mean, 66 years) and had 8 to 64 years (mean, 47.5 years) of history of diabetes. Significant risk factors for CSME were older age, high levels of HgbA1c, high values of blood pressure, tobacco smoking, high cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol and high levels of proteinuria and microalbuminuria. Conclusion: Independent on the type of diabetes, patients with long standing diabetes have a high risk to develop diabetic maculopathy, but other closely-related risk factors are hypertension, hyperglyce mia, lipids, tobacco smoking and renal status.","Albuminuria; CSME; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic maculopathy; Dyslipemia; Hyperglycemia; Hypertension; Tobacco smoke","adolescent; adult; aged; article; diabetic retinopathy; female; human; male; middle aged; retina macula edema; retrospective study; risk factor; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","Asensio-Sánchez, V.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data 1999 to 2005. Demographic data and injury severity score were obtained from medical records. Factors reviewed included perioperative complications (nonunion, postoperative infection, loss of fixation) and time to radiographic and clinical union. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with 16 distal femur and 36 proximal tibia fractures were treated using temporary EF. Patients subsequently underwent ORIF (mean time from EF to ORIF = 5 days, range 1-23 days). Thirty-five fractures were open (Gustilo I = 8, II = 6, IIIA = 3, IIIB = 13, IIIC = 5) and 17 closed. Forty patients with 44 fractures reached 1-year follow-up. Of these, 36 patients with 40 (91%) fractures had healed both radiographically and clinically. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 14 months (range 3-68). Eight (16%) deep infections occurred, all in open fractures (Gustilo I = 2, IIIB = 3, IIIC = 3), with one patient requiring above knee amputation. Other complications included one hematoma, two malunions, one fixation failure, and one pin site infection. One patient died as a result of a stroke. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Temporary bridging EF offers the advantage of early soft tissue and bone stabilization without the potential local risks of immediate ORIF in severely injured soft tissues, or the potential systemic risks in a severely traumatized patient. The 16% infection rate in this study, all occurring in open fractures, falls within the reported range for grade III open fractures (15%-20%). We conclude that the initial treatment of high-energy periarticular knee fractures with bridging EF, followed by planned conversion to internal fixation is a safe option in patients who are unsuitable for initial definitive surgery. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Conversion; External; Fixation; Fracture; Internal; Knee; Temporary","adolescent; adult; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; femur fracture; follow up; fracture external fixation; hematoma; human; infection; injury scale; knee amputation; male; medical record; osteosynthesis; perioperative complication; postoperative care; postoperative complication; priority journal; proximal tibia fracture; stroke; treatment failure; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Femoral Fractures; Fracture Fixation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Tibial Fractures; Treatment Outcome","Parekh, A.

Each individual systemic risk factor of coronary heart disease (CHD) is associated with elevated IOP, although no reports have argued for a correlation between the risk factors for CHD and IOP after a comprehensive or collective analysis. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III presented the Framingham projection, which can predict the risk of CHD quantitatively. We investigated the association between IOP and the Framingham projection in 16,383 Korean subjects. The Framingham projection was applied using the indicated risk factors. The associations between the Framingham projection and IOP and the influences of the risk factors on the IOP were examined. The Framingham projection was correlated with the mean IOP in women (p<0.05). The relationship between IOP and systemic variables other than smoking was significant (p<0.05). The mean IOP was significantly higher in the high-risk CHD group than in the low-risk group based on the Framingham projection (p<0.05). Because an elevated IOP was associated with cardiovascular risk factors, subjects with a high CHD risk based on the Framingham projection need continuous monitoring for IOP to prevent glaucomatous visual field defects.

Because financial crises are realizations of downside risk, we measure their incidence by the skewness of credit growth. Unlike variance, negative skewness isolates the impact of the large, infrequent, and abrupt credit busts associated with crises. We find a robust negative link between skewness and GDP growth in a large sample of countries over 1960-2000. This suggests a positive effect of systemic risk on growth. To explain this finding, we present a model in which contract enforceability problems generate borrowing constraints and impede growth. In financially liberalized economies with moderate contract enforceability, systemic risk taking is encouraged and increases investment. This leads to higher mean growth but also to greater incidence of crises. In the data, the link between skewness and growth is indeed strongest in such economies.",,,,,,00335533,,QJECA,,"English","Q.

Methods: 188 patients who presented to us in eye Ophthalmology Department of Sur regional hospital with corneal ulcers were analyzed retrospectively. The historical aspects including the systemic and local predisposing factors, clinical picture of the ulcer which was noted on slit lamp at the time of presentation, results of culture for which material was taken by scraping of the ulcer, and its sensitivity pattern, type of management, and its outcome, were noted and the results were interpreted. Results: 60.83% were males above the age of 60 years. Severe ulcers were seen in 36.17% of cases. 43.18% of cases showed positive culture of which 88.2% were bacteria and rest were fungal isolates. Of the bacteria 53.84% were pseudomonas, and 20% staphylococcus. 83.5% were put on fortified gentamycin and 68.61% were on cefuroxime in the initial dual therapy. 37.23% were on ciprofloxacin one time or another during the course of the ulcer. 69.14% of cases recovered fully and 9.57% improved. 54.25% needed hospitalization for less than 1 week and 34% for less than 2 weeks. 58.76% of cases recovered in less than 3 weeks. As local predisposing factors 45 cases (24%) were post surgery, and 29 cases (15.4 %) were having CDK (climatic droplet keratopathy). Diabetes was seen in 8.5% of cases. Conclusion: Corneal ulcer was seen predominantly in males above the age of 60 years, pseudomonas being the main etiological organism. Dual therapy was the commonest empirical therapy. No major systemic risk factor was identified. Post surgical and CDK were the predominant local risk factors. © 2008, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

In addition, he suggested that international financial markets required the continuing elaboration of multilateral standards, codes, and best practices if future crises were to be avoided (Camdessus 1998). It did not take long for skeptics of this G8 proposal to rear their heads; after all, grandiose phrases like “new financial architecture” naturally provoked them. In a speech before the World Affairs Council, for example, Berkeley professor and former US Treasury official J. Bradford DeLong stated that “there is no world-wide political consensus” with respect to the systemic risks facing the global economy and that, as a consequence, “dreams of a rebuilt, reformed, and renewed international financial architecture will remain nothing but dreams” (DeLong 1999). Beyond these skeptics lurked the critics who – whether coming from the left or the right of the political spectrum – curiously shared the conspiratorial view that the new international financial architecture represented nothing more than another underhanded attempt by governments and international organizations to bail out reckless banks at taxpayer expense. © Cambridge University Press, 2009 and Bank for International Settlements 2008.",,,"Kapstein, E.B.; INSEADFrance",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511510779; 9780521877794,,,"English","The Past and Future of Central Bank Cooperation",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927008185

This chapter provides some pointers as to how smart policy can turn private initiative into a force for adaptation. It focuses on three instruments: Insurance, environmental markets and public private partnerships. Insurance has a long track record as a way to share weather risks. However, as climate damages grow insurance will become riskier. Public policy measures will be needed to overcome this problem, for example through publicly funded adaptation measures that bring down risks or by sharing the most extreme layer of risks with commercial insurers. Public policy should not, however, subsidise the systemic risks, as this may sustain activities that become progressively less viable under the changing climate. Environmental markets and pricing have a key role to play in the preservation of natural systems, even without climate change. They incentivise owners to preserve natural assets and consumers to use them carefully. From an adaptation point of view, environmental markets and pricing serve two main purposes. First, they reduce baseline stress, making systems more resilient. Second, they can help to monetise the adaptation services provided by ecosystems. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), meanwhile, can help to overcome operational constraints and accelerate investment in infrastructure, which will likely be the most expensive part of adaptation and, therefore, put considerable strain on the administrative and financial capacity of governments. PPPs may also play a role in research and development and the search for better adaptation technologies. © OECD 2008.",,,"Fankhauser, S.",,"Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)",,9789264046214; 9789264046030,,,"English","Econ.

The GDP growth might have improved borrowers' ability to serve their bank loans in Slovenia, meanwhile the accelerating NPL ratio dynamics has failed to support the hypothesis that the GDP growth fosters an improvement in the NPL ratio in the case of Slovakia. Meanwhile deceleration in the NPL ratio on export impulses has supported a procyclical theory in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia. The response of non-performing loans to inflation supports the hypothesis about the lowering inflation that decelerates the NPL ratio. Savings have accelerated the NPL ratio in the case of Slovakia and Slovenia.

Our results show that average pair-wise correlations significantly differ among countries and that the probability that a specific shock extends to other banks is better explained by asset risk indicators and market based risk measures, such as systematic risk, for cross country contagion. In contrast, for domestic contagion, liquidity risk indicators and bank opaqueness proxies perform better.

Methods: This prospective interventional care series included 16 patients (17 eyes) of choroidal neovascularization secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration who were treated with PDT with verteporfin followed by an injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab on the same day. The main outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity as recorded by both Snellen and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (logMAR), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson Chart), retreatment frequency, and frequency of side effects. Results: Seventeen eyes underwent PDT with verteporfin and intravitreal 0.5 mg ranibizumab, following PDT. Patients were followed up every month for a total period of 6 months. Initial visual acuity ranged from CF to 20/32 and final acuity ranged from CF to 20/20. Visual acuity stabilized (gain/loss <2 lines) in 14 out of 17 eyes (82.35%) and improved in 3 out of 17(17.65%). Contrast sensitivity improved in 15 out of17 eyes (82.24%) There were no cases of ocular/systemic adverse events.

Nevertheless, there is also a downside to the widespread and increasing use of drugs: the occurrence of their residues in the aquatic environment and in drinking water. Although there is evidence for negative effects of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in some animal and plant species, it has not yet been shown which risks in fact exist for humans and the environment. At the same time there is evidence that people will reject drinking water which contains only the smallest traces of APIs, despite claims that such traces are harmless. In this mélange of high uncertainties, subjective risk perception, and the undisputed societal benefit of pharmaceuticals, established risk management procedures are likely to fail. Addressing this issue, the article will suggest applying the concept of systemic risk to the case of APIs in drinking water. With this concept as basis a practical approach to risk management will be presented. It draws upon the recently developed concept of risk governance, as well as the precautionary principle. Finally, concrete measures for risk precaution in the spheres of drug development, handling of drugs, and technical emissions control in urban water management will be presented.","Drinking water; Drug development; Health-care system; Pharmaceutical; Precautionary principle; Risk governance; Systemic risk; Urban water management",,"Keil, F.; Institute for Social-Ecological Research (ISOE), Hamburger Allee 45, 60486 Frankfurt on the Main, Germany; email: keil@isoe.de",,"Oekom Verlag",09405550,,,,"English","GAIA",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57849086772

Material and methods: The study retrospectively analyzed 90 consecutive patients with gangrene of Fournier treated in our institution between 1975 and 2008. We evaluated the average age, associated systemic diseases, and the source, time of evolution and extent of necrotizing fasciitis. The outcomes were assessed according to whether the patient survived or died. All patients had aggressive surgical debridement, and received parenteral antibiotic therapy. Results: The mortality rate was 34.4%. The mean age was 63.0 years (range 33-95), a statistically significant difference was found between the age of the survivors (median age, 59.84 years) and those who died (median age, 70.20 years) (p = 0.001). Medical comorbidities were identified in 51 patients; the death rate was higher in patients who had any medical disease, especially those who suffered from cancer. Although diabetes mellitus was the most common associated pathology, it was not related to a statistically significant worst prognosis. The source of the infection was identified in 62 patients, who showed a higher mortality (p = 0.015), the mortality rate when a urological source is identified was 50%. Moreover, patients suffering from a more extensive necrotizing infection showed a worst prognosis. Conclusions: The gangrene of Fournier has a high mortality rate. Large series are required to study prognostic variables of this disease. The patient age, the presence of systemic risk factors, especially cancer, a urological source of infection and the extent of the disease have impact on the prognosis of Fournier's gangrene.","Fournier Gangrene; Male genitalia; Prognosis, treatment",,"Medina Polo, J.; Servicio de Urología, Avda. de Andalucía s/n, 28041 Madri, Spain; email: josemedinapolo@telefonica.net",,"Ene Ediciones S.A.",02104806,,AUESD,"19143295","Spanish","Actas Urol.

In the model, the hypothesis of a trend reinforcement in the stochastic process describing the fragility of the nodes, induces a trade-off in the systemic risk with respect to the density of the network. Increasing the average link density, the network is first less exposed to systemic risk, while above an intermediate value the systemic risk increases. This result offers a simple explanation for the emergence of instabilities in financial systems that get increasingly interwoven. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the probability density function of the average fragility. This converges to a unique stationary distribution which can be computed numerically and can be used to estimate the systemic risk as a function of the parameters of the model. © American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.","Birkhoff-Jentzsch theorem; Mean-field approximation; Persistent random walk; Stochastic process","Economic and social effects; Random processes; Risk perception; Risks; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Birkhoff-Jentzsch theorem; Financial networks; Financial system; Mean field approximation; Network fragilities; Persistent random walk; Probability density evolutions; Stationary distribution; Probability density function","Lorenz, J.; Department of Systems Design, Kreuzplatz 5, 8032 Zürich, Switzerland; email: jalorenz@ethz.ch",,"American Institute of Mathematical Sciences",15561801,,,,"English","Netw.

In order to fill this gap, in 2002 a Franco-German recommendation for surgical hand preparation was published as a first step towards a generally accepted European recommendation. Based on an assessment of the actual literature, a protocol for surgical hand preparation is discussed with the aim to recommend evidence-based standard procedures including prerequisites, washing and disinfection phase, and its practical implementation. In contrast to hygienic hand disinfection, for surgical hand preparation compliance is not an issue, since it mostly is regarded as a ceremony which is carried out without exception. Nevertheless, the following factors influence acceptance and efficacy: skin tolerance, ease of use, duration of procedure, and recommended time), potential for impaired efficacy due to incorrect performance of the procedure, possibility of systemic risks and irritating potential by applied preparations, religious restrictions, ecological aspects, costs and safety. Here, we report our experience with the introduction of a new hand preparation regime in all surgical disciplines in our university hospital based on the above factors. The following statements were evaluated: • The immediate efficacy of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant is impaired by a preceding hand wash for up to 10 minutes. Therefore hands should not be routinely washed before the disinfection period unless there is a good reason for it such as visible soiling. • A shortened application time (1.5 minutes) is equal to 3 min in terms of efficacy. • Hands should be air dried before gloves are put on, otherwise the perforation rate of gloves will increase. • The efficacy of alcohol-based disinfectants is significantly higher when hands are allowed to dry for 1 minute after the washing phase and before the disinfection phase. To clarify the above questions before the establishment of the modified technique, the surgical team was invited to a meeting. As a result, the heads of surgical departments supported the new technique and decided to change their practice. © 2008 The Hospital Infection Society.","Compliance; Experimental-based surgical hand disinfection; Post surgical hand hygiene; Surgical hand preparation","2 propanol; alcohol; chlorhexidine; disinfectant agent; povidone iodine; propanol; soap; sulfur; triclosan; anaphylaxis; article; clinical protocol; clinical trial; contact dermatitis; disinfection; dry skin; evidence based medicine; France; Germany; hand washing; hospital cost; human; infection risk; intermethod comparison; medical education; nonhuman; postoperative period; practice guideline; preoperative period; religion; safety; skin defect; skin irritation; surgical infection; surgical ward","Kramer, A.; Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Germany",,"W.B.

In recent decades, although the real economy has become less volatile, the financial markets have not; they remain volatile and unpredictable. Exploring the driving forces behind market volatility provides investors a basis for an effective response in dealing with market risk. Markets are, in effect, complex adaptive systems. They are composed of a great number of decentralized decision makers who are continually digesting information and interacting in unanticipated and nonlinear ways. That markets are complex adaptive systems has critical implications for how we think about and manage investment risk. In risk management, we must focus on the market mechanisms driving capital markets to higher volatility, including the emotions of investors, complexity of adaptive markets, and advances in technology and mathematical modeling. Improving risk management means finding new tools to measure the interconnectedness of markets plus the total amount of systemic risk, leverage, and liquidity in the markets.

When bank loan returns have a common systematic factor, the cost of borrowing for a bank increases when there is adverse news on other banks since such news conveys adverse information about the common factor. The increase in a bank's cost of borrowing relative to the situation of good news about other banks is greater when bank loan returns have less commonality (in addition to the systematic risk factor). Hence, banks herd and undertake correlated investments so as to minimize the impact of such information contagion on the expected cost of borrowing.

However, they do not account for the interaction between risks, for example, the occurrence of one risk exacerbating other risks or portfolios of risks being more significant than the sum of the individual risks. This leads to the need to consider risk systemicity as a part of risk analysis. This paper reports on a specific case for a large multinational project based organization, one that the authors had been involved with in the analysis of a number of projects that had massive cost overruns. Following these analyses the organization was persuaded of the importance of risk systemicity. The organization therefore engaged the authors to develop a Risk Filter. This filter is a tool for identifying areas of risk exposure on future projects and creating a framework for their investigation. The Risk Filter is now used on all projects ever since its introduction; by the end of May 2003 it had been used by nine divisions, on over 60 major projects, and completed by 450 respondents. It is also used at several stages during the life of a project to aid in the risk assessment and management of each project, and contributes to a project database. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd.

When homogeneous financial institutions are linked with each other through the credit chain, a gridlock takes place as equilibrium in the payment and settlement system. A heterogeneous participant in the system could, however, have incentive to fulfill the obligation when otherwise homogenous participants strategically default. That is, fulfillment of obligation turns out to be a Nash equilibrium strategy for the heterogeneous participant whose level of investment return differs from those of remaining participants. The larger the benefit is, the stronger incentive a financial institution has to keep the system working properly.

It needs to identify the size of acceptable risk for the system, and the system risk can be controlled at an acceptable level within the scope. This paper first proposes a definition for equipment risk, and then formulates a cost-based equipment risk allocation optimization model. While the reverse failure tree researches pursue the same target, but at the designated risk target level, the costs based risk allocation model can provide risk allocation results with lower total maintenance costs for the system. Equipment risk is a characterization of loss uncertainty in an uncertain decision making process, in fact, any such characterization of the degree of uncertainty may be treated as a definition of equipment risk. Equipment failure is due to its natural attributes and is inevitable. Therefore, the study of equipment risk is not to eliminate the costs of risk, but to investigate the size of risk factors and their impact, express them in qualitative and/or quantitative methods, reduce the impact of the uncertain factors in decision-making process, and effectively control and avoid the risks. Risk-based equipment maintenance (RBM) is a maintenance optimization technology to control equipment risk. First, it needs to identify the size of acceptable risk for the system under study. If the system exceeds the acceptable risk level, reducing the risks of the various components thereby reducing the overall systemic risk, and the system risk can be controlled at an acceptable level within the scope. The primary means to reduce the components risk is to change the maintenance scheme such that at the designated risk target level, the risk control goal can be achieved through the optimal maintenance activities with the lowest maintenance costs. This paper first proposes a definition for equipment risk, and then formulates a cost-based equipment risk allocation optimization model. Finally, an example is given to analyze the model effectiveness.","Maintenance; Optimal model; Risk allocation","Control equipment; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Maintainability; Optimization; Process control; Risk analysis; Sensor networks; Targets; Wireless sensor networks; Acceptable risk levels; Decision-making process; Degree of uncertainties; Equipment failures; Equipment maintenances; Maintenance costs; Maintenance optimizations; Maintenance schemes; Optimal maintenances; Optimal model; Quantitative methods; Risk allocation; Risk controls; Risk factors; Risk targets; Risk-based; System risks; Uncertain factors; Risk assessment","Chen, Q.; School of Management, China",,,,9780863418365,,,"English","IET Conf Publ",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62449152212

In the first step, a questionnaire was designed to find Key Success Factors (KSFs) of the strategy of Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) by using the benchmarking technique. Criteria for questionnaire are carefully selected based on the Principles for securities market regulation set forth by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The KSFs of FSC were then used to conduct a survey in the State Securities Commission of Vietnam (SSC). The data collected by AHP-structured pair wise comparisons were constructed into a computer-based program called Expert Choice. The result shows that top priority choice for SSC is to build up financial and operational capacity for securities firms, which in turn, will best support other alternatives. Another finding shows useful techniques in strategic management widely applicable in the business world can perfectly fit into the not-for-profit contexts in a way that it can help SSC reassessing and remodeling current flows of work in developing the nascent securities market to be the market that protect investors, insure fair, effective, transparent environment and reduce market systemic risk. © 2007 IEEE.","Analytical hierarchy process; Benchmarking; Decision analysis","Benchmarking; Decision making; Financial data processing; Investments; Risk management; Strategic planning; Operational capacity; Securities market; Systemic risk; Analytic hierarchy process","Fong, C.M.; Department of Business Management, , Kaohsiung, Taiwan",,,,1424415292; 9781424415298,,,"English","IEEM IEEE Int.

To identify the genetic factors involved in lesion initiation, we studied a cross between C3H and the susceptible strain C57BL/6J (B6) on a hyperlipidemic (apolipoprotein E-null) background. METHODS AND RESULTS - Whereas a previous cross in mice fed a Western diet for 16 weeks revealed a very complex inheritance pattern with many significant lesion QTLs, the present cross, on a chow diet, revealed a single major locus on chromosome 9 (lod=5.0, Ath29*), and a suggestive locus on chromosome 4 (lod=2.6, Ath8). QTLs for plasma HDL, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were found on chromosome 1 over the ApoA2 gene. Neither of the lesion QTLs were associated with differences in plasma lipid levels or other systemic risk factors, consistent with the concept that genetic factors affecting cellular functions of the vessel wall are important determinants of atherosclerosis susceptibility. We generated a congenic strain for Ath29 and confirmed its contribution to lesion development. Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, is located in the Ath8 region and is known to be defective in C3H/HeJ mice. We constructed a congenic strain carrying a normal Tlr4 gene on the C3H Apoe-null background and found that the defective Tlr4 does not contribute significantly to lesion resistance during early lesion development. CONCLUSIONS - We identified one major QTL on chromosome 9, Ath29, for early lesion development in the BXH ApoE cross fed on a chow diet and confirmed its contribution in congenic mice. We have also determined that Tlr4 on the C3H ApoE background does not contribute to early lesion development. *Ath29 is referred to as Ath22 in Su et al 2006. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.","Atherosclerosis; C3H/HeJ; Quantitative trait locus","apolipoprotein A2; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; lipid; lipopolysaccharide; toll like receptor 4; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; ath29; atherosclerosis; blood vessel wall; C3H mouse; cardiovascular risk; cell function; cholesterol blood level; chromosome 1; chromosome 4; chromosome 9; chromosome identification; congenic strain; controlled study; disease course; disease predisposition; disease resistance; female; gene isolation; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic association; heredity; hyperlipidemia; inheritance; lipid blood level; lipoprotein blood level; male; mouse; nonhuman; null cell; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Apolipoproteins E; Atherosclerosis; Chromosome Mapping; Crosses, Genetic; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Lipids; Mice; Mice, Congenic; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Quantitative Trait Loci; Risk Factors; Toll-Like Receptor 4","Lusis, A.J.; UCLA School of Medicine, , Los Angeles, CA 90095-1679, United States; email: jlusis@mednet.ucla.edu",,,10795642,,ATVBF,"17916774","English","Arterioscler.

Results: Initial evaluation revealed the presence of an area of scleral melt and epithelial defect with an underlying calcific plaque over the necrotic area in the nasal conjunctiva. Fluorescein staining and pooling was present at the base of the defect, indicating epithelial loss, in two patients. No signs of infection were present, and screening for associated systemic risk factors for melting was negative in all cases. The patients refused to use any kind of donor tissue to cover the area of melting. An autogenous lamellar scleral graft harvested from the superotemporal quadrant and an advancement of the nasal tenon was used.

Design: Retrospective study. Methods: Records of all AION patients seen between 1989 and 2006 were reviewed. Patients younger than 50 years when initial visual loss occurred were included. Results: Of 727 consecutive patients with AION, 169 (23%) were younger than 50 years (median, 43 years; range, 13 to 49 years; 58% men; 93% White). Involvement was unilateral in 59% of patients and bilateral in 41%. At least one cardiovascular risk factor was found in 74% of patients. Hypercoagulable states and vasculitis were found in 8%. An underlying small or anomalous optic disk was found in 92% of eyes (210/230). Isolated disk anomalies (without systemic risk factors) were present in 26% of eyes. Final visual acuities were 20/40 or better in 64% of eyes and 20/200 or worse in 22%. Among patients with bilateral involvement, final visual acuity was similar in the two eyes in 70% of patients. Anemia and type I diabetes were associated significantly with fellow eye involvement. Recurrent AION in the same eye occurred in 6% of patients. Conclusions: AION in younger patients is not uncommon and represents 23% of AION patients in a tertiary neuro-ophthalmic service. Except for giant cell arteritis, ocular and systemic risk factors and associated disorders are similar to those described in older AION patients.

We therefore aimed to assess cardiovascular risk factor profiles of consecutive patients hospitalized with TIA/IS to stratify the risk of recurrent stroke according to the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) and of future cardiovascular events according to the ankle brachial index (ABI) as a marker of generalized atherosclerosis Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, 85 neurological stroke units throughout Germany documented cardiovascular risk factor profiles of 10 consecutive TIA/IS patients on standardized questionnaires. Screening for PAD was done with Doppler ultrasonography to calculate the ABI. Results: A total of 852 patients (57% men) with a mean age of 67±12.4 years were included of whom 82.9 % had IS. The median National Institutes of Health stroke sum score was 4 (TIA: 1). Arterial hypertension was reported in 71%, diabetes mellitus in 26%, clinical PAD in 10%, and an ABI ≤ 0.9 in 51%. An ESRS ≥ 3 was observed in 58%, which in two previous retrospective analyses corresponded to a recurrent stroke risk of ≥ 4%/year. The correlation between the ESRS and the ABI was low (r = 0.21). Conclusion: A high proportion of patients had asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease and a considerable risk of recurrent stroke according to the ABI and ESRS category. The prognostic accuracy as well as the potential benefit of various risk stratification scores in secondary stroke prevention require validation in a larger prospective study. © 2007 Steinkopff-Verlag.","Ankle brachial index; Ischemic stroke; Peripheral arterial disease; Risk prediction; Screening; Secondary prevention","aged; ankle brachial index; artery disease; article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; disease marker; disease severity; Doppler flowmetry; female; Germany; health care organization; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; recurrence risk; risk assessment; screening; stroke patient; transient ischemic attack; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Germany; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Observation; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke; Ultrasonography, Doppler","Diener, H.-C.; Dept. of Neurology, Hufelandstrasse 55, Essen 45122, Germany; email: h.diener@uni-essen.de",,,03405354,,JNRYA,"17668260","English","J.

To study how biomechanical forces regulate EC redox homeostasis, an important pathogenic factor in atherogenesis, we have cultured human ECs under 2 prototypic arterial shear stress waveforms, ""atheroprone"" and ""atheroprotective, "" which were derived from 2 distinct vascular regions in vivo that are typically ""susceptible"" or ""resistant"" to atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that atheroprotective flow decreases EC intracellular redox level and protects ECs against oxidative stress-induced injury. To identify the molecular mechanisms that control this cellular response, we examined several major oxidative/antioxidative pathways and found that atheroprotective flow upregulated certain antioxidant genes and strongly activated the transcription factor Nrf2. Using a strategy of small interfering RNA inhibition of Nrf2 expression combined with genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we determined the downstream targets of Nrf2 activation and identified Nrf2 as a critical determinant for the changes in endothelial redox balance exerted by atheroprotective flow. In addition, we showed that atheroprotective flow activates Nrf2 via the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, and this activation occurs differentially in atherosclerosis-resistant and atherosclerosis- susceptible regions of the mouse aorta. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hemodynamic forces present in atherosclerosis-resistant and -susceptible regions of the vasculature differentially regulate EC redox state and antioxidant potential. These alterations in redox homeostasis are primarily the result of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent activation of Nrf2 and its downstream transcriptional targets. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.","Biomechanical force; Endothelial cells; Nrf2; Redox homeostasis","phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; transcription factor Nrf2; antioxidant activity; aorta; article; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; biomechanics; cell culture; controlled study; endothelium; endothelium cell; enzyme activation; genetic transcription; hemodynamics; human; human cell; molecular dynamics; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; priority journal; shear stress; upregulation; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Atherosclerosis; Carotid Arteries; Cells, Cultured; Endothelium, Vascular; Enzyme Activation; Homeostasis; Humans; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Oxidation-Reduction; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Stress, Mechanical; Transcription, Genetic","Gimbrone Jr., M.A.; Office of the Chairman, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115-6110, United States; email: mgimbrone@rics.bwh.harvard.edu",,,00097330,,CIRUA,"17673673","English","Circ.

The aim of this retrospective study was to describe risk factors, clinical presentation, complications and treatment of portal vein thrombosis in a single-centre. Methods: Sixty-seven patients were identified in the electronic records from 1992 to 2005. All data were obtained from the patient records. Results: One or more risk factors (e.g. prothrombotic disorder or abdominal inflammation) were present in 87%. Symptoms were abdominalia, splenomegaly, fever, ascites, haematemesis, and weight loss. Abdominalia and fever occurred more frequently in patients with acute PVT. Frequent complications were splenomegaly, oesophageal- and gastric varices with or without bleeding, portal hypertensive gastropathy and ascites. Varices and bleeding were more frequent in patients with chronic PVT. Patients who received anticoagulant therapy more frequently achieved partial/complete recanalization. Patients with varices who were treated endoscopically in combination with β-blockade had regression of the varices. The overall mortality was 13% in one year, and was dependent on underlying causes. Conclusion: Most patients had a combination of local and systemic risk factors for PVT. We observed that partial/complete recanalization was more frequent in patients treated with anticoagulation therapy, and that regression of varices was more pronounced in patients who where treated with active endoscopy combined with pharmacological treatment. © 2007 Sogaard et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"alteplase; antivitamin K; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; heparin; long acting drug; low molecular weight heparin; nitrate; anticoagulant agent; abdominal disease; acute disease; adolescent; adult; aged; anticoagulation; article; ascites; bleeding; chronic disease; chronic pancreatitis; clinical feature; controlled study; electronic medical record; endoscopic sclerotherapy; endoscopic surgery; esophagus varices; female; fever; hematemesis; human; liver cancer; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; mortality; portal hypertension; portal vein thrombosis; portosystemic anastomosis; recanalization; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; splenectomy; splenomegaly; stomach disease; stomach varices; weight reduction; ascites; cause of death; comorbidity; echography; epidemiology; fever; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; liver cirrhosis; middle aged; neoplasm; portal vein; radiography; splenomegaly; survival rate; varicosis; vein thrombosis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anticoagulants; Ascites; Causality; Cause of Death; Comorbidity; Female; Fever; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Portal Vein; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Splenomegaly; Survival Rate; Varicose Veins; Venous Thrombosis","Sogaard, K.K.; Department of Medicine V (Hepatology and Gastroenterology), , 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; email: kks@dce.au.dk",,,1471230X,,BGMAB,"17697371","English","BMC Gastroenterol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548602436

We find that improved environmental management system and environmental performance result in reductions in firms' beta. Specifically, our empirical estimates show evidence of volatility clustering, short- and long-run persistence of shocks to the returns of the market and asymmetry in the leverage effect between negative and positive shocks to returns.

In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: eligible as collateral and not eligible, with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisions - which affects their return - and on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model. In a calibration exercise, it is shown how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority to have a preference for a gross system, like TARGET, over a net system, like EURO1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.","Collateral; Contagion; EURO1; European Union; Gross payment system; Intraday liquidity; Net payment system; Payment systems; Systemic risk; TARGET",,"Muoz, F.J.C.; Department of Economics, , 17071 Girona, Spain; email: franciscojose.callado@udg.es",,,1351847X,,,,"English","Eur.

European integration has possible implications for systemic risk, and poses various challenges for the current supervisory framework. The banks' responses to the changing competitive environment include the pursuit of strategies of diversification, vertical product differentiation and consolidation. European integration has implications for competition in banking markets, for the nature of long-term borrower-lender relationships, and for the relationships between ownership structure, technological change and bank efficiency.

Low ESS modulates endothelial gene expression through complex mechanoreception and mechanotransduction processes, inducing an atherogenic endothelial phenotype and formation of an early atherosclerotic plaque. Each early plaque exhibits an individual natural history of progression, regression, or stabilization, which is dependent not only on the formation and progression of atherosclerosis but also on the vascular remodeling response. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the remodeling of the atherosclerotic wall are incompletely understood, the dynamic interplay between local hemodynamic milieu, low ESS in particular, and the biology of the wall is likely to be important. In this review, we explore the molecular, cellular, and vascular processes supporting the role of low ESS in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling and indicate likely mechanisms concerning the different natural history trajectories of individual coronary lesions. Atherosclerotic plaques associated with excessive expansive remodeling evolve to high-risk plaques, because low ESS conditions persist, thereby promoting continued local lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, matrix breakdown, and eventually further plaque progression and excessive expansive remodeling. An enhanced understanding of the pathobiologic processes responsible for atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling might allow for early identification of a high-risk coronary plaque and thereby provide a rationale for innovative diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for the management of coronary patients and prevention of acute coronary syndromes. © 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,"atorvastatin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; nitric oxide; pravastatin; acute coronary syndrome; atheroma; atherosclerotic plaque; blood flow; blood vessel wall; cell differentiation; cell migration; cell proliferation; clinical trial; coronary artery atherosclerosis; gene expression; heart infarction; human; inflammation; lipid storage; mechanoreceptor; oxidative stress; priority journal; review; shear stress; signal transduction; smooth muscle fiber; thrombogenicity; vascular smooth muscle; vascularization; Blood Flow Velocity; Coronary Arteriosclerosis; Coronary Circulation; Coronary Vessels; Disease Progression; Endothelium, Vascular; Female; Humans; Male; Mechanoreceptors; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Oxidative Stress; Regeneration; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stress, Mechanical; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Vascular Resistance","Stone, P.H.; Cardiovascular Division, , Boston, MA, United States; email: pstone@partners.org",,,07351097,,JACCD,"17599600","English","J.

Based on the survey done, the lessons for other countries are organized under five topics: developing conforming mortgage product and market; extending the service to non-conforming segments; managing default and prepayment risks; managing systemic risk; and, developing an efficient intermediation process. The concluding remarks in the final section comprise the issue of right sequencing: that is, through what steps an MIS in a given country can be evolved toward a more market-based one that can deliver a higher degree of consumer welfare. © 2007, Global Social Science Institute.

Asias Street, 115 27 Athens, Greece","Shear stress represents the frictional force that the flow of blood exerts at the endothelial surface of the vessel wall and plays a central role in cell function and structure via managing several processes and contributes to the progress of atherosclerosis. It is a fact that interaction of blood flow and the endothelial surface is the critical interface for shear stress-dependent mechanotransduction. Vascular endothelial cells are equipped with numerous receptors in order to ""sense"" and react to mechanical forces elicited by shear stress. The intracellular signal transduction pathways and specifically the activation of protein kinases, is the second important molecular event underpinning cellular reactions to extracellular stimuli. MAPKs, comprising ERK1/2, JNKs/stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), and p38s, are serine/threonine protein kinases with a prominent role in cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis, by modulating the activity of downstream target proteins and various transcription factors, hence gene expression programs. Shear stress (nonlaminar or disturbed blood flow) plays an important role in atherosclerosis, where flow conditions are characterized by low or oscillatory shear stress. Atherosclerosis is promoted by decreased shear stress, as it is associated with a suppression of functions taking place on the vascular wall, such as eNOs production and endothelial cell repair. In the presence of systemic risk factors, there is an increased tendency for atherosclerotic plaque formation, which, once formed, further disrupt flow and forward growth of the fibroinflammatory lipid plaque. Targeted inhibition of many kinase types and subtypes is an immense research field as this may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to prevent atherogenesis. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Atheroprotective; Endothelial NO synthase; MAPK pathway; NADPH oxidase; Stress-activated protein kinases","2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 hydroxyphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; mitogen activated protein kinase p38 inhibitor; protein kinase; protein kinase inhibitor; protein serine threonine kinase; stress activated protein kinase; stress activated protein kinase inhibitor; transcription factor; apoptosis; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; blood flow; blood vessel wall; cell activity; cell differentiation; cell function; cell growth; cell regeneration; cell structure; clinical trial; disease course; drug research; drug targeting; endothelium cell; enzyme activation; friction; gene expression; human; hypertension; mechanotransduction; molecular mechanics; oscillation; protein targeting; review; risk factor; shear stress; signal transduction; stimulus response; vascular endothelium; vasodilatation; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Hemorheology; Humans; Models, Biological; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Protein Kinases; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Stress, Mechanical","Papavassiliou, A.G.; Department of Biological Chemistry, 75, M.

In this paper we investigate how systemic risk is affected by the structure of the financial system. We construct banking systems that are composed of a number of banks that are connected by interbank linkages. We then vary the key parameters that define the structure of the financial system - including its level of capitalisation, the degree to which banks are connected, the size of interbank exposures and the degree of concentration of the system - and analyse the influence of these parameters on the likelihood of knock-on defaults. First, we find that the better capitalised banks are, the more resilient is the banking system against contagious defaults and this effect is non-linear. Second, the effect of the degree of connectivity is non-monotonic, i.e. initially a small increase in connectivity increases the contagion effect; but after a certain threshold value, connectivity improves the ability of a banking system to absorb shocks. Third, the size of interbank liabilities tends to increase the risk of knock-on default, even if banks hold capital against such exposures. Fourth, more concentrated banking systems are shown to be prone to larger systemic risk, all else equal. In an extension to the main analysis we study how liquidity effects interact with banking structure to produce a greater chance of systemic breakdown. We finally consider how the risk of contagion might depend on the degree of asymmetry (tiering) inherent in the structure of the banking system. A number of our results have important implications for public policy, which this paper also draws out. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, macroeconomic volatility has fallen in developed countries. The purpose of this paper is to examine how these developments may have affected the nature of systemic crises. The paper also aims to discuss how central banks and other financial regulators might respond to these developments with a clearer, more rigorous, operational framework for their systemic financial stability work. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes analytical models developed at the Bank of England to assess how recent developments may have affected the probability and potential impact of systemic financial crises. The results from these models help to shape the practical framework for the Bank's financial stability work. Findings – The models suggest that financial innovation and integration, coupled with greater macroeconomic stability, have served to make systemic crises in developed countries less likely than in the past, but potentially more severe. Implementing a practical framework for financial stability work in response to this raises many formidable challenges. Practical implications – If individuals are risk-averse, the recent change in the profile of crises could lower welfare and would suggest that policymakers should place a higher premium on actions to monitor and mitigate systemic risk. The analysis also highlights the importance of differentiating the probability of risks from their potential impact. Originality/value – The paper will be of interest to academics interested in systemic risk, central bankers, financial regulators, and financial market participants. © 2007, © Company.","Economic stability; Financial risk",,"Kapadia, S.; Bank of EnglandUnited Kingdom; email: sujit.kapadia@bankofengland.co.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",15265943,,,,"English","J.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in this discrepancy largely remain uncertain. The hemodynamic or anatomical differences between the right and left coronary artery might play a key role. Physiologically, the right coronary flow is more uniform during the cardiac cycle compared to the left, which experiences a remarkable systolic decline accompanied by a significant diastolic increment. Thus, the oscillatory shear stress, that constitutes a proved atherogenic factor, is more intense in regions with disturbed flow in the left coronary system. Likewise, the wall stress is more oscillatory during the cardiac cycle in the left coronary artery. On top of that, several differences regarding the anatomical configuration (3D geometry, branching) and the phasic motion between the right and the left arterial system appear to play a critical role in the modulation of the local atherogenic environment. Therefore, it could be assumed that the flow characteristics along with the geometrical and phasic motion patterns generate an intense oscillation of the imposed to the arterial wall stresses, especially in the left coronary artery. Over the long-term, these augmented oscillatory stresses, in combination with the effect of systemic risk factors, might modulate a more atherogenic environment in the atherosclerosis-prone regions of the left coronary system. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We survey the benefits and risks of credit derivatives, particularly as the use of these instruments affects the role of banks and other creditors in corporate governance. We also hope to create a framework for a more general scholarly discussion of credit derivatives. We define credit derivatives as financial instruments whose payoffs are linked in some way to a change in credit quality of an issuer or issuers. Our research suggests that there are two major categories of credit derivatives: credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations. First, a credit default swap is a private contract in which private parties bet on a debt issuer's bankruptcy, default, or restructuring. For example, a bank that has loaned $10 million to a company might enter into a $10 million credit default swap with a third party for hedging purposes. If the company defaults on its debt, the bank will lose money on the loan but make money on the swap; conversely, if the company does not default, the bank will make a payment to the third party, reducing its profits on the loan. Second, a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a pool of debt contracts housed within a special purpose entity (SPE) whose capital structure is sliced and resold based on differences in credit quality. In a ""cash flow "" CDO, the SPE purchases a portfolio of outstanding debt issued by a range of companies, and finances its purchase by issuing its own financial instruments, including primarily debt but also equity. In a ""synthetic"" CDO, the SPE does not purchase actual bonds, but instead enters into several credit default swaps with a third party, to create synthetic exposure to the outstanding debt issued by a range of companies. The SPE finances its purchase by issuing financial instruments to investors, but these instruments are backed by credit default swaps rather than any actual bonds. In the Article's first substantive part, we discuss the benefits associated with both types of credit derivatives, which include increased opportunities for hedging, increased liquidity, reduced transaction costs, and a deeper and potentially more efficient market for trading credit risk. We then discuss the risks associated with credit derivatives, such as moral hazard and other incentive problems, limited disclosure, potential systemic risk, high transaction costs, and the mispricing of credit. After considering the benefits and risks, we discuss some of the implications of our findings, and make some preliminary recommendations. In particular, we focus on the issues of disclosure, regulatory licenses associated with credit ratings, and the special treatment of derivatives in bankruptcy.",,,"Partnoy, F.; Department of Law, United States",,,00096881,,,,"English","Univ.

The prevalence of DR in the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology (CURES) Eye Study in south India was 17.6 per cent, significantly lower than age-matched western counterparts. However, due to the large number of diabetic subjects, DR is likely to pose a public health burden in India. CURES Eye study showed that the major systemic risk factors for onset and progression of DR are duration of diabetes, degree of glycaemic control and hyperlipidaemia. Hypertension did not play a major role in this cross-sectional analysis. The role of oxidative stress, atherosclerotic end points and genetic factors in susceptibility to DR has been studied. It was found that DR was associated with increased intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness in type 2 Indian diabetic subjects suggesting that common pathogenic mechanisms might predispose to diabetic microangiopathy. Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric, has been shown to inhibit proliferation of retinal endothelial cells in vivo. Visual disability from DR is largely preventable if managed with timely intervention by laser. It has been clearly demonstrated that in type 2 south Indian diabetic patients with proliferative DR who underwent Pan retinal photocoagulation, 73 per cent eyes with good visual acuity (6/9) at baseline maintained the same vision at 1 yr follow up. There is evidence that DR begins to develop years before the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Our earlier study demonstrated that DR is present in 7 per cent of newly diagnosed subjects, hence routine retinal screening for DR even at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes may help in optimized laser therapy.

METHODS: We reviewed patient demographics, ocular findings, and clinical courses for 25 patients receiving systemic anticoagulation with warfarin who subsequently underwent vitreoretinal surgery. RESULTS: Patient ages ranged from 49 years to 81 years (median, 69 years). Indications for anticoagulation included atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, deep vein thrombosis, prosthetic heart valves, and hypercoagulable state. Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 36 months (median, 19.5 months). The international normalized ratio ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 (median, 2.0). Final vision after surgery ranged from 20/20 to 20/400 (median, 20/100). One patient who underwent scleral buckling and external drainage of subretinal fluid had an intraoperative subretinal hemorrhage associated with the drainage procedure. In all other patients, no intraoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Cessation of therapy with warfarin may not be necessary in patients receiving anticoagulation who are undergoing vitreoretinal procedures. Successful visual and anatomical results may be achieved after vitreoretinal surgery for patients receiving anticoagulation with warfarin. The management of anticoagulation should occur in conjunction with the patient's internist to allow a clear understanding of the potential systemic risks of cessation of warfarin treatment preoperatively. © The Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.","Anticoagulation; Complications of vitreoretinal surgery; Posterior segment complications; Vitrectomy; Warfarin sodium","warfarin; adult; aged; anticoagulation; cerebrovascular disease; clinical article; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; demography; disease course; drug indication; female; follow up; heart atrium fibrillation; heart valve prosthesis; human; hypercoagulability; international normalized ratio; male; retina hemorrhage; retina surgery; review; sclera buckling procedure; subretinal fluid; surgical drainage; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Cryotherapy; Eye Diseases; Female; Humans; International Normalized Ratio; Male; Middle Aged; Retinal Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Scleral Buckling; Thrombophilia; Venous Thrombosis; Vitrectomy; Vitreous Body; Warfarin","Fu, A.D.185 Berry Street, #130, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States; email: adfu@westcoastretina.com",,,0275004X,,RETID,"17460583","English","Retina",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947184831

The incidence is significant higher after resections of the rectum compared to anastomoses of the colon. The development of insufficiencies might be increased depending on defined local or systemic risk factors, but hardly cannot be predicted for individual cases. Clinical symptoms depend on volume and site of the leakage, mostly between day 3 and day 7 after surgery. Further therapy results after early diagnosis by endoscopy, colon contrast imaging, or CAT-Scan. After establishment of diagnosis, the decision on further management must be made individually regarding the special situation of the individual patient. In smaller, well-drained leakages, conservative treatment might be sufficient. Local abscesses might be drained interventionally. In doubtful situations or in cases with peritonitis, early relaparotomies are required. The operative management is decided knowing the intraoperative situs. Leakages must be drained, and in most of the cases a consequent peritoneal lavage will be necessary. When insufficiencies are diagnosed very early, treatment by suture might be possible. Is the situation caused by compromised circulation, further resection with or without consecutive anastomosis might be necessary. Diversion colostomy should be used as the treatment of choice in all high risk patients or in complicated local situations promising better outcomes and allowing relaparotomies for repeated lavages.

Because the Agency utilizes exposure information to estimate local and systemic risks associated with chemical contact, the focus of dermal exposure includes absorption of a chemical through the skin and its distribution to one or more target organs where it may exert a toxic action (Fig. 1). The anatomical site of contact is directly related to the activity being performed at the time of exposure.

Design/methodology/approach-The paper first surveys the quantitative importance of the UCBs in India, and their key performance indicators. Various official reports by the country’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and other relevant organizations are used extensively. The paper then identifies key areas of reforms, centering primarily on the current business model, governance and regulation practices, and capital adequacy. It then argues for a change in a paradigm shift by the UCBs, and how better governance and regulatory structure can assist this shift. Findings-The paper finds that if the UCBs are to remain relevant and play a significant developmental role in India, they will require same quality of governance and regulation as well as professionalism and modernization as the mainstream commercial banks. The governance and regulatory structures need to be brought in conformity with India’s current and prospective economic structure; and relevant laws modernized. This requires a paradigm shift in the role of UCBs. Research limitations/implications-The research has been based primarily on secondary sources, particularly various reports by the RBI, the country’s Central Bank. Better understanding of the reasons for differences between well-governed and financially sound UCBs on one hand, and those that are not, requires focused interviews and more searching examination of the operating environment and financial statements of a sample of the UCBs. This could be the next stage of research. Originality/value-This paper represents a part of public debate on ways of integrating the UCBs into the mainstream banking sector. This is an important public policy issue as even though the UCBs represent relatively small proportion of the total banking assets, they still represent a systemic risk to India’s financial system, and without reforming them, broad-based economic growth would be difficult to achieve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Banks; Co-operative organizations; Governance; India; Regulation",,"Asher, M.G.; LKY School of Public Policy, Singapore; email: sppasher@nus.edu.sg",,,13581988,,,,"English","J.

However, despite such advances, these diseases remain highly prevalent in industrialized nations, and the recent increase in obesity and diabetes, especially in children, forecasts a resurgence in the incidence of atherosclerosis-associated morbidity. Over the last three decades, the field has rediscovered the critical role that inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. An important component of inflammation is the emigration of leukocytes from the blood into tissues. The vascular endothelium, being situated at the interface between the blood and tissues, has important regulatory functions in atherosclerosis. In normal arteries, the endothelium has homeostatic functions, including nonadhesive and antithrombotic properties, and it provides a barrier to plasma protein and lipoprotein extravasation (1). Endothelial cells (ECs) are not a passive impermeable “Teflon-like” lining, but are active cells, which respond to diverse blood-and tissue-derived stimuli. For example, in response to the repertoire of local cytokines and modified lipoprotein components, ECs synthesize and present molecules that regulate the recruitment of distinct leukocyte subpopulations to atherosclerotic lesions. Profound and diverse changes in EC phenotype in response to different cytokines have been referred to as EC activation (2). ECs also can respond to external mechanical forces, including hemodynamic forces of blood (3). This is probably why atherosclerotic lesions initially form at sites of arterial branches and curvatures. These regions have unique hemodynamics and EC gene expression patterns that influence signaling, the cellular composition of intimal cells, and responses to systemic risk factors for atherosclerosis © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009.",,,"Cybulsky, M.I.; Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Canada",,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511546198; 0521853761; 9780521853767,,,"English","Endothelial Biomedicine",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928865587

In particular, this method has been well applied to spatially defined units, such as a production plant, a treatment facility, and a contaminated site. However, the management strategies based on the risk information will be more efficient if the comprehensive picture of total risks from all kinds of sources is depicted. In principle, the total risks can be obtained when all risk sources are assessed individually. Apparently, this approach demands huge amount of efforts. This study develops a methodology that combines substance flow and risk estimation to facilitate examination of risk in a systemic way and provide comprehensive understanding of risk generation and distribution corresponding to flows of substances in the anthroposphere and the environment. Substance flow analysis (SFA) and HRA method is integrated to produce a systemic risk assessment method, from which substance management schemes can be derived. In this study, the chromium cycle in Taiwan is used as an example to demonstrate the method, by which the associated substance flow in the economy and the risk caused by the substance in the environmental system is determined. The concentrations of pollutants in the environmental media, the resultant risks and hazard quotients are calculated with the widely-used CalTOX multimedia model. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This gives banks incentives to herd and increases the risk that many banks may fail together. The ex-post optimal regulation may thus be time-inconsistent or sub-optimal from an ex-ante standpoint.

To identify independent predictors of death and nonfatal MI, all available parameters were evaluated. Systemic surgical risk stratification systems such as the EuroSCORE and Parsonnet score were included in the analysis. Clinical information at 9 months was available in 98% of patients (median follow-up 26.3 months). During this period, death/MI occurred in 42 patients (13%). Of the 5 deaths, 4 were related to cardiac and 1 to noncardiac causes. By multivariate Cox regression analysis, a high EuroSCORE (≥6; hazard ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.6, p = 0.023), number of stents used (hazard ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 3.1, p = 0.042), and treatment with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (hazard ratio 8.6, 95% confidence interval 2.7 to 27.4, p <0.001) were independent predictors of death/MI. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of EuroSCORE and number of stents were 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.70, p = 0.023) and 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.70, p = 0.028), respectively.

With the widespread adoption of screening mammography, DCIS accounts for 20-30% of newly diagnosed breast cancers [18]. Until the publication of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-24 findings in 1999, which demonstrated the effectiveness of tamoxifen as systemic therapy for DCIS, primary surgery, lumpectomy or mastectomy, with or without radiotherapy has been the established treatment for this IEN [23]. Published series of untreated DCIS (where breast biopsies were read initially as benign) have demonstrated an approximate 33% risk of developing ipsilateral invasive breast cancer with follow-up periods of up to 30 years [48]. The risk factors for developing DCIS are the same as those for invasive breast cancer. Mastectomy is curative in 98% of patients with DCIS [45]. With clinically occult DCIS being increasingly discovered on screening mammograms, breast-conservation surgery, with or without whole-breast irradiation, has become an established alternative standard of care to mastectomy. Treatment of DCIS by excision alone has been shown to be associated with in-breast recurrence rates of between 14 and 43% with follow-up periods of between 3 and 10 years [45], with approximately one-third to one-half of the recurrences containing invasive disease [59]. Treatment of DCIS with excision and breast irradiation has been shown in several series to be associated with recurrence rates of approximately 20% at 10-15 years, again with one-third to one-half of recurrences containing invasive disease [58, 59]. Residual foci of DCIS that persist following breast-conserving treatment (BCT) are the likely cause of in-breast recurrences. DCIS is a multifocal but generally not multicentric process, as supported by the clinical observation that in-breast recurrences after BCT of DCIS generally occur in the area of the original biopsy site [26]. Examination of whole breasts have shown that the growth pattern of DCIS can be either continuous, suggesting unifocal origin, or discontinuous suggesting either multifocal origins or local extension of disease. Studies by Holland et al. have shown that poorly differentiated DCIS had a continuous growth pattern in 90% of cases, while well-differentiated DCIS had a multifocal distribution in 70% of cases [35]. In this series, 82% of patients with DCIS had more than a 5-mm gap of unin volved breast tissue between foci of DCIS. These studies have shown that DCIS is frequently extensive, and that complete surgical excision is often not possible even when clear margins are obtained. It has been estimated that total tumor clearance can be achieved in 66% of cases with a 1-cm circumference of clear margin around a mammographically detected DCIS less than or equal to 2 cm in size [34]. Increasing the uninvolved margin circumference to 2 cm beyond a mammographically detected DCIS can increase the success rate of total tumor clearance to 83% of patients [34]. It is highly desirable to achieve organ preservation in treating DCIS when clear margins can be obtained at lumpectomy. However, it is clear that even with the addition of postlumpectomy radiation therapy, patients retain a risk of developing an in-breast recurrence from subclinical DCIS or invasive cancer, a risk that increases over time. In addition, several studies have demonstrated an approximate 6% risk of developing a contralateral in situ or invasive cancer with a median follow-up of approximately 5 years in patients with DCIS [21, 23]. In general, the risk of developing a contralateral breast precancer or invasive cancer following a diagnosis of DCIS is estimated at 0.5-0.1% annually [32]. This risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer following a primary diagnosis of DCIS has not been refined according to whether the original DCIS was HR positive or negative. It is because of this ongoing local risk in patients who have been treated for DCIS that systemic risk reduction treatments are being utilized or evaluated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,,"O'Shaughnessy, J.A.; US Oncology Group, 3535 Worth St. Collins 5, Dallas, TX 75246, United States; email: Joyce.OShaughnessy@usoncology.com",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,3540282653; 9783540282655,,,"English","Breast Cancer and Molec.

Local risk factors, such as blepharitis, systemic risk factors, such as diabetes, and intraoperative complications, such as vitreous loss, further increase the risk of endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis prophylaxis, such as the use of povidone-iodine, has been shown to decrease the rate of endophthalmitis. The use of 5% povidone-iodine and irrigation in the fornices and use of preoperative antibiotics may decrease conjunctival bacterial load and in turn lower the rates of endophthalmitis. In addition, it may be important to apply povidone-iodine and antibiotics at the conclusion of a clear cornea cataract surgery. The role of postoperative subconjunctival antibiotic injection is not clear but has been associated with decreased ocular bacterial flora.

Materials and methods: The mammograms of 6156 consecutive patients were reevaluated for the presence of BAC. Four hundred eighty-five women having BAC were enrolled in the patient group. Additionally, randomly selected 500 women, without BAC constituted the control group. Hospital records of the participants were reviewed for parity, menopausal status, oral contraceptive agent (OCA) usage, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) usage, presence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, albuminuria and history of myocardial infarction (MI). Results: Prevalence of BAC was 7.9% on mammograms. Ninety-four women were aged between 40 and 49 years, 165 were aged between 50 and 59 years and 226 were over 60 years among BAC positive 485 women. A significant relationship was found for the frequency of BAC versus age and HRT usage in all age groups (p < 0.05). Similarly, significant relationships were also found for the frequency of BAC versus OCA usage, HRT usage, hyperlipidemia and diabetes in age group of 40-49 and in age group of 50-59, and for the frequency of BAC versus albuminuria in age group of 40-49, BAC versus history of myocardial infarction in age group of 59-59 and over 60 years (p < 0.05). The correlations were not significant for the relationships of BAC with OCA usage, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and albuminuria in women over 60 years (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Most benign findings like BAC are not routinely reported during mammographic evaluation. Our study showed that, presence of BAC on mammography was strongly related to advancing age. However, these findings may signify a systemic risk and can be used as precautious indicators for undocumented systemic diseases, especially in premenopausal women. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

METHODS AND RESULTS - One hundred seventy consecutive patients underwent common carotid artery scanning using high-resolution ultrasonography. A total of 150 patients could be analyzed off-line using ultrasonographic image processing, devised for individual measurement of IT, MT, and IMT. By univariate analysis, IT (range, 0.27 to 0.41 mm) was associated with age, whereas MT (range, 0.27 to 0.74 mm) and IMT (range, 0.49 to 1.12 mm) were associated with age, fibrinogen, and creatinine. Among atherosclerosis risk factors, hypertension was associated with thickness of all 3 layers, whereas smoking was associated with IT only. By multivariate analysis, IT was associated with age, hypertension, and smoking, whereas MT and IMT were associated with age, hypertension, and blood urea nitrogen level. CONCLUSIONS - Carotid IT is associated with smoking, whereas age and hypertension are associated with thickness of all 3 arterial layers.

The major risk factor is prolonged granulocytopenia. Most literature on the epidemiology and clinical impact of Aspergillus spp. infections concern patients with hematological malignancies, cancer, stem cell transplantation and solid organ transplant patients. However, evidence from recent literature indicates that Aspergillus spp. may cause invasive disease in other categories of patients without apparent immunodeficiency, including patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Clinical diagnosis of IPA in non-immunocompromised patients is difficult. Standardized diagnostic definitions, developed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group for research purposes in patients with cancer and in recipients of haematopoietic stem cell transplants, are not feasible for patient categories with an intermediate to low probability for acquiring IPA. In routine clinical practice, most Aspergillus isolates from non-sterile body sites do not represent disease. Invasive diagnostic procedures are often not feasible in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency and critical illness. The presence of systemic risk factors, or underlying predisposing lung disease or general debilitation, may enhance the clinical relevance of a positive culture. The finding of an Aspergillus spp. positive respiratory specimen in an ICU patient should not be discarded; pre-emptive antifungal treatment should be considered, while attempting to substantiate the diagnosis.","Intensive care; Invasive Aspergillosis; Outcome; Risk factors","article; Aspergillus; clinical practice; critical illness; diagnostic procedure; disease predisposition; disease severity; fungus isolation; granulocytopenia; hematologic malignancy; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; immune deficiency; incidence; intensive care unit; lung aspergillosis; nonhuman; opportunistic infection; organ transplantation; recipient; respiratory failure; risk factor; Aspergillus","Vandewoude, K.H.; Department of Intensive Care, , Ghent, Belgium",,,13693786,,MEMYF,,"English","Med.

We studied retrospectively the clinical presentation, laboratory test, imaging techniques, therapeutic interventions, and outcome of adult IS diagnosed in POVISA hospital between January 1978 and December 2005. Seventy-six cases of IS (48 male and 28 female) were identified, 29 tuberculous (TS) and 47 non tuberculous (NTS). The age at the time of the diagnosis was 47.1 ± 17.5 (mean ± SD). TS were the most frequent IS between 1978 ad 1991. All patients suffered inflammatory pain in the involved spinal segment, and 41% of them also presenting neurological signs. NTS were associated with a high frequency of fever (64% vs. 47.4%; p < 0.05) and leucocytosis (57.4% vs. 6.9%; p < 0.0001). Active extra-vertebral tuberculosis was found in 14 (48%) cases of TS. Systemic risk factors were identified in 25% of patients and a portal of entry was presumed in 28 (59.6%) NTS: surgical spinal procedures (11), cutaneous infections (5), vascular catheter infections (3), intravenous drug abuse (3), ginecological surgery (2), urinary infections (2), pneumonia (1) and pyorrhea (1). Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen, comprising 31 (66%) of the 47 NTS, follows by Streptoccocus spp. (6) and coagulasa negative Staphylococcus (3). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus were the remaining causative agents. Only 8% of infectious spondylodicitis involved the cervical spine. Epidural abscess were diagnosed in eight (8,5%) patients. TS was associated with greater diagnosis delay (22.5 ± 16 vs. 5.1 ± 3.1 weeks, p < 0.001), and more residual spinal kyphosis and/or scoliosis (65% vs. 17%, p < 0.002). Unfortunately, delay from onset to diagnosis of IS continues to be excessive, and exceeded to four months in the NTS. This fact is associated with more residual spinal deformity. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of IS in any patient that presents with spinal inflammatory pain, fever and/or increased of acute phase reactants.","Adults; Infectious spondylodiscitis; Postsurgical spondylodiscitis; Tuberculosis; Vertebral osteomielitis","Brucella abortus; catheter infection; diagnostic imaging; drug abuse; Escherichia coli; fever; gynecologic surgery; human; infection; intervertebral disk degeneration; intravascular catheter; Klebsiella pneumoniae; laboratory test; leukocytosis; osteomyelitis; outcome assessment; pneumonia; Proteus mirabilis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; review; risk factor; Salmonella typhi; skin infection; spinal pain; Staphylococcus aureus; tuberculous spondylitis; urinary tract infection","Gómez Rodriguez, N.; Unidad de Reumatología, 36201, Vigo, Spain",,,16678982,,,,"Spanish","Salud Ci.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749524823

Our analysis shows that incorporating systemic crises greatly affects asset allocation decisions, while the costs of ignoring them is substantial. For an expected utility maximizing US investor, who can invest globally these costs range from 1.13% per year of his initial wealth when he has no prior information on the likelihood of a crisis, to over 3% per month if a crisis occurs with almost certainty. If a crisis is taken into account, the investor allocates less to risky assets, and particularly less to the crisis prone emerging markets. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Adequate methodologies and models should be studied to support their decisions. In this work, an approach to evaluate the overall ""systemic"" vulnerability of a territory to extreme natural phenomena is presented. This approach is able to support decision makers in evaluating the key preventive planning actions to be exploited on a territory, taking into account both the specific possible damage that is likely to impact the different single relevant elements and the reduction in functionality of the overall territorial system caused by damage to a specific element. To achieve this goal, a graph-based approach is introduced to model the influences that each element may have on the functionality of the overall territorial system. The nodes of the graph represent all the relevant elements in the territory, whose failure or breakdown can seriously influence the functionality of the whole territorial system. The links represent the influences among the functionalities of these elements. An iterative algorithm to compute the consequent systemic vulnerability is also described.

The article discusses whether civil liability should be imposed on the leader of a consortium of underwriters (the lead or, more commonly, managing underwriter) and other underwriters of initial public offerings (IPOs) for misleading information in the offering prospectus. The justification of such liability is based on two new models that simulate the decision-making process of managing underwriters. The first model indicates that a statute imposing liability on underwriters plays a crucial role in solving the problem of hidden action by the managing underwriter, in which the degree of effort that the managing underwriter makes in performing due diligence is not revealed in the aftermarket. The second model shows that the managing underwriter acts strategically in setting the offering price and in allotting securities to investors, and that the law plays a central role in reducing the offering-related costs. This model describes the convergence of supply and demand in the bookbuilding method. The principal thesis of the study is that in the current structure of capital markets, the strategic behavior of the managing underwriter of a consortium of underwriters creates substantial costs through its method of distributing securities in the primary market and that this phenomenon justifies imposing civil liability on managing underwriters. In the first model, the moral hazard problem cannot be solved without statutory backing. In the second model, the managing underwriter cultivates a two-way relationship with potential investors during the course of marketing the offering. In this model, the managing underwriter determines the offering price and the allotment of securities to investors in a way that maximizes its profits. In equilibrium, only some of the regular investors perform valuations of the offered securities to the degree that enables efficiency in building a market-demand curve. The model indicates that imposing civil liability on the managing underwriter using the bookbuilding method can increase the efficiency of the allotment mechanism operation. Imposing liability on the managing underwriter is also expected to put some restraints on its strategic behavior in the after-market. Another aspect of efficiency that results from imposing liability, is that the managing underwriter's power to effectively supervise company directors, such as providing oversight of executive hirings and personal interest agreements, is strengthened. Imposing civil liability on managing underwriters is further justified by the fact that managing underwriters are the least expensive insurers, particularly in the distribution of systemic risks.",,,"Sher, N.; Department of Law, , Herzliya, Israel",,,10867872,,,,"English","Univ.

Most creditors are ""stayed"" from enforcing their rights while a firm is in bankruptcy. However, many derivatives contracts are exempt from these stays. Furthermore, derivatives enjoy netting and closeout, or termination, privileges which are not always available to most other creditors. The primary argument used to motivate passage of legislation granting these extraordinary protections is that derivatives markets are a major source of systemic risk in financial markets and that netting and closeout reduce this risk. To date, these assertions have not been subjected to rigorous economic scrutiny. This paper critically re-examines this hypothesis. These relationships are more complex than often perceived. We conclude that it is not clear whether netting, collateral, and/or closeout lead to reduced systemic risk, once the impact of these protections on the size and structure of the derivatives market has been taken into account. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Among the available credit risk models, Merton's equity-based approach is considered as a pioneering tool for measuring default risks. From the day it was developed by Robert Merton, it is being regarded as one of the primary model of assessing credit risk. In this model the default process is endogenous, and relates to the capital structure of the firm. The model presumes that the only source of uncertainty in equity prices is the uncertainty in the firm's net asset value. Therefore, the only risk considered is the firm specific risk. Ironically, the above market condition holds only when the market is efficient. The model developed in the present paper is virtually a modification of Merton's model. However, it is not subject to the limitation of that model. Therefore, the modified model will necessarily widen the scope of equity-based modeling ranging from a strict efficient market to an inefficient market. © 2005 Society for Policy Modeling.

Patients and Methods: Reliability of third molar probing depth (PD) was assessed for 41 patients by trained examiners. The data for the association between oral inflammation with periodontal pathology and systemic outcomes were derived from an IRB-approved study, ""Oral Conditions and Pregnancy."" Full mouth periodontal exams including third molars were conducted at less than 24 weeks of pregnancy. Periodontal status, moderate/severe periodontal disease (15 or more sites PD &lt;4 mm) was considered as a possible predictor of systemic inflammation and pre-term birth. The upper quartile of the extent of PD for third molars alone (PD &lt;4 mm) also was considered as a possible exposure variable for the same outcomes. Chi-square and t tests were used to determine statistical significance (0.05). Significant predictor variables were included in multivariate models. Unconditional logistic multivariate models were used to derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Reliability of PD within 1 mm was excellent, and similar for third molars and non-third molars. Data from 1,020 obstetric patients were available for analysis. Eighteen percent of the patients delivered preterm, at less than 37 weeks. Having moderate/severe periodontal disease excluding third molars, was significantly associated with preterm birth (P = .008). Results were more significant if third molars were included (P = .0005). With multivariate models moderate/severe periodontal disease at enrollment including third molar PD, was associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.6). If only the extent of third molar PD was considered, odds also were increased for preterm birth (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1, 5.2). If only the extent of third molar PD was considered at enrollment, odds were increased for serum markers of systemic inflammation, elevated serum CRP, and oxidative stress, 8-isoPGF 2α. Conclusions: Dental examiners could reliably assess clinical periodontal measures on third molars. Third molars should be included in studies of systemic outcomes associated with oral inflammation.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of postsurgical infections is a common practice in urologic surgery, as well as in endourologic procedures, both in at risk patients (local or systemic risk factors: age, immunological status, metabolic disorders, poor general conditions) or with a positive urine culture, but also in patients with urine previously sterile. As Gram-negative strains are the most common pathogens, it is reasonable to use a quinolone or a beta-lactam. Methods. One-hundred and thirty-one patients (range 21-89 years) underwent transurethral cystoscopy (52 cases), vesical catheterism (44 cases), extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (17 cases) and transrectal prostatic biopsy (18 cases). An antimicrobial prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg (22 patients, 16.8%), levofloxacin 500 mg (54 patients, 41.2%) and prulifloxacin 600 mg (55 patients, 42%) was administered. Results. Globally, the incidence of urinary tract infections during 15 days after surgery was 8.4% (11 cases out of 131): ciprofloxacin 9.1%, levofloxacin 11.1% and prulifloxacin 5-5%, respectively. The patients compliance with the prophylactic treatment was good or excellent in 122 cases (93.1%) and poor in 9 cases (6.9%). No major differences between antibiotics used iin prophylaxis were detected, keeping into account the limited size of the global population and subgroups defined by the endourological procedures. Conclusion. Prulifoxacin, with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, favourable pharmacokinetic properties and easy to use, can be considered a valid and well tolerated therapeutic option for the antibacterial prophylaxis in endourological procedures, both in hospital and in out-patient setting.","Ciprofloxacin; Endoscopic instrumentation; Levofloxacin; Prulifloxacin","amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antibiotic agent; cephalosporin; ciprofloxacin; fosfomycin trometamol; levofloxacin; metronidazole; prulifloxacin; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; adult; aged; antibiotic prophylaxis; antimicrobial therapy; article; bladder catheterization; clinical feature; controlled study; cystoscopy; demography; drug use; endourology; extracorporeal lithotripsy; female; Gram negative bacterium; high risk population; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; metabolic disorder; patient compliance; postoperative complication; postoperative infection; prostate biopsy; risk factor; surgical risk; urinary tract infection; urine culture; urologic surgery; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Biopsy; Cystoscopy; Female; Humans; Lithotripsy; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Prostate; Urinary Catheterization; Urologic Surgical Procedures","Prezioso, D.; Azienda Universitaria Federico II, Via S.

Whilst the UK banking market is a powerful influence in Europe, it is evident that exogeneity in each pairwise model lies largely with the European Monetary Union, but there is no significant evidence of oneway or dual causality between the EMU and the UK markets. The European Monetary Union has clearly achieved a strong degree of financial integration and remains the dominant influence on segmented European banking markets. It is apparent that the EMU banking market would benefit from UK membership by achieving greater liquidity, informational efficiency and global interaction. Unsystematic risk of the EMU banking market would be reduced with increased diversification, which would in turn reduce banking system risk and assist in financial regulation.

It suggests that careful scrutiny of recent Anglo-American campaigns, from Kosovo to Iraq, reveals a shared underlying concern: the management of globalised systemic risks. This implies an interesting continuity where one might expect discontinuity, given the different US administrations and strategic contexts involved. Policymakers, for instance, have consistently prioritised anticipatory proactive stances to avert probabilistic scenarios. Underpinning the analysis presented here is what sociologist Ulrich Beck terms the ‘world risk society’. Social sciences, notably sociology, have fruitfully incorporated risk theories into their research agendas. International relations, however, has largely not done so in a concerted fashion, despite its cross-disciplinary nature. This article demonstrates that Beck’s ideas in fact have great relevance to understanding the impetus, ethos and outcomes of contemporary war. © 2006, Sage Publications.

Methods: Newly or previously diagnosed patients with early to moderate open-angle glaucoma were recruited consecutively from 5 hospital-based university departments. Baseline parameters, including an assessment of peripheral vasospasm, haematologic, coagulation, and immunopathologic variables were obtained. Newly diagnosed patients were targeted for a ≥30% reduction in IOP, whereas previously diagnosed patients entered the study at a physician-defined target IOP. After baseline examinations, patients were followed at 4-month intervals with standard automated perimetry, short-wavelength automated perimetry, and confocal scanning laser tomography, and at 28-32-month intervals with stereo disc photography. If the patient had visual field progression with standard automated perimetry, a further ≥20% reduction in IOP was mandated. A standardized IOP treatment protocol, ranging from topical monotherapy to filtration surgery, was implemented. Results: A total of 258 patients (130 men and 128 women, median age 65.0 years) were enrolled. Baseline median values for visual acuity, visual field mean deviation, untreated IOP, and refractive error were 0.10 logMAR, -4.04 dB, 25.0 mm Hg, and 0.00 D, respectively. Approximately 30% of the patients were hypertensive, 16% had cardiovascular disease, 9% thyroid disease, 9% diabetes, 14% migraine, and 19% were smokers. The median follow-up was 5.3 years, with 148 (57.0%) and 51 (19.8%) patients completing ≥5 and >7 years follow-up, respectively. The cumulative visual field progression rate at 2,4,6, and 8 years was 11.3%, 21.5%, 33.1%, and 43.5%, respectively. Interpretation: We describe the study design and baseline patient characteristics of the Canadian Glaucoma Study and present some preliminary results. This long and close follow-up of a large group of patients will reveal the importance of several systemic factors for the progression of glaucoma.","Blood disorders; Glaucoma; Optic disc; Progression; Risk factors; Vasospasm; Visual field","antiglaucoma agent; adult; aged; article; blood clotting; Canada; clinical trial; comorbidity; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease course; female; follow up; hematology; human; immunopathology; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; medical research; methodology; open angle glaucoma; refraction error; risk factor; tomography; trabeculoplasty; vasospasm; visual acuity; visual field","Chauhan, B.C.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, , Halifax, NS B3H 2Y9, Canada; email: bal@dal.ca",,"Elsevier B.V.",00084182,,CAJOB,,"English","Can.

Diagnosis should be confirmed by preoperative core-needle biopsy histology, grading, hormone receptor status, and HER2/neu expression etc. in order to estimate risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy. If systemic risk is high, preoperative staging with bone scintigraphy, chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound or CT identify patients with metastatic disease, who will not necessarily benefit from radical surgery. Most patients with T1-tumors are candidates for breast conserving surgery (BCT), which, in combination with radiotherapy of the breast, is as safe as mastectomy. Margins should be free of tumor. Only multicentric disease, inflammatory breast cancer and unfavorable tumor versus breast volume are contraindications for BCT. Plastic surgery often allows resection of large tissue volumes with good cosmesis and minimal scars and may help to avoid mastectomy in many cases. Concerning axillary surgery, the resection of at least 10 lymph nodes has been considered standard. Axillary surgery is responsible for the majority of postoperative morbidity. In very small tumors and in the elderly with clinically negative axillae and small tumors there is some evidence that omitting axillary surgery may not reduce survival rates. In clinically node-negative patients with unifocal tumors not exceeding 5 cm sentinel lymph node excision is widely accepted although long-term survival data are still lacking. Multicentricity, inflammatory disease and extensive prior breast surgery and prior surgery of the axilla are contraindications for sentinel lymph node excision. © 2006 S.

A puzzling fact is the existence of widespread over-compliance of banks regarding national and international regulatory capital requirements. Some light is shed on this pattern by studying bank capitalization decisions using 1,267 banks from twenty-nine OECD countries. The effect of market pressure (competition) on bank capitalization is found to be positive, whereas the direct effect of regulation is ambiguous. Three points can be made. First, the effectiveness of regulation must be evaluated taking into account the - often overlooked - indirect effects. Secondly, the impact of regulation can be amplified by competitive forces when there are synergies between regulatory and market pressures. Such synergies seem to have played a key role in the widespread adoption and effectiveness of international regulatory capital requirements (the Basle Accord). And thirdly, the prospects for international regulatory convergence in any area are influenced by the interconnectedness (synergies vs. rivalries) between regulatory and market processes. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",,,"Bernauer, T.; Centre for Comparative and International Studies (CIS), Switzerland",,"Cambridge University Press",00071234,,,,"English","Br.

The coronary arteries are equally exposed to systemic risk factors; however, coronary angiography has shown a focal and uneven distribution of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that the nature of coronary arteries, such as the coronary dominance, is one of the local factors able to determine the morphology and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. The relationship between the coronary dominance and the distribution of coronary artery atherosclerosis; however, remains to be investigated. Subjects and Methods: A total 264 patients were enrolled for analysis. Using the ACC/AHA definition, the coronary dominance was assessed as either a right dominant, left dominant or balanced dominant artery. The degree of the coronary artery stenosis was obtained using a scoring system. By means of the sum of the numerical values in the three vessels, the total left anterior descending artery (LAD), total left circumflex artery (LCX) and total right coronary artery (RCA) scores were calculated. Results: Of the 264 patients, right, left and balanced dominance was found in 73.5, 16.3 and 10.2%, respectively. The total LAD, LCX and RCA scores were similar in the patients from all three dominance groups (p>0.05). The score for coronary artery disease were shown to be higher in the proximal and mid segments (LAD, p=0.000; LCX, p=0.002; RCA, p=0.041). Conclusion: The coronary dominance was not found to relate to the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease. The distribution of coronary disease in the three coronary arteries tended to cluster within the proximal and mid segments of the vessels. © 2006, The Korean Society of Circulation.","Atherosclerosis; Coronary circulation; Coronary disease","adult; aged; angiocardiography; article; atherosclerotic plaque; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery circumflex branch; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; female; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; left anterior descending coronary artery; major clinical study; male; right coronary artery; risk factor; smoking; South Korea","Kim, S.H.; Division of Cardiology, , Anyang, South Korea",,"Korean Society of Circulation",17385520,,,,"Korean","Korean Circ.

Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms, DNA sequence variations found within the complement Factor H gene, have been found to be strongly associated with the development of AMD in Caucasians. One single nucleotide polymorphism, Tyr402His, was associated with approximately 50% of AMD cases. We review recent developments in the molecular biology of AMD, including single nucleotide polymorphisms within the Factor H gene, which may predispose individuals to the susceptibility of AMD as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms that may confer a protective effect. Taken together these findings help to provide new insights into the central issues surrounding the pathogenesis of AMD. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The biomechanically distinct environments in these arterial geometries exert a protective influence via certain key functions of the endothelial lining; however, the mechanisms underlying the coordinated regulation of specific mechano-activated transcriptional programs leading to distinct endothelial functional phenotypes have remained elusive. Here, we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is selectively induced in endothelial cells exposed to a biomechanical stimulus characteristic of atheroprotected regions of the human carotid and that this flow-mediated increase in expression occurs via a MEK5/ERK5/MEF2 signaling pathway. Overexpression and silencing of KLF2 in the context of flow, combined with findings from genome-wide analyses of gene expression, demonstrate that the induction of KLF2 results in the orchestrated regulation of endothelial transcriptional programs controlling inflammation, thrombosis/hemostasis, vascular tone, and blood vessel development. Our data also indicate that KLF2 expression globally modulates IL-1β-mediated endothelial activation. KLF2 therefore serves as a mechano-activated transcription factor important in the integration of multiple endothelial functions associated with regions of the arterial vasculature that are relatively resistant to atherogenesis.",,"interleukin 1beta; kruppel like factor 2; mitogen activated protein kinase 7; myocyte enhancer factor 2; transcription factor; unclassified drug; angiogenesis; article; atherogenesis; biomechanics; blood vessel tone; carotid artery; cell activation; cell strain HL 60; controlled study; disease resistance; endothelium cell; flow; gene control; gene expression; gene overexpression; gene silencing; genome analysis; hemostasis; human; human cell; inflammation; mechanical stimulation; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein induction; signal transduction; thrombosis; transcription regulation; Base Sequence; Cells, Cultured; DNA Primers; Endothelium, Vascular; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors; Phenotype; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Small Interfering; Umbilical Veins","García-Cardeña, G.; Laboratory for Systems Biology, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115, United States; email: guillermo_garcia-cardena@hms.harvard.edu",,,00219738,,JCINA,"16341264","English","J.

Payment systems, which are the subject of much recent discussion, are an indispensable part of the infrastructure that supports the entire economy. Progress in the field of information technology (IT) has spurred new developments in hardware and software that affect payment systems. Of recent interest are issues of increasing payment risk and the severe situation of financial institutions in some developed countries. The costs associated with setup and operation of payment systems is high, and market participants expect efficiency. Many problems are associated with bond payments. The spread of delivery vs. payment (DVP) systems and IT-based transactions are also impacting payment systems. Links between payment systems are also important and have made concerns about systemic risk if timedesignated net settlements coexist with real-time gross settlements (RTGSs), which can alter outcomes or cause cancellations, thereby increasing systemic risk. If RTGSs and the net payment system are not operated by a single rule, this problem worsens. Unification of settlement systems, rules and dealings custom is critical.

This paper demonstrates the value of introducing interdependency analysis into various phases of risk assessment and management through application of the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM). The IIM estimates the cascading inoperability and economic losses that result from interdependences within large-scale economic and infrastructure systems. Based on real data and the Nobel Prize-winning W. Leontief economic model, the IIM is a computationally efficient. inexpensive, holistic method for estimating economic impacts. Three illustrative case studies are presented. The first and second illustrate how the supply- and demand-side IIM is used to calculate higher-order effects from attacks to vulnerabilities and implementation of risk management policies in large-scale economic systems. The final case study illustrates a more general use for interdependency analysis: to evaluate risk management options against multiple objectives. This study calculates a Pareto-optimal or efficient frontier of solutions by integrating a simplified model of the costs of recovery to the Power sector derived from open-source data with the IIM.

This paper examines how the general public perceives and assesses such information when it comes to food and food packaging risks. In the first part, the basic components of food risks are discussed and then compared with the perceptions of these risks. The main emphasis is on the risks from food packaging. The term 'perception' as used in cognitive psychology applies to the mental processes through which a person takes in, deals with and assesses information from the environment (physical and communicative) via the senses. The last pan of the paper deals with the consequences of risk assessment and risk perception for risk management and risk communication. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.","Phthalates; Risk communication; Risk perception; Semicarbazide; Systemic risks","phthalic acid; semicarbazide; article; food contamination; food industry; food packaging; food safety; genetically modified food; health hazard; information dissemination; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; risk management; Attitude to Health; Communication; Documentation; Environmental Exposure; Food Contamination; Food Packaging; Health Education; Humans; Mass Media; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Perception; Public Opinion; Risk Assessment; Safety; Uncertainty; Bovinae","Renn, O.; Interdisciplinary Research Unit on Risk, Seidenstrasse 36, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; email: Ortwin.renn@soz.uni-stuttgart.de",,,0265203X,,FACOE,"16227190","English","Food Addit.

Standard tools that regulators require banks to use for their internal risk management are applied at the level of the banking system to measure the risk of a regulator's portfolio. Using a sample of international banks from 1988 until 2002, I estimate the dynamics and correlations between bank asset portfolios. To obtain measures for the risk of a regulator's portfolio, I model the individual liabilities that the regulator has to each bank as contingent claims on the bank's assets. The portfolio aspect of the regulator's liability is explicitly considered and the methodology allows a comparison of sub-samples from different countries. Correlations, bank asset volatility, and bank capitalization increase for North American and somewhat for European banks, while Japanese banks face deteriorating capital levels. In the sample period, the North American banking system gains stability while the Japanese banking sector becomes more fragile. The expected future liability of the regulator varies substantially over time and is especially high during the Asian crisis starting in 1997. Further analysis shows that the Japanese banks contribute most to the volatility of the regulator's liability at that time. Larger and more profitable banks have lower systemic risk and additional equity capital reduces systemic risk only for banks that are constrained by regulatory capital requirements. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Review of AlphaCor data and case histories and literature review. Results: RPMs occurred with AlphaCor in 14 (9.3%) cases. We find significant associations with systemic risk factors (race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus) rather than ocular history, but perioperative management may also be related to risk of RPM development. Histology demonstrates a fibrovascular tissue resembling scarred corneal tissue. Similar histologic findings have been reported for other devices. Conclusion: Retrocorneal membranes and RPMs with earlier keratoprostheses have frequently been reported without specific identifiable causes. Diabetes is known to be associated with intraocular membrane formation. This study demonstrates that systemic factors affect the risk of RPM formation with AlphaCor. In cases identified as at greater risk of membrane formation, peri- and postoperative therapies such as steroids, non-steroidals, heparin or rTPA should be considered. In our series, several therapeutic and surgical strategies appear effective but recognizing patients at increased risk preoperatively and using preventive measures where indicated is likely to be key to minimizing the incidence of this complication.

Few studies have addressed the role that systemic risk factors play in the progression of atherosclerosis from one arterial tree to another. Methods: We studied 344 consecutive patients with suggested coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent combined coronary and carotid angiography during a 7-month period. Coronary and carotid disease was graded as absent-mild or moderate-severe based on the degree of stenosis of these vessels. Traditional vascular risk factors were compared for patients with moderate-severe CAD alone versus patients with moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease. Results: Moderate-severe CAD alone was found in 162 patients and moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease was found in 100 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension (P = .007, odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.9), history of smoking (P = .06, odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.4), and diabetes (P = .09, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.9-2.8) were associated with combined moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease. Patients with combined moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease were significantly more likely to have at least 2 of these 3 risk factors (P < .001) than patients with moderate-severe CAD alone. Conclusion: An accumulating burden of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are important in the progression of atherosclerosis from the coronary to the carotid circulation. © 2005 by National Stroke Association.","Atherosclerosis; Carotid disease; Hypertension","adult; angiocardiography; article; atherosclerosis; carotid artery; carotid artery obstruction; carotid atherosclerosis; cigarette smoking; comparative study; confidence interval; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; disease course; disease severity; female; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; sample size; statistical significance","Ehtisham, A.; Department of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, 1365 B Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States; email: asad.ehtisham@gmail.com",,,10523057,,JSCDF,,"English","J.

There remains empirical ambiguity, however, as to whether these cycles coincide. Recent papers suggest by their empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaults and credit spreads tend to co-move with macroeconomic variables. If true, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regulation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1933-1997 US data on real GDP, credit spreads and business failure rates to shed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate unobserved components framework to disentangle credit and business cycles. We distinguish two types of cycles in the data, corresponding to periods of around 6 and 11-16 years, respectively. Cyclical co-movements between GDP and business failures mainly arise at the longer frequency. At the higher frequency of 6 years, co-cyclicality is less clear-cut. We also show that spreads reveal a positive and negative co-cyclicality with failure rates and GDP, respectively. This pattern disappears, however, if we concentrate on the post World War II period. We comment on the implications of our findings for credit risk management.

The local application of molgramostim (recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) has been reported to improve impaired dermal wound healing. Since jaundice, one of the systemic risk factors for anastomotic dehiscence, causes significant impairment of anastomotic healing, we hypothesized that locally injected molgramostim could improve the healing of bowel anastomoses in bile-duct-ligated rats used as an experimental model for jaundice. Methods: Eighty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 4 groups of 20-22 animals each as follows: group 1 - colonic anastomosis only; group 2 - laparotomy followed 7 days later by colonic anastomosis; group 3 - common-bile-duct ligation (CBDL) followed 7 days later by colonic anastomosis (control group); group 4 - CBDL followed by colonic anastomosis with locally applied molgramostim. Laparotomy was performed under anesthesia in group 2 rats. In groups 3 and 4, laparotomy was followed by ligation and dissection of the common bile duct. After 7 days, colonic anastomosis was performed; in group 4 rats, molgramostim (50 μg) was injected into the perianastomotic area. On postoperative day 3, rats were killed, and the bursting pressures and hydroxy-proline levels measured. Two rats from each group were selected for histopathological examination. Results: The mean bursting pressure in group 4 was significantly higher than that in group 3 (37.8 v. 30.5 mm Hg [p < 0.01]). The mean hydroxyproline level in group 3 was significantly lower than that of the other groups (2.7 v. 3.1-3.5 mg/g tissue [p < 0.01]). On histopathological examination, specimens from group 4 rats showed an increased mononuclear cell population and a smaller gap on the anastomotic line than, those from group 3.

Arterial walls undergo regional disturbances of metabolism that include the uncoupling of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, a process that occurs to some extent in all cells and may be characteristic of blood vessels being predisposed to the development of atherosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels promotes vascular disease, we generated mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in the artery wall. Here we show that UCP1 expression in aortic smooth muscle cells causes hypertension and increases dietary atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol levels. UCP1 expression also increases superoxide production and decreases the availability of nitric oxide, evidence of oxidative stress.

The authors aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for infective keratitis in those over 60 years, the causative organisms, antibiotic susceptibilities, visual and tectonic outcome, and surgical intervention rate. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients aged 60 years and over admitted to the Sydney Eye Hospital with a diagnosis of infective keratitis, between September 1998 and December 2002. Results: 190 patients were identified with a mean age of 75.5 (SD 9.6) years (range 60-101). Local risk factors were found in 93.7%, and systemic risk factors in 27.9%. Organisms were cultured in 62.8%, and 7.9% had positive herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Perforation or severe thinning occurred in 36% overall, but in 80% with positive HSV PCR. Acute surgical intervention was required in 43.7%, with acute penetrating keratoplasty performed in 17.9%, and 8.9% required evisceration. Mean presenting visual acuity was 1.82 (SD 1.24), equivalent to 6/300, excluding 26.3% with vision of light perception (LP) or worse. Mean final visual acuity was 1.24 (SD 1.16), equivalent to 6/100, excluding 19.5% with vision of LP or worse (p<0.0005). Conclusions: The elderly represent a distinct clinical group in the context of microbial keratitis.

In order to overall manage the risks, the systemic risk theory is necessary for electricity retail enterprises, for this purpose, the definition of risk of electricity retailers is expanded from the income volatility caused by the price volatility to all the risk factors which lead to the enterprise value volatility when the enterprise takes part in the transactions in electricity retail market. The expansion of the definition is only the first step that forges ahead toward the whole risk management. Based on this expanded definition, adopting the interpretative structure modeling (ISM) technology and according to the commercial mode of electricity market and cognitional model of the risk environment, a systemic risk structure model for electricity retail enterprises is constructed. This risk structure model can be used as basic foundation in designing risk management system and working out risk strategy for electricity retailers, and provides theoretical basis in developing the structural model to meter the risks, therefore this systemic risk structure model is more significant than simple price risk theory.","Cognitional model of the risk system; Electricity retail market; Interpretative structural modeling(ISM); Power system; Systemic risk structure model","Electric industry; Electric power distribution; Electric power systems; Industrial research; Marketing; Risk assessment; Risk management; Cognitional model of the risk system; Electricity retail markets; Interpretative structural modeling (ISM); Systemic risk structure model; Electric currents","Han, J.-S.; School of Management, Nankai District, Tianjin 300072, China",,,10003673,,DIJIE,,"Chinese","Power Syst.

A basic theme is that capital standards should be less stringent for financial sectors characterized by greater market discipline and less systemic risk. Because market discipline is greater and systemic risk is lower for insurance than in banking, capital requirements should be less stringent for insurers than for banks. Similarly, because market discipline is generally greater in reinsurance (wholesale) markets than in direct insurance (retail) markets, capital requirements and related regulation plausibly need not be as stringent for reinsurers as for direct insurers. Current capital requirements and related solvency regulation for US and EU insurers and reinsurers are largely consistent with significant market discipline in the insurance and reinsurance sectors. Any federal regulation of US insurers/ reinsurers, harmonized regulation of EU reinsurers, consolidated oversight of financial conglomerates, and increased centralization of regulatory authority to supervise insurance and other financial activities should be designed with full recognition of the limited systemic risk and strong market discipline in insurance/reinsurance and avoid undermining that discipline. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

Although credit derivatives are important for hedging and securitizing credit risk - and thereby likely to enhance the sharing of such risk - some commentators have raised concerns that they may destabilize the banking sector. This paper investigates this issue in a simple model driven by costs of financial distress. The analysis identifies two effects of credit derivatives innovation - they enhance risk sharing as suggested by the hedging argument - but they also make further acquisition of risk more attractive. The latter effect, if dominant, can therefore destabilize the banking sector. The critical factor is, perhaps surprisingly, the competitive nature of the existing underlying credit markets. As these markets become more elastic the threat of destabilization increases. The paper discusses issues related to bank regulation within the context of the model. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

During the 1990s many developing economies underwent structural reforms, which lead to an improvement of those fundamentals. Hence, at that time, the stability of the domestic financial systems seemed basically guaranteed. However, this confidence was shattered by the outbreak of the financial crises of the second half of the decade. Some of them were certainly due to weak fundamentals in the affected economies. But other crises seemed to be engen-dered just because of wrong or misleading perceptions on the part of economic agents. The paper argues that a main source for these misperceptions is the way in which agents hedge their funds, on the basis of their assessment of the inner workings of the financial system.

This accelerated pace of change in the financial system reflects the shift from identifying and studying methodologies for loss provisioning and capital measurement and allocation to actually creating the necessary infrastructure and implementing these methodologies to respond to regulatory and competitive pressures. At the highest level, risk management and strategic planning are intertwined. Goals for growth, profitability, and mix of products and services can only be met by carefully planned risk taking. Risk can be idiosyncratic or systemic. Idiosyncratic risk is the risk of price change due to the unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market. In terms of unexpected loss, this risk may be virtually eliminated from a portfolio through diversification, as losses converge on their expected value. In this case, it is called diversifiable risk. In contrast, systemic risk affects an entire financial market or system and not just specific participants or obligors. In practice, financial institutions are unable to completely eliminate systemic risk through diversification, making it a non-diversifiable risk. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Antoniou, Diamanto Komboli, John Vrotsos and Zacharias Mantzavinos Introduction Periodontal diseases constitute infections related to specific pathogenic bacteria, which, in turn, attack and subsequently colonize the subgingival area. Several specific oral bacteria can be considered as representative for periodontal diseases and these include Actinobasillicus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Camphylobacter rectus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, all of which are associated with more severe forms of periodontal diseases (Genco et al., 1998). Periodontal diseases are now recognized as the bacterial infections which affect a large proportion of the general adult population of 25-75-year-olds, causing great discomfort, pain and tooth loss (Hugoson and Jordan, 1982; Miller et al., 1987; Brown and Loë, 1993). A very important feature of the disease is that these specific bacteria are capable of colonizing the subgingival area and infecting it in spite of the protective mechanisms of the host (Baker et al., 1961). The initiation and progression of periodontal diseases is determined and modified by specific local and systemic conditions, which are identified as risk factors. Genco (1996) has divided risk factors into two categories: (a) local risk factors, which are related to an earlier stage of development including dietary factors, osteopenia/osteoporosis, AIDS and stress, and (b) systemic risk factors which can be modified, including factors such as tobacco smoking and diabetes mellitus. The fact that the systemic risk factors can be modified is very important for the management of the disease. Risk factors are considered…. © Alexander-Stamatios G. Antoniou and Cary L.

The process begins by examining banking systems and focuses on market risks and the systemic risks associated with growing global economic integration and associated systemic interdependence. The model provides benchmarks for economic and regulatory capital for international banking systems using country, regional and global stock-market generated price index returns data. The benchmarks can then be translated to crosschecking capital levels for banks within those systems. For analytical purposes systems are assumed to possess a degree of informational efficiency and credit, liquidity and operational risks are held constant or at least assumed to be covered in loan loss provisions. An empirical study is included that demonstrates how market risk and systemic risk can be accounted for in a benchmark banking system performance model. Full testing of the model is left for future research.

A debate continues as to whether or not dominance by London is evident through the movements in interbank offered rates and whether any adverse shocks experienced there are felt through the other major Eurobanking centres of New York and Tokyo. This study finds that in the longer-term New York is the driver of both the London and the Tokyo interbank lending rates. The more important issue is that the interbank offered rates in London, New York and Tokyo show a long-term cointegrating relationship. Whilst Western banking is incestuous in terms of interbank lines of credit, support is nevertheless provided for rational expectations and market efficiency. However, cointegration also constitutes interdependence and in turn shows evidence of systemic risk (the threat of contagion) in these centres is provided.

Methods: To ensure the safety of this new approach, we have reviewed the personal series of a single surgeon using a standardized skin-sparing technique during 1989 to 2004. Results: Skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed on 225 patients, and standard mastectomy was performed on 1,022 patients. The age distribution was 8 years younger on average in the reconstructed group. The average follow-up for each group was 49 months. The local recurrence for each group was 1.7% and 1.5% (P > .80). The regional recurrence was 3.8% and 3.9% (P > .80). The average time to local recurrence was similar in each group (33.1 and 32.6 months, P > .80).

Methods: Retrospective non-comparative case series. Results: Six patients with bilateral epithelial defects after LAISK were part of a cohort of 605 patients undergoing bilateral LASIK at our center from December 2001 to April 2003. The mean age of the patients (5M:1F) was 28.5 ± 7.9 years, and the average pretreatment myopic spherical equivalent (SE) refraction was 7.3 ± 0.7 D (-4, -12.25D). An epithelial flap was present in 6 eyes and an epithelial defect with a mean diameter of 3 mm (2mm, 6mm) was seen in 6 eyes. In four patients the epithelial disturbance was bilaterally similar. All defects occurred in the inferior cornea and the epithelial flaps had the hinge positioned superiorly. None of the patients had ocular or systemic risk factors that could have resulted in this complication. A bandage contact lens was used in 6 eyes. At last follow-up of 5.5 ± 9.5 months (0.25, 21 months), unaided visual acuity was 6/9 or better in 10 eyes. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) was maintained in 8 eyes, while 4 eyes lost one line of BSCVA. Recurrent corneal erosions were not reported in the follow-up period. Conclusions: These patients represent a hitherto unrecognised group of individuals who appear to have a subclinical weakness of adhesion of the corneal epithelium to the underlying structures, which is not evident on clinical examination. This results in bilateral epithelial disturbances after LASIK. Appropriate management results in satisfactory clinical outcomes. Other options for treatment of the fellow eye of such patients include the use of a different microkeratome, release of suction during the reverse pass of the Hansatome microkeratome, and photorefractive keratectomy if the refractive error is low.","Epithelial defects; LASIK; Management; Microkeratome","corticosteroid; genteal; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; adult; article; best spectacle corrected visual acuity; clinical article; cornea epithelium; diffuse lamellar keratitis; eye surgery; female; follow up; human; keratitis; keratometry; keratomileusis; male; microkeratoma; myopia; refraction error; retrospective study; spectacles; surgical equipment; surgical technique; tonometer; treatment outcome; visual acuity","Rao, S.K.; Hong Kong Eye Hospital, 147K Argyle Street, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; email: skrao@cuhk.edu.hk",,"L.V.

M5R 1L5, Canada","Although the pathobiology of atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial process, blood flow-induced shear stress has emerged as an essential feature of atherogenesis. This fluid drag force acting on the vessel wall is mechanotransduced into a biochemical signal that results in changes in vascular behavior. Maintenance of a physiologic, laminar shear stress is known to be crucial for normal vascular functioning, which includes the regulation of vascular caliber as well as inhibition of proliferation, thrombosis and inflammation of the vessel wall. Thus, shear stress is atheroprotective. It is also recognized that disturbed or oscillatory flows near arterial bifurcations, branch ostia and curvatures are associated with atheroma formation. Additionally, vascular endothelium has been shown to have different behavioral responses to altered flow patterns both at the molecular and cellular levels and these reactions are proposed to promote atherosclerosis in synergy with other well-defined systemic risk factors. Nonlaminar flow promotes changes to endothelial gene expression, cytoskeletal arrangement, wound repair, leukocyte adhesion as well as to the vasoreactive, oxidative and inflammatory states of the artery wall. Disturbed shear stress also influences the site selectivity of atherosclerotic plaque formation as well as its associated vessel wall remodeling, which can affect plaque vulnerability, stent restenosis and smooth muscle cell intimal hyperplasia in venous bypass grafts. Thus, shear stress is critically important in regulating the atheroprotective, normal physiology as well as the pathobiology and dysfunction of the vessel wall through complex molecular mechanisms that promote atherogenesis.","Atherosclerosis; Cytoskeleton; Endothelium; Mechanotransduction; Nitric oxide; Shear stress; Smooth muscle cells","nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; artery wall; atherogenesis; atheroma; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; blood flow; blood vessel function; blood vessel reactivity; blood vessel wall; cell proliferation; cytoskeleton; gene expression; hyperplasia; inflammation; intima; laminar flow; leukocyte adherence; mechanotransduction; oscillation; pathogenesis; priority journal; restenosis; risk factor; shear stress; short survey; smooth muscle fiber; thrombosis; vascular endothelium; vein bypass; vein graft; wound healing; Animals; Arteriosclerosis; Humans; Shear Strength; Stress, Mechanical","Gotlieb, A.I.; Dept. of Lab.

Despite the many known risk factors and mechanism of damage, the principal treatment objectives in POAG still consist of reduction of intraocular pressure, which although straightforward in many cases, often leaves the clinician with the question of how far to pursue a sufficiently low pressure to prevent further damage. Other risk factors such as hemodynamic insufficiency due to vascular dysregulation and abnormal blood pressure are often overlooked in the day-to-day practice; their harmful effects for glaucoma are, it seems, more potent at night while the patient sleeps and when clinical investigation is most difficult. Although the status of autonomic nervous system is an important determinant of the systemic hemodynamic parameters, this issue is usually ignored by the clinician in the process of glaucoma diagnosis. Consequently, there is a lack of alternative therapies tailored to address associated systemic risk factors for POAG on a case and chronological basis; this approach could be more effective in preventing the progression and visual loss in selected glaucoma cases. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, the underlying mechanism of this heterogeneity is not well defined. Recent evidence suggests a role for the vasa vasorum (VV) in vascular disease. We hypothesized that there is a differential distribution structure of adventitial VV in different vascular beds. Hence, the current study was designed to characterize and compare the structure of the adventitial VV in the coronary and the peripheral circulation. Samples of vessels from different vascular beds were obtained from 6 female crossbred domestic pigs. The samples were scanned using micro-computed tomography, and the images reconstructed and analyzed to characterize VV architecture, including vessel wall area, VV count, VV density, intravessel spatial distribution, mean diameter of first- and second-order VVs and the ratio of second- to first-order VVs. There were significant differences in VV density among different vascular beds. Density was highest in coronary arteries (2.91 ± 0.26 vessels/mm 2, P &lt; .05, vs renal, carotid, and femoral arteries), intermediate in renal arteries (1.45 ± 0.22 vessels/mm 2, P &lt; .05, vs femoral artery) and carotid arteries (0.64 ± 0.08 vessels/mm 2, P &lt; .05, vs femoral artery), and lowest in femoral arteries (0.23 ± 0.05 vessels/mm 2). A similar pattern for the ratio of second- to first-order VV was also observed. Random intravessel spatial distribution of VVs was seen in all vascular beds. The current study demonstrates a differential structure of the adventitial VV in different vascular beds. This intra- and intervessel heterogeneity in VV anatomy is a phenotypic variability that might determine a differential local response to systemic risk factors and, thereby, variable propensity for vascular disease among different vascular beds. Atherosclerosis is a diffuse disease with differential expression among different vascular beds, inflicting a spectrum of vascular diseases. The majority of research efforts focus on the inner and medial vascular layers, which are in fact affected at the late stage of atherosclerosis. However, recent evidence suggests that the outer wall, including the adventitial layer and the vasa vasorum, plays a significant role in maintaining vessel integrity, contributing to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. The current article extends these previous observations. Using a novel imaging technology, micro-computed tomography, we demonstrate structural heterogeneity of the adventitial vasa vasorum among different vascular beds. This heterogeneity in VV anatomy is a phenotypic variability that might determine a differential local response to systematic risk factors and a concomitant variable propensity for vascular disease among different vascular beds.Furthermore, it suggests that anti-angiogenic treatment aimed at attenuating the VV neovascularization may have a potential preventive or reversal measure against the progression of atherosclerosis.",,"adventitia; animal model; animal tissue; article; blood vessel wall; carotid artery; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery; coronary blood vessel; female; femoral artery; nonhuman; peripheral circulation; phenotype; priority journal; renal artery; risk factor; swine; vasa vasorum; vascular disease; Animals; Arteries; Female; Reference Values; Swine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tunica Intima; Tunica Media; Vasa Vasorum","Divisions of Cardiovascular Diseasesemail: lerman.amir@mayo.edu",,,07415214,,JVSUE,"15337884","English","J.

Scott Fitzgerald) In distributed, complex socio-technical systems, risks increasingly originate from multiple sources, affect multiple agents in diverse ways, and thus become systemic. The traditional linear causal model of risk control and an individual decision-maker orientation is no longer adequate to contain such risks. This paper reports a detailed case study of a highly complex architectural project by the architect Frank Gehry and his firm Gehry Partners, L.L.C. Gehry and his partners successfully used the 3D representation software Catia to construct radical architectures with dauntingly complex geometric surfaces in spite of increasing systemic risks. Our findings suggest that, in order to successfully combat such risks, organizations rely upon organizing mechanisms characteristic of high reliability organizations (HROs). Our analysis also indicates that creating and maintaining a collective mindfulness is critical for risk control and mitigation in complex socio-technical systems. IT artifacts such as Catia, in combination with other social/technical elements such as skilled workers, contracts, and communication protocols, can enable the five cognitive processes underlying collective mindfulness: preoccupation with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations, sensitivity to operations, commitment to resilience, and under-specification of structures. © 2004, Association for Information Systems.

While it is well known that the portfolios of banks and non-banks, especially those intermediaries specializing in mortgage securitization or in specialized mortgage lending, differ in important respects, debate over alternative capital regulations has yet to recognize the implications of these differences, despite the increasing importance of non-bank intermediaries in risk-sharing markets. This paper uses a simple two-date discrete state space exchange economy with opportunities for moral hazard on the part of financial intermediaries to investigate the design of capital regulations to control systemic risk. Holding constant asset risks, we show that intermediaries that issue contingent liabilities may exhibit low or no risk of insolvency while holding significantly less capital than deposit-taking institutions because banks primarily issue claims that promise fixed payments in all states of nature. We also show that, rather than raising capital requirements, the control of systemic risk may involve lowering capital requirements and extending guarantees to liability-holders, without a necessary increase in expected subsidy payments, if such requirements account for shareholder incentives. Specifically, we analyze an example of regulatory policy in which lower capital requirements and an ex post penalty schedule reduce systemic risk by increasing the volume of tradable securities exchanged and by offering a credible mechanism by which intermediaries can signal the true riskiness of their portfolios to liability-holders.","Capital regulation; Government sponsored enterprise; Housing finance",,"Kupiec, P.; Banking Regulation Division, 700 19th Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20431, United States; email: pkupiec@imf.org",,"Springer Netherlands",08955638,,,,"English","J.

Although these elements affect blood vessels equally, clinically significant lesions develop at predictable locations, i.e., major branch points and bifurcations. This suggests that the development of clinically significant atherosclerotic plaques involves a complex interplay between vascular anatomy, vascular biology and hemodynamic forces. Cyclic strain, circumferential pulsatile pressure exerted upon a vessel wall, has been found to cause changes in endothelial cells that tend to disfavor atherosclerosis formation. Cultured endothelial cells have been shown to migrate, proliferate and alter cytoskeletal alignment in response to cyclic strain. Levels of macromolecules such as prostacyclin, endothelin, nitric oxide and tissue plasminogen activator have been found to be altered by cyclic strain. Additionally, cyclic strain has been shown to stimulate expression of cellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and intracellular second messenger systems such as the adenylate cyclase-cAMP, diacylglycerol-IP3, and protein kinase C pathways.

METHODS: Charts of patients who required single or multiple surgical debridements of epithelial ingrowth were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed to identify preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors. RESULTS: Fourteen of 22 patients had epithelial ingrowth that required a single surgical removal. These were mostly associated with the surgeon's learning curve, epithelial injury and enhancement by lifting the flap. Multiple surgical debridements were required in eight patients and some of these were associated with epithelial basement membrane degeneration and a history of type I diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Refractive surgeons should be aware of surgical and non-surgical ocular and systemic risk factors associated with both primary and recurrent epithelial ingrowth after LASIK to appropriately consent patients seeking refractive surgery. Type I diabetes may increase the risk of epithelial downgrowth in LASIK.",,"adult; aged; basement membrane; clinical article; debridement; degeneration; epithelization; female; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; keratomileusis; male; priority journal; review; risk factor","O'Brien, T.P.; Refractive Eye Surgery Service, 600 N.

We hypothesized that obesity, because of biomechanical and systemic risk factors, increases the risks of rotator cuff tendinitis, tears, and related surgical procedures. Methods: A frequency-matched case-control study was conducted. Three hundred and eleven patients who were fifty-three to seventy-seven years old and who underwent rotator cuff repair, arthroscopy, and/or other repair of the shoulder in a large hospital from 1992 to 2000 were included in the study. These surgical procedures were used as proxies for the risk of rotator cuff tendinitis. These patients were age and frequency-matched to 933 controls, who were randomly drawn from a pool of 10,943 potential controls consisting of Utah state residents who were enrolled in a large cancer-screening trial. Age-adjusted odds ratios were calculated with use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedural codes and body-mass-index groups. The data were stratified according to gender and age. Multiple linear regression analyses also were performed. Results: There was an association between increasing body-mass index and shoulder repair surgery. The highest odds ratios for both men (odds ratio = 3.13; 95% confidence interval = 1.29 to 7.61) and women (odds ratio = 3.51; 95% confidence interval = 1.80 to 6.85) were for individuals with a body-mass index of ≥35.0 kg/m2. Tests for trend also were highly significant for both men (p = 0.002) and women (p ≤ 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis also indicated a significant association between increasing body-mass index and shoulder surgery (beta = 1.57; 95% confidence interval = 0.97 to 2.17; p ≥ 0.001). Conclusions: There is an association between obesity and shoulder repair surgery in men and women who are fifty-three to seventy-seven years of age. The results of the present study suggest that increasing body-mass index is a risk factor for rotator cuff tendinitis and related conditions. Clinical Relevance: Individuals who are obese are at increased risk for rotator cuff tendinitis and rotator cuff-related surgery. This apparent risk increases with the degree of obesity. Level of Evidence: Prognostic study, Level II-1 (retrospective study).",,"adult; age; aged; arthroscopy; article; body mass; case control study; controlled study; disease association; female; gender; human; major clinical study; male; multiple regression; obesity; priority journal; rotator cuff; tendinitis","Wendelboe, A.M.; Public Health Programs, 375 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, United States",,"Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery Inc.",00219355,,JBJSA,"15069138","English","J.

These are symptoms at least as much as problems. We conclude first that under high systemic risks, the market equilibrium settles in favour of investor protection against price risk (through short-duration peso and dollar contracts) instead of protection against default risk. Second, the option value to litigate in the event of default, which is higher in dollar and foreign-jurisdiction contracts, may explain this equilibrium outcome and, more generally, the 'original sin'. Third, dollar contracts trump short-duration peso contracts as a risk-coping device; they are a better hedge against inflation volatility and are superior at mitigating the risk of loss given default. Fourth, according to a conservation principle, the mitigation of risk via the use of a coping mechanism allows additional risk taking in other forms, leaving total risk unchanged. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.",,"coping strategy; currency market; developing world; price dynamics; risk assessment","de la Torre, A.; World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington, DC 20433, United States; email: adelatorre@worldbank.org",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13670271,,,,"English","Int.

It is recognized that hemodynamic forces are largely responsible for dictating which vascular sites are either susceptible or resistant to developing atherosclerosis. In addition, a number of systemic and local factors also modulate the pathogenesis of the disease. By studying the development of atherosclerosis in mice, investigators have gained insights into the molecular mechanisms of this disease, although studies have largely focused on a single vascular site. Here, we review those recent studies in which vascular site-specific effects on atherosclerosis were reported when more than 1 site was examined. We assess the hypothesis that regional differences in the hemodynamic profile prime the endothelial phenotype to respond distinctly to such systemic risk factors as hypercholesterolemia, genetics, immune status, gender, and oxidative stress. Because a given treatment may differentially affect the development of atherosclerotic lesions throughout the vasculature, the sites chosen for study are critically important. By accounting for the complex interplay of factors that may operate at these different sites, a more complete understanding of the overriding mechanisms that control the initiation and progression of the atherosclerotic lesion may be realized.","Atherosclerosis; Hemodynamics; Risk factors; Site specificity","alpha tocopherol; amide; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B100; apolipoprotein B48; fenofibrate; gamma interferon; hypocholamide; interleukin 4; lipoxygenase; oxidized low density lipoprotein; probucol; ubidecarenone; unclassified drug; atherosclerosis; bone marrow transplantation; cardiovascular risk; gamma irradiation; gender; genetics; hemodynamics; human; hypercholesterolemia; immune status; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; priority journal; risk factor; short survey; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Arteriosclerosis; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Hemorheology; Humans; Male; Mice; Models, Animal; Models, Biological; Organ Specificity; Oxidative Stress; Risk Factors; Sex Factors","Getz, G.S.; University of Chicago, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637, United States; email: g-getz@uchicago.edu",,,10795642,,ATVBF,"14604830","English","Arterioscler.

Survival of free flaps is dependent on adequate blood supply. A 69-year old woman was scheduled for excision of a T3N0M0 oropharyngeal carcinoma, neck dissections and reconstruction with a free vascularized radial forearm flap. During the operation it appeared that the entire radial artery was almost completely obstructed by atherosclerotic plaques precluding microvascular anastomosis. Despite systemic risk factors certain artery types are more prone to develop clinically manifest atherosclerosis. There are no reports on the pathology of the radial artery in free flap reconstructions. In head and neck cancer patients severe atherosclerosis of the radial artery is very rare, but if present makes free radial forearm flap reconstruction impossible.

Lahar is the Indonesian term for volcanic ash, and lahar flows resulting from the massive amount of volcanic materials deposited on the mountain's slope posed continued post-eruption threats to the surrounding areas, destroying lives, homes, agricultural products, and infrastructures. Risks of lahar flows were identified immediately after the eruption, with scientific data provided by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other research institutions. However, competing political, economic, and social agendas subordinated the importance of scientific information to policy making. Using systemic risk analysis and management, this article addresses the issues of multiple objectives and the effective integration of scientific techniques into the decision-making process. It provides a modeling framework for identifying, prioritizing, and evaluating policies for managing risk. The major considerations are: (1) applying a holistic approach to risk analysis through hierarchical holographic modeling, (2) applying statistical methods to gain insight into the problem of uncertainty in risk assessment, (3) using multiobjective trade-off analysis to address the issue of multiple decisionmakers and stakeholders in the decision-making process, (4) using the conditional expected value of extreme events to complement and supplement the expected value in quantifying risk, and (5) assessing the impacts of multistage decisions. Numerical examples based on ex post data are formulated to illustrate applications to various problems. The resulting framework from this study can serve as a general baseline model for assessing and managing risks of natural disasters, which the Philippines' lead agency - the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) - and other related organizations can use for their decision-making processes.","Hierarchical holographic model; Impact-analysis; Lahar; Multi-objective trade-off analysis; Risk assessment and management","Decision making; Deposition; Economic and social effects; Geological surveys; Numerical methods; Risk management; Volcanoes; Destructive volcanic activities; Volcanic eruptions; Risk assessment; hazard management; lahar; risk assessment; volcanic eruption; conference paper; decision making; disaster; environmental impact; geology; health care organization; health care policy; Philippines; risk assessment; volcano; Asia; Eurasia; Philippines; Southeast Asia","Haimes, Y.Y.; Dept. of Syst. and Info.

Under this mandate, the so-called 'Friends of Fish' currently propose to adopt special sectoral disciplines on fisheries subsidies that directly and primarily aim at preserving fish resources. This paper examines whether and to what extent proposals by Friends of Fish can be justified, as a matter of law and policy. This paper first demonstrates that: (i) the current SCM Agreement may resolve fisheries subsidies issues to a considerable extent through dispute settlement; (ii) some limits of the SCM Agreement originate mostly from the generic imperfectness of the current SCM rules that apply equally to other sectors, rather than from unique features of the fisheries sector. Therefore, WTO Members may preferably move forwards negotiating on special disciplines only for residual matters that dispute settlement or cross-sectoral negotiations on SCM rules cannot effectively address. The Doha mandate cannot be construed as legally authorizing WTO Members to adopt special disciplines on fisheries subsidies as proposed by Friends of Fish, which would be a significant step beyond the trade-oriented WTO mission. As a matter of policy, such a move by the WTO towards sustainability would be an historic step for the WTO, but it would be justified only when proposed disciplines are accompanied by appropriate means to avoid or at least minimize an institutional systemic risk for the WTO. Current proposals by Friends of Fish seem to lack such a safety net. This paper concludes with several recommendations for WTO Members in dealing with fisheries subsidies issues so as to maintain a systemic balance and minimize an institutional risk for the WTO as a multilateral trading system.",,,"Chang, S.W.; Department of Law, , Seoul, South Korea; email: changsw@snu.ac.kr",,,13693034,,,,"English","J.

The number of the subjects who admitted to medical care in the first year of marriage was 23 and they had no risk factor for ED. Honeymoon impotence was the chief complaint in 18 of these patients. ED is mainly due to psychogenic factors at the first few years of marriage. Although organic factors are significant after long marriage intervals, psychogenic factors probably due to routine marital relations may also be involved. As a conclusion in addition to age and risk factors, the duration of marriage should be taken into account in the evaluation of these patients.","Age; Erectile dysfunction; Marriage interval","adult; aged; article; controlled study; erectile dysfunction; functional assessment; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; marriage; medical care; patient counseling; psychogenic impotence; risk factor; scoring system; time","Demir, Ö.; Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi, , Izmir, Turkey",,,13005804,,TURDA,,"Turkish","Turk Urol.

Single Photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is routinely applied for MPI allowing the characterisation of localisation, extent and severity of perfusion abnormalities. Several radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced to study myocardial perfusion enabling accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The documented prognostic value of scintigraphic parameters is of clinical importance to guide decision making in the work up of the cardiac patient. Event rates associated with a normal or low-risk MPI study have been shown to be <1%/year of follow-up. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of radionuclide imaging in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected CAD has been extensively demonstrated. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the most advanced scintigraphic imaging technique developed for in-vivo assessment of cardiac physiology and biochemistry. Assessing myocardial blood flow at rest and under stress conditions and calculating (regional) coronary flow reserve by N-13 ammonia, Rb-82 or O-15 water PET is the most sensitive means to detect any abnormal vasoreactivity which is already found at very early stages of the atherosclerotic process before any angiographic or clinical evidence of CAD. Flow tracers provide also quantitative information on the hemodynamic effects of any local, invasive (angioplasty) or systemic (risk factor modification) intervention.

Overview: The literature on the ocular and systemic effects of smallpox and smallpox vaccination is reviewed to provide the practicing optometrist with an overview of the issues involved in case management. Recent guidelines have placed additional ocular-related contraindications to receiving the smallpox vaccine. Risk factors for complications arising from smallpox vaccination are discussed. A discussion of the ethical implications is also presented. Conclusions: Knowledge of the signs and symptoms of smallpox infection, and of adverse effects caused by smallpox vaccination, can provide the necessary background to help eye care providers make appropriate diagnoses and referrals. Understanding ethical and legal/Constitutional questions surrounding the risk of outbreak and various vaccination containment strategies will help optometrists make informed decisions as health care professionals, patient advocates, and concerned citizens, as well as weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination, if it is offered to them.","Bioterrorism; Ethics; Eye infection; Public health; Smallpox; Vaccination; Vaccinia","aciclovir; antihistaminic agent; antiinfective agent; antivirus agent; cidofovir; disinfectant agent; idoxuridine; immunoglobulin; ribavirin; smallpox vaccine; trifluridine; smallpox vaccine; atopic dermatitis; bacterial infection; biological warfare; breathing disorder; clinical feature; conjunctivitis; disease association; disease course; disease predisposition; disease severity; drug efficacy; encephalitis; erythema; erythema multiforme; ethics; eye infection; fatality; fever; health survey; heart infarction; heart palpitation; herpes simplex; human; human rights; immune deficiency; infection control; infection risk; keratitis; malaise; mass immunization; myalgia; myocarditis; nephrotoxicity; pericarditis; politics; postvaccinal encephalitis; practice guideline; pregnancy; public health service; rash; revaccination; review; risk assessment; risk factor; skin manifestation; smallpox; thorax pain; treatment contraindication; treatment indication; uveitis; vaccination; vaccinia; Vaccinia virus; visual impairment; drug contraindication; eye disease; Health Care and Public Health; medical ethics; methodology; microbiology; pathology; public health; smallpox; vaccination; Health Care and Public Health; Ethics, Clinical; Ethics, Medical; Eye Diseases; Humans; Public Health; Risk Factors; Smallpox; Smallpox Vaccine; Vaccination","Chous, A.P.; Chous Eye Care Associates, 6720 Regents Boulevard, Tacoma, WA 98466, United States; email: Dr.chous@diabeticeyes.com",,,15291839,,,"14515981","English","Optometry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0642309908

Methods: In this prospective study, detailed medical history and slit-lamp examination were performed on all patients prior to intraocular surgery. Patients with local risk factors were defined as those with chronic blepharitis, conjunctivitis or discharge. Those with systemic risk factors were patients with diabetes, autoimmune, immunodeficient or skin disorders, asthma and those taking immunosuppressant medications. Conjunctival cultures were obtained prior to preoperative antibiotics and povidone-iodine. Bacteria isolated were identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined. Bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics were defined as multiresistant (MR). Results: Among the 207 patients enrolled in the study, 73 patients had local risk factors. Of these patients, 32 patients (44%) carried MR organisms, compared to 32 of the 134 patients (24%) without local risk factors (P = 0.0049). Thirty-two of 71 patients (45%) with systemic risk factors harbored MR organisms, compared to 32 of 136 patients (24%) without systemic risk factors (P = 0.0025). Seventeen of 93 patients (18%) who had neither local nor systemic risk factors had MR organisms on their conjunctiva. In contrast, 17 of the 30 patients (57%) with both local and systemic risk factors (57%) carried MR bacteria (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Patients with local and/or systemic risk factors are more likely to harbor MR organisms.

However, the role of cardiovascular risk factors for coronary remodeling has not been fully clarified. Methods: Therefore, we investigated the role of local plaque burden and systemic risk factors on coronary vascular remodeling in 25 patients (49 segments) with angiographically normal or minimally diseased coronary arteries by intravascular ultrasound. In an additional 12 patients without coronary atherosclerosis, physiological vessel tapering was determined and used to calculate the extent of remodeling in diseased segments. Results: An increase in local plaque burden was directly correlated with positive vascular remodeling (r = 0.54, P<0.001). However, cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension (P<0.001) and hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.03) were associated with reduced positive or even negative remodeling. Moreover, the total number of classical cardiovascular risk factors was a strong predictor for reduced positive remodeling (P for trend <0.001). In contrast, coronary flow reserve, a measure of shear stress imposed on the vessel wall, positively correlated with compensatory enlargement (r = 0.44, P = 0.002). By multivariate analysis, plaque burden (P = 0.001), hypertension (P = 0.001) and coronary flow reserve (P = 0.018) proved to be independent determinants of vascular remodeling of epicardial coronary arteries. Conclusions: Cardiovascular risk factors impair compensatory arterial enlargement and even predispose to shrinkage of epicardial arteries during the initial stage of atherosclerosis.

On the one hand, the approach is attractive because of the microbial nature of periodontal diseases but, on the other hand, evidence of benefit of these agents is equivocal for the majority of periodontal diseases and antimicrobials have the potential to cause harm. The disadvantages of systemic antimicrobials can be grouped under the headings of allergic reactions, superinfection, toxicity, drug interactions, patient compliance and, perhaps of most widespread importance, bacterial resistance. Mechanical debridement methods, including drainage of pus for acute periodontal abscesses, should be considered the first line treatment for most periodontal diseases. Systemic antimicrobials should be considered as adjuncts to mechanical debridement methods and, in chronic disease, never used alone as they can predispose to abscess formation. Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials may be considered in acute disease where debridement or drainage of pus is difficult, where there is local spread or systemic upset. In chronic periodontal diseases, adjunctive antimicrobials should be considered in early onset or rapidly progressive disease or in advanced chronic adult disease where mechanical therapies have failed or surgery is not a preferred option. Inadequate oral hygiene and tobacco smoking are contra-indications to the use of antimicrobials. The value of systemic antimicrobials, where other systemic risk factors co-exist, has still to be established. The role of microbial diagnosis and sensitivity testing for antimicrobial selection at this time must be questioned.","Antibiotics; Antimicrobials; Periodontal diseases; Surgical and non-surgical periodontal treatment; Systemic chemotherapy","amoxicillin; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; cephalosporin derivative; ciprofloxacin; doxycycline; metronidazole; penicillin derivative; penicillin G; quinolone derivative; spiramycin; tetracycline; tetracycline derivative; abscess drainage; Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; acute disease; adjuvant chemotherapy; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; antimicrobial therapy; chronic disease; conference paper; debridement; drug classification; drug contraindication; drug cost; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug hypersensitivity; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; drug safety; drug use; human; microorganism detection; mouth hygiene; patient compliance; periodontal disease; periodontitis; priority journal; pus; risk factor; smoking; superinfection; Adult; Anti-Infective Agents; Chronic Disease; Humans; Periodontal Diseases; Subgingival Curettage","Addy, M.; Division of Restorative Dentistry, Lower Maudlin Street, Bristol BS1 2LY, United Kingdom; email: Martin.Addy@bristol.ac.uk",,,1354523X,,ORDIF,"12974529","English","Oral Dis.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037670444

Although they are distinct from one another, the atherosclerotic and thrombotic processes appear to be interdependent and may be integrated under the term ""atherothrombosis."" It is now clear that plaque composition, rather than the percent stenosis, is a major determinant of plaque vulnerability. Plaque disruption seems to depend on both passive and active phenomena and is not purely mechanical. Inflammation (activation of monocytes/macrophages) is a major determinant of both plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity as they relate to plaque disruption. In one-third of acute coronary syndromes, there is, however, no plaque disruption but only superficial erosion of a markedly stenotic, fibrotic plaque. In these cases, thrombus formation may be exacerbated by a hyperthrombogenic state present in patients with certain systemic risk factors. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis and hemostasis. This dynamic organ regulates blood thrombogenicity as well as contractile, secretory, and mitogenic activities in the vessel wall. Some classic risk factors induce endothelial dysfunction by reducing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, increasing tissue endothelin-1, and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Vascular hemostasis, which is the maintenance of blood fluidity and vascular integrity, is achieved by counter-balancing the intrinsic clotting tendency of blood. As a consequence of the central role of endothelial cells in hemostatic control, a dysfunctional endothelium will generate a pro-thrombotic environment favoring development of atherosclerotic lesions and thrombotic complications. © 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,"endothelin 1; nitric oxide; acute heart infarction; artery endothelium; atherogenesis; atherosclerotic plaque; bioavailability; blood clotting; blood flow; blood vessel wall; cardiovascular system; cell activation; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery obstruction; coronary artery thrombosis; coronary risk; disease exacerbation; fibrosis; hemostasis; homeostasis; human; inflammation; macrophage; mitogenesis; monocyte; pathogenesis; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; review; secretion; signal transduction; thrombogenesis; thrombogenicity; thrombus; tissue level; vasoconstriction","Fuster, V.; Mount Sinai School of Medicine, , New York, NY 10029, United States; email: valentin.fuster@mssm.edu",,"Elsevier Inc.",07351097,,JACCD,"12644335","English","J.

The retinal disorders which may be mis-diagnosed as optic neuritis include Leber neuroretinitis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and Stargardt macular dystrophy. Retinal changes which evolve in neuroretinitis, and the pseudopapilledema in Leber heredity optic neuropathy are helpful in differentiating these disorders from optic neuritis. Stargardt macular dystrophy, a disorder associated with a variety of mutations, may be mis-diagnosed as psychogenic visual loss due to the early normal appearance of the retina, and the loss of vision over a period of weeks. The differentiation of optic neuritis from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), depends upon the initial appearance of the optic disc (in AION either hyperemia due to reperfusion, or swelling and pallor if total infarction has occurred). The authors have described children with abrupt loss of vision during renal dialysis, whose risk factors for AION included systemic hypotension and intra-ocular hypertension. Children with vigorous treatment of accelerated hypertension, and children with migraine and pro-thrombotic disorders have also incurred AION. Thus, AION should be suspected when acute loss of vision occurs in association with certain ocular and systemic risk factors. In children capable of cooperating for visual field examination, the typical change in AION is an altitudinal defect, while optic neuritis it is a central scotoma. The association of optic neuritis with multiple sclerosis, DeVic disease, and with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require special consideration in regard to treatment and prognosis. Acute loss of vision due to cerebral cortical insults involves a large differential diagnosis which includes vascular, metabolic and infective disease; as well as disorders causing transitory blindness such as seizures and migraine.","Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION); Cortical blindness; Optic neuritis; Retinopathy","acute disease; blindness; brain infarction; child; childhood disease; conference paper; demyelinating disease; dialysis; differential diagnosis; disease association; hereditary optic atrophy; human; hyperemia; hypotension; intraocular hypertension; ischemic optic neuropathy; Leber congenital amaurosis; migraine; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; optic nerve disease; papilledema; prognosis; reperfusion; retina disease; risk factor; Stargardt disease; thrombosis; visual cortex; visual disorder; visual impairment","Chutorian, A.M.; Department of Pediatrics, 68th Street, New York, NY 10021, United States",,"Revista de Neurologia",02100010,,RVNRA,"12599157","Spanish","Rev.

The latter can exist without causing systemic failure. In fact, recent research by Khoury (2001) demonstrated that systemic risk is largely a myth, as the probability of systemic failure is practically zero under all conceivable and realistic circumstances. An extensive simulation was used to ‘prove’ the hypotheses of the model. This does not imply, however, that the country risk under discussion in this chapter does not produce limited systemic risk, reflecting itself in a burst of the asset price bubble and/or in a significant reduction of liquidity. Bordo et al. (1995) referred to this as ‘pseudo systemic risk’. This is really what most researchers refer to as systematic risk. Country risk is the likelihood of a financial loss generated by macroeconomic, political, social and/or natural disasters within a given country. It is produced by natural or by manufactured (mismanagement) factors. Country risk is focused on the value of assets (portfolio and direct investment related) held by foreign entities within the country under examination, and is broader than sovereign risk. The latter deals with the inability of a sovereign borrower to pay back its debts to foreigners. The most recent suspension of payments on Russian debt (1998) is an example of sovereign risk, as were the suspensions of payments by a large number of countries in the early 1980s.

Exogenous risks associated with extreme events -such as macroeconomic shocks- have been separated from systemic risk, and now the idea of endogenous risk has been advanced. In some exceptional situations of no-coordinated interaction, endogenous risk may imply large losses to both banks and depositors.

Like other chronic diseases, the etiology of OA is multifactorial, and several local and systemic risk factors have been identified. Differences in the prevalence of OA may be attributable to both genetic and life-style factors.

This paper provides a descriptive analysis of the derivative practices of UK non-financial institutions, and attempts to evaluate whether these practices are consistent with value maximizing behaviour. Starting from the basic Modigliani and Miller Capital Structure proposition, more recent academic works on the subject are reviewed and analysed in the light of market imperfections. Unlike previously published UK based research, this study encompasses a broad spectrum of both derivative instruments and companies surveyed, and offers a wider picture of derivative activity. The paper starts with an analysis of potential benefits and pitfalls of derivative instruments in risk management. The results of a survey, sent to 629 of the 637 corporates listed in the FTSE actuaries as of 1 April 1998 are discussed and compared to existing surveys which report mainly from North American markets. As a whole, the derivatives activity of UK corporates appears to be fairly similar to that of Canadian and US firms, but is still limited in view of the potential benefits that can be derived from their use in risk management. Small firms in particular do not seem to take advantage of the products available to manage their exposure to financial price risks, and initial findings suggest that this is because of a lack of knowledge in derivatives. The results support a positive relationship between derivative usage and firm size and a strong positive correlation between interest rate derivatives usage and firm size. Results also confirm that a significant proportion of firms appear to take unnecessary chances on financial markets using derivatives, although as expected, UK corporates do not use equity derivatives. Finally, although large firms seem to have adopted fairly consistent practices towards derivatives' risk management; smaller firms have a far less consistent approach.

Superficial erosion of the stenotic plaque can be observed in one-third of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In these cases the presence of classic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and smoking favor a state of «vulnerable blood» or high risk. Increased thrombogenicity can exacerbate thrombus formation and is able to trigger an ACS. The vessel endothelium regulates contractile, mitogenic and thrombotic activities of the vessel wall. Risk factors impair both homeostasis and hemostasis of the vessel wall and promote inflammatory signals. Platelet and monocyte activation favors the expression of tissue factor (TF), thus triggering the coagulation cascade with thrombin generation and clot formation. Increased blood thrombogenicity linked to classic risk factors may be associated with circulating TF levels which are much higher than those observed in healthy subjects without risk factors. These observations not only emphasize the usefulness of aggressive management of risk factors but open a new avenue for future studies to devise therapeutic strategies to treat ACS by inhibiting TF expression.","Acute coronary syndrome; Risk factors; Tissue factor","thrombin; thromboplastin; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; blood clotting; blood vessel wall; coronary artery disease; coronary risk; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; endothelium lesion; homeostasis; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypercoagulability; inflammation; mitogenesis; monocyte; protein expression; review; smoking; thrombocyte activation; thrombogenicity; vascular endothelium; vasoconstriction","Sambola, A.; Servicio de Cardiología, Ctra. de Torrebonica s/n, 08227 Terrassa, Barcelona, Spain; email: asambola@yahoo.com",,"Ediciones Doyma, S.L.",03008932,,RCDOA,"14563295","Spanish","Rev.

Methods: We reviewed prospectively collected data for 175 elective infrarenal open AAA repairs performed over 6 years. A transperitoneal approach was used in 118 procedures, and a modified retroperitoneal approach was used in 57 procedures. The incisional modification, which facilitated repair in patients with massive obesity, scarring, or ventral hernia, included a higher, more posterolateral location in the ninth intercostal space. Risk factors that added to the difficulty of the repair included aneurysms with a short (<1 cm) or no aortic neck in 45 patients; large, angled or flared aortic neck in 32 patients;, tortuous and calcified iliac arteries in 6 patients; morbid obesity in 10 patients; low ejection fraction (15%-30%) in 14 patients; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with forced expiratory volume at 1 second less than 55% in 4 patients; previous laparotomy in 18 patients; previous left-sided colectomy in 11 patients; large right iliac aneurysm in 8 patients; large ventral hernia in 8 patients; pelvic irradiation in 4 patients; failed endovascular repair in 5 patients; and previous failed open repair attempt in 2 patients. Many of these factors occurred with significantly greater frequency (P = .04-.001) in the retroperitoneal group. All factors were correlated with outcome. Results: Despite these risk factors, overall 30-day mortality was 3.5% (retroperitoneal group, 3.8%), and mean length of hospital stay was 9 days (retroperitoneal group, 8 days). There was no significant correlation between mortality or length of stay and any of the mentioned risk factors (P > .2). Conclusion: In the era of endovascular aneurysm exclusion, open AAA repair is generally used to treat anatomically complex or difficult aneurysms, many of which are present in patients at high risk. Despite this combination of anatomic and systemic risk factors, the modified retroperitoneal approach facilitates treatment in difficult circumstances and enables open AAA repair to be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity.

The purpose of this study was to look at the prevalence of these antibodies in patients with RVO disease and no conventional risk factors. We specifically examined how APAs may affect the course of this disease. Methods: Twenty-four patients with the diagnosis of RVO disease were screened prospectively for APAs. All were free from risk factors for retinal vein thrombosis and other immunologic conditions. Patients were observed for a period of 3 to 12 months. Results: Lupus anticoagulant was negative in all 24 patients. Ten (43%) of 24 patients had anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs). All patients with ACAs were younger than 45 years of age, with an average age of 33 years. The average age of patients with no ACAs was 66 years. Comparison of the average age of the two groups showed a statistically significant difference. There was no statistical significance between the two groups for development of neovascular disease. Seropositive patients who developed neovascularization had elevated titers for an average of 11.8 weeks versus 3.3 weeks for those who did not have neovascularization. Neovascular complications generally began several weeks after the titers became negative. Conclusion: There was a significant prevalence of ACAs in young patients with RVO disease and no associated systemic risk factors. Seropositive patients who developed neovascular disease had elevated titers for more than 6 weeks. However, the role of these transient ACAs in retinal vein occlusion is still not clear and merits further study.",,"cardiolipin antibody; adult; age; aged; antibody blood level; article; clinical article; disease association; female; human; male; prospective study; retina neovascularization; retina vein occlusion; risk factor","Bashshur, Z.F.; Amer.

Insurance of individual yields does not cope efficiently with systemic risk and therefore fails in areas where crop yields are correlated across space. Area yield insurance provides an alternative and eliminates the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection associated with individual yield insurance. Area yield insurance therefore effectively copes with systemic risk. In this study, principles of area yield insurance were applied to yield data on small-scale cane growers in KwaZulu-Natal and used to calculate pure premium rates. The viability of a government-subsidised area yield insurance scheme for small-scale cane farmers was assessed in terms of affordability to the government, the farmers and private insurance companies. The empirical results obtained from this study indicate that such a scheme may pose great expense to the government and, as a result, may not be viable in South Africa.

There is, however, no generally accepted definition of systemic risk and the effectiveness and the economic consequences of various instruments of banking regulation that are intended to attenuate it are still only partially understood both theoretically and empirically.

Using data for 114 large banks from 16 countries worldwide, we study the impact of the IMF bailout announcements on bank security returns. The announcement that the IMF will provide a rescue package for a country has a positive impact on domestic bank stock prices in the countries receiving the bailouts, which supports the view that these bailouts help ameliorate systemic risk. Our results show that banks in the nonbailout countries generally experience either insignificant or negative abnormal returns, which is contrary to the view of opponents of IMF bailouts, who argue that these bailouts lead to moral hazard among international banks. Our results support the view that the reaction of investors differs from bank to bank, but consistent with the contagion and the heterogeneous creditor hypotheses, banks' stock price reactions are not proportional to their loan exposure. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

There appears to be a general trend towards greater volatility and risk in business and society. Risk management needs to be strengthened at both micro and macro levels, not least in the financial sector. The article deals with the management of risk for individual financial institutions and of systemic risk in the banking system as a whole through financial supervision and regulation. Management of risk in a single institution is exemplified by the risk management system of the Nordic Investment Bank in Helsinki. The article reviews in broad terms public policy responses to systemic risk in the banking system, and comments on the proposals for new rules on capital adequacy for banks from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Attention is drawn to the problems associated with reliance on credit ratings for capital adequacy requirements and to the dangers to financial stability that a strong link between risk ratings and capital charges implies. Pro-cyclical capital adequacy regime might lead to unacceptable volatility in the financial system.

Bothered by this conceptually flawed treatment approach we evaluated the impact of PMR on the treatment of women with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes. We identified 1164 patients treated from 1982 through 1999 with mastectomy. We reviewed the records of the 223 who demonstrated four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Of these 128 were treated by mastectomy only and 95 by PMR. The mastectomy-only group demonstrated a mean tumor size of 3.5 cm, a median of seven axillary nodes involved, and a median of 24.9 nodes harvested. The PMR group had a mean tumor size of 4.3 cm with nine positive nodes out of a median total of 23.3 harvested. The difference in mean tumor size was statistically significant (P = 0.01). The locoregional recurrence (10.9% vs 12.6%), distant recurrence rates (42.2% vs 35.8%), and 5-year survival (51% vs 55%) were not statistically different between the mastectomy-only group versus the PMR group, respectively.

To assess sequential chemical exposure effect on chemical cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of a toxicant, [14C]-pentachlorophenol (PCP) was topically administered in three porcine skin models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro) at 40 μg/cm2 with or without skin preexposure to benzo[a]-pyrene (BaP), a known human carcinogen and cutaneous cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) inducer. In the mass balance studies, BaP skin preexposure was found to enhance 14C absorption in all three models with detectable in vivo effect during the first several days. Total 8-h absorption was tripled by skin preexposure to BaP in the ex vivo (1.1 to 3.2%) and in vitro (0.20 to 0.66%) systems. As seen in the extended in vivo studies, total absorption was 50-57% regardless of exposure conditions, suggesting the prolonged observation period may conceal existing impact of potentially modified disposition processes, such as cutaneous metabolism, on systemic absorption. Skin preexposure to the skin CYP450 inducer BaP largely changed label penetration depth and distribution pattern in cutaneous tissues and decreased 14C concentration in skin and fat. Additionally, BaP preexposure altered 14C systemic tissue disposition, suggesting that altered cutaneous PCP disposition may eventually change the toxicity profile (cutaneous vs. systemic risk). The preliminary tissue distribution and systemic absorption data suggested that skin preexposure to BaP may considerably modify cutaneous biotransformation rate and thus deserves further investigation. The dermal model-dependent impacts of expected skin biotransformation manipulation by preexposure to chemicals such as BaP on cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of environmental toxicants such as PCP need to be considered in risk assessment.",,"benzo[a]pyrene; pentachlorophenol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; drug transformation; environmental exposure; female; isotope labeling; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; skin absorption; skin penetration; swine; toxicokinetics; Adipose Tissue; Administration, Cutaneous; Animals; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biotransformation; Carcinogens; Drug Interactions; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Pentachlorophenol; Risk Assessment; Skin; Swine; Tissue Distribution; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa","Qiao, G.L.; US-FDA, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, United States; email: GQiao@cvm.fda.gov",,,15287394,,JTEHD,"12227954","English","J.

Methods: 420 patients with hip OA and 398 patients with knee OA scheduled for unilateral total joint replacement in four hospitals in the southwestern part of Germany underwent detailed clinical investigations and a standardized interview in addition to radiographic analyses of ipsilateral and contralateral hip or knee joint and both hands. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of different possible risk factors with OA patterns (unilateral, bilateral and generalized OA) were calculated with logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: In 41.7% of patients with hip OA and 33.4% of patients with knee OA, an underlying pathological condition allowed a classification as secondary OA. 82.1% of patients with hip and 87.4% of patients with knee OA had bilateral disease. Generalized OA (GOA) was found in 19.3 and 34.9%, respectively (after adjustment for different age and sex distribution in the two patient groups; however, this difference was not any more significant). A positive association could be observed between hypercholesterolemia and GOA in knee OA patients as well as between serum uric acid and GOA in hip OA patients. Obesity and overweight were associated with bilateral knee OA, but not bilateral hip OA nor GOA. Discussion: Our innovative study design allows the non-invasive investigation of patient subgroups with established disease and a testing of relevant hypotheses in an appropriate setting. The data add to the evidence regarding the independant role of different systemic risk factors for OA. In an ongoing study the natural course of the disease of the contralateral, unoperated joint is currently being investigated in all recruited patients.","Clinical epidemiology; Hip osteoarthritis; Knee osteoarthritis","cholesterol; uric acid; adult; clinical trial; coxitis; diabetes mellitus; disease course; female; hip disease; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperuricemia; knee arthritis; knee osteoarthritis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; osteoarthritis; review; risk factor; total knee replacement; aged; article; cross-sectional study; Germany; health survey; hip arthroplasty; hip osteoarthritis; knee arthroplasty; knee osteoarthritis; middle aged; patient selection; Adult; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Cross-Sectional Studies; English Abstract; Female; Germany; Health Surveys; Human; Male; Middle Age; Multicenter Studies; Osteoarthritis, Hip; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Patient Selection; Risk Factors; Adult; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Germany; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multicenter Studies; Patient Selection; Risk Factors","Puhl, W.; O.

However, a generally accepted criterion for assigning skin notation does not exist.

The aim of the present paper is to review the preclinical and human experimental evidence supporting the esterification of BUD, and to discuss the clinical implications this may have on asthma and rhinitis treatment. Results: After inhalation, intact BUD binds primarily to available steroid receptors, and mainly excess (unbound) BUD is esterified. Esterification of BUD is a rapid process: within 20 minutes of inhalation in the rat of radiolabeled BUD, approximately 80% of radioactivity within the trachea and main bronchi was associated with BUD esters, primarily BUD oleate. After 4 hours, the proportion of BUD esters/total cellular BUD was typically 40 to 50% for lung, 70 to 90% for trachea, and only 10 to 15% for peripheral muscle. Comparative in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that esterification prolongs BUD's anti-inflammatory activity longer than that of corticosteroids that can not form esters. Clinical studies have confirmed the prolonged presence of BUD esters, as well as intact BUD, in human airway tissues: 6 hours postdosing, nasal biopsy concentrations of intact BUD were >10-fold greater than those of fluticasone propionate and at 24 hours BUD was detectable in threefold more biopsies than fluticasone propionate. The impact of esterification on airway selectivity of BUD has also been demonstrated in vivo and using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models. Conclusions: BUD is retained in airways as esters, a novel kinetic mechanism for synthetic glucocorticoids. In preclinical studies this esterification is correlated to a prolonged local tissue binding and efficacy, which is not found when the esterification is inhibited by an esterification blocker. Because less esters are formed in the systemic compartment than in airways/lung, the local benefit: systemic risk ratio may also be improved by this mechanism. BUD possesses favorable clinical properties, including its approved once-daily efficacy in asthma, which is probably in part attributable to esterification. However, a direct proof of the latter in patients requires effective and safe inhibitors of the esterification, which are not yet available. Therefore, evidence to support the therapeutic impact of esterification is still circumstantial.",,"budesonide; corticosteroid; fatty acid; fatty acid ester; fluticasone propionate; glucocorticoid; steroid receptor; antiinflammatory activity; article; asthma; bronchus; drug binding; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug selectivity; esterification; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; isotope labeling; nonhuman; priority journal; radioactivity; respiratory system; rhinitis; side effect; trachea","Edsbäcker, S.; Experimental Medicine, 725 Chesterbrook Boulevard, Wayne, PA 19087, United States; email: Staffan.Edsbacker@astrazeneca.com",,"American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology",10811206,,ALAIF,"12086369","English","Ann.

Theoretically, the introduction of this second-generation CB provides an opportunity for conducting discretionary monetary policy (though certainly not in its typical form).

Methods: One hundred and fifty-nine patients with mild diabetic retinopathy who showed one or more soft exudates were recruited. We selected the possible predictors on the basis of relevant factors, including concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and lipoprotein(a) in plasma, and serum level of von Willebrand factor and thrombomodulin. Results: Macular edema was not detected in 94 eyes; focal macular edema was detected in 46 eyes; diffuse macular edema was detected in 18 eyes; and cystoid macular edema was present in 1 eye. The plasma level of IL-6 concentration and the state of the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) correlated significantly with the severity of macular edema (odds ratios = 3.68, 1.70, respectively).

In addition, panel data regression procedures that allow for the identification of the appropriate statistical model are used. We argue the nature of the risks facing the Indonesian banking community calls for the addition of a systemic risk component to the Indonesian ranking system. The empirical results show that during Indonesia's stable economic periods, four of the five traditional CAMEL components provide insights into the financial soundness of Indonesian banks. However, during Indonesia's crisis period, the relationships between financial characteristics and CAMEL ratings deteriorate and only one of the traditional CAMEL components - earnings - objectively discriminates among the ratings.

However, many questions remain. Is it merely a question of improving the transparency of information in order to encourage better financial practice or of introducing much stricter rules while accepting the principle of limiting the international mobility of capital? If such questions arise, it is because there is no theoretical consensus over the dysfunction that was observed on the international financial markets in the 1990s. Paradoxically, this leads US to reconsider the work and theoretical heritage left to US by Keynes. Discussions about international monetary and financial governance recall the debate raised by Keynes, first of all in his Treatise on Money, about improvements to the gold standard system, and then when preparing for the Bretton Woods Conference.

Optometrists often encounter patients with ocular signs and/or symptoms suggestive of carotid artery disease, but criteria for eye care practitioners concerning when to order carotid studies are not well established. A retrospective study in an optometry clinic was performed to determine if certain ocular findings and associated systemic risk factors were associated with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (HSCAS). Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients examined in the optometry clinic at the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999 to identify all patients who had carotid studies ordered. Charts were then reviewed to determine the ocular finding that prompted the carotid study. Statistical analysis using an odds-ratio was performed to determine whether any ocular sign/symptom or systemic risk factor was associated with HSCAS. Results. Of 3822 patients, 48 (1.26%) had carotid studies ordered. Eight (17%) had HSCAS of > 50% and symptomatic patients were 1.6 times more likely to have HSCAS than asymptomatic patients. Patients with HSCAS were 1.8 times more likely to have retinal vascular occlusions, 1.9 times more likely to have normotensive glaucoma, 2.4 times more likely to have peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and 2.6 times more likely to be smokers, although none of these factors were found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS. However, the number of systemic diseases tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (HSCAS median = 3.5 and the non-HSCAS median = 2, p = 0.049). Conclusion. Although no single ocular or systemic risk factor was found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS, the number of systemic disease risk factors tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (p = 0.049). An extensive literature review was also performed to help establish guidelines for when to order carotid studies on the basis of ocular signs and/or symptoms as well as the presence of additive associated systemic risk factors.","Amaurosis fugax; Carotid artery disease; Cerebrovascular accident; Guidelines; Hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis; Ocular; Peripheral retinal hemorrhages; Retinal emboli; Risk factors; Stroke; Systemic","Blood vessels; Diseases; Optometers; Patient monitoring; Risk assessment; Retrospective analysis; Vision; adult; aged; article; B scan; carotid artery disease; carotid artery obstruction; cerebrovascular disease; cigarette smoking; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; peripheral vascular disease; priority journal; retina hemorrhage; retrospective study; risk factor; stroke; transitional blindness","Anderson, S.F.; Baltimore VAMC, 10 N.

Systemic risk reduction is the primary objective in the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication, as these patients have a high future risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Modification of cardiovascular risk factors accompanied by antiplatelet therapy is likely to improve overall survival, reduce myocardial infarction and stroke, and will, perhaps, also reduce the risk of ulcers and amputation at acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios. The second goal in the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication is to improve their walking capacity and community-based functional status. Supervised exercise training is the most effective noninvasive intervention to improve walking capacity, but may have elevated indirect costs. Among patients with disabling claudication who are candidates for invasive therapeutic procedures, angioplasty is cost effective in those with femoropopliteal stenosis or occlusion and in those with critical limb ischaemia and a stenosis. For all these therapeutic strategies there is a need to relate the costs to a relevant and comprehensive measure of effectiveness. Quality-of-life evaluation by using questionnaires exploring the specific problems encountered by patients with intermittent claudication in their daily life appear to be the most appropriate tool to evaluate the net result of a treatment. Cost-utility studies by combining pecuniary and quality-of-life evaluations provide information that is extremely useful to patients with intermittent claudication, regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare providers.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; antithrombocytic agent; beraprost; cilostazol; clopidogrel; colestyramine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; milrinone; naftidrofuryl; nicotinic acid; pentoxifylline; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; placebo; probucol; propionylcarnitine; prostacyclin; serotonin 2 antagonist; ticlopidine; atherosclerosis; bypass surgery; clinical trial; coronary artery disease; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; diet restriction; disease course; distress syndrome; drug efficacy; drug induced disease; drug safety; exercise; gastrointestinal toxicity; health care cost; health status; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; intermittent claudication; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral vascular disease; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; questionnaire; review; risk factor; stent; stroke; walking; Aged; Cost of Illness; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Intermittent Claudication; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Walking","Brevetti, G.45/A, Via G.

Since these two centers control access to international markets, and thus, are the conduit of systemic risk, they can establish both the rules for market access and the core regulatory and supervisory framework to deal with international systemic issues. The regulators of the two portals therefore play the fundamental international regulatory role.",,,,,"SAGE Publications Inc.",00027162,,,,"English","Ann. Am. Acad. Polit. Soc.

We argue that firm inter-dependencies, as measured by correlations of stock returns, provide an indicator of systemic risk potential. We analyze the dynamics of the stock return correlations of a sample of US large and complex banking organizations (LCBOs) over 1988-1999, and find a significant positive trend in stock return correlations. This findings is consistent with the view that the systemic risk potential in the financial sector appears to have increased over the last decade. In addition, we relate firms' return correlations to their consolidation activity by estimating measures of the consolidation elasticity of correlation. Consolidation at the sample LCBOs appears to have contributed to LCBOs inter-dependencies. However, consolidation elasticities of correlation exhibit substantial time variation, and likely declined in the latter part of the decade. Thus, factors other than consolidation have also been responsible for the upward trend in return correlations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although the coronary arteries are equally exposed to systemic risk factors, coronary atherosclerosis is focal and eccentric, and each lesion evolves in ah independent manner. Variations in shear stress elicit markedly different humoral, metabolic, and structural responses in endothelial cells. Areas of low shear stress promote atherosclerosis, whereas areas of high shear stress prevent atherosclerosis. Characterization of the shear stresses affecting coronary arteries in humans in vivo may permit prediction of progression of coronary disease, prediction of which plaques might become vulnerable to rupture, and prediction of sites of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods. To determine endothelial shear stress, the 3-dimensional anatomy of a segment of the right coronary artery was determined immediately after directional atherectomy by use of a combination of intracoronary ultrasound and biplane coronary angiography. The geometry of the segment was represented in curvilinear coordinates and a computational fluid dynamics technique was used to investigate the detailed phasic velocity profile and shear stress distribution. The results were analyzed with several conventional indicators and one novel indicator of disturbed flow. Results. Our methodology identified areas of minor flow reversals, significant swirling, and large variations of local velocity and shear stress -temporally, axially, and cirumferentially - within the artery, even in the absence of significant luminal obstruction. Conclusions. We have described a system that permits, for the first time, the in vivo determination of pulsatile local velocity patterns and endothelial shear stress in the human coronary arteries. The flow phenomena exhibit characteristics consistent with the focal nature of atherogenesis and restenosis.",,"artery rupture; article; atherogenesis; blood flow velocity; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery blood flow; endothelium cell; geometry; heart muscle metabolism; human; human tissue; humoral immunity; methodology; prediction; priority journal; pulsatile flow; restenosis; risk factor; shear flow; stress strain relationship; structure activity relation; three dimensional imaging; transluminal coronary angioplasty",,,,00028703,,,"12075241","English","Am.

Methods: Between August 1997 and October 2000, 9 eyes with CRVO were treated with intravitreal injection of tPA, 100 μg (50 μg/0.1mL), and paracentesis. After the injection, each patient was placed at strict bed rest in the supine position for 6 hours. Each patient was administered one baby aspirin daily. Best corrected visual acuity with Light House charts was obtained at each visit. A change of 3 or more lines of vision from pretreatment levels at 6 months' follow-up or a change in one level (ie, counting fingers to hand motions) was deemed significant. Results: All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Four of 9 eyes (44%) showed 3 or more lines improvement at 6 months. In this group, the average improvement was 7 lines. Two eyes showed 6 or more lines loss of vision at 6 months. Four eyes showed dramatic improvement in visual acuity within 1 month of injection. There were no adverse effects related to treatment. Three eyes subsequently developed retinal or anterior-segment neovascularization requiring panretinal photocoagulation; all were graded as ischémie CRVO on fluorescein angiography at baseline. Conclusion: Intravitreal tPA can be injected safely and easily. Local injection of tPA should spare the patient the serious systemic risks of intravenous tPA administration, such as stroke.

Recently, the third pillar-market discipline-has received greater attention as the increasing size and complexity of financial services firms has placed strain on the other two pillars, raising concerns about systemic risk. The idea of market discipline operating in a highly regulated and protected industry seems somewhat paradoxical. Bankers and their stakeholders factor the existence of a safety net into their decision making. One wonders how market discipline can exert much pressure in the safety-net environment. I explore that general question here by examining specific subdebt proposals. I find that only the proposals that rely on a strict rule employ something approaching market discipline. Proposals that involve regulatory discretion actually pertain more to the other two pillars of the banking support triad-supervision and regulation. In addition, we have strong reasons to expect that if a subdebt policy were adopted, it would involve regulator discretion.",,"banking; central bank; debt; financial services; United States","Maclachlan, F.C.; Department of Economics and Finance, , Riverdale, NY, United States",,,10861653,,,,"English","Indep.

Methods : A cross sectional study of diabetic retinopathy was conducted on 1,826 eyes of 913 randomly selected patients with type 2 diabetes in 9 central hospitals in Aomori Prefecture and the surrounding district. Retinopathy levels and maculopathy were assessed by binocular funduscopy, fundus photography and, if necessary, by fluoreseein angiography. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent effects of systemic risk factors on diabetic retinopathy. Results : The prevalence of background retinopathy was 31%, of preproliferative retinopathy 5%, and of proliferative retinopathy 5% in all patients. However, in 3 hospitals in which the patients were routinely examined by fluorescein angiography, background retinopathy was found to be present in 60%, preproliferative retinopathy in 5 %, and prolifertive retinopathy in 7%. Maculopathy was found in 8% of diabetic patients and the prevalence was 11% in the eyes with background retinopathy, 40% with preproliferative retinopathy, and 50% with proliferative retinopathy. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that retinopathy was significantly associated with duration of diabetes, methods of diabetic control, hypertension, nephropathy, and neuropathy.

METHODS: Setting: Institutional.STUDY POPULATION: The study includes 594 consecutive patients (829 eyes) with a diagnosis of NA-AION and follow-up of at least two months after the onset of NA-AION, examined in the Ocular Vascular Clinic since 1973. Simple progression of visual loss during an episode of NA-AION was not considered a fresh episode. INTERVENTION OR OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Every patient had ophthalmic evaluation, including visual acuity, visual fields with a Goldmann perimeter, intraocular pressure, and slit lamp and ophthalmoscopic evaluation at initial visit and at each follow-up visit. The patients also had systemic evaluation; some patients had echocardiography (166 patients) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring-the latter was investigated in 80 patients (17 with and 63 without recurrence of NA-AION) who consented to participate in this study which was started in 1989. While optic disk edema was present, the patients were followed every 2 to 3 weeks. Once the optic disk edema resolved, they were followed up after 3 months, 6 months, and then at yearly intervals unless they had some new visual complaint. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of a fresh episode of NA-AION in the same eye, and comparison of ocular and systemic risk factors between patients with and without recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye.RESULTS: Of the 594 patients (829 eyes) in the study, recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye occurred in 45 patients (53 eyes) with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range 2 months to 30.5 years) from the first onset of NA-AION. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed cumulative percentage of recurrence of NA-AION from first episode to second episode at three months 1.0%±0.4%(SE), at 6 months 2.7%±0.7%, at one year 4.1%±0.9%, and 2 years 5.8%±1.1%. There was no significant association between recurrence of NA-AION and the systemic conditions that were examined, except for nocturnal arterial hypotension. Overall patients with a recurrence of NA-AION had a significantly lower mean nighttime minimum diastolic BP (P = .003) and greater mean percentage drop during sleep in diastolic BP (P = .011) than those with no recurrence of NA-AION; all other measures of nocturnal hypotension were not significantly predictive.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye is uncommon (6.4%). Our study indicates that nocturnal diastolic arterial hypotension may be a risk factor; however, since this is a multifactorial disease, other so far unknown risk factors may also play a role. The role of various risk factors which may contribute to the recurrence of NA-AION is discussed.

Results: Patients with NIDDM had more often bilateral OA (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8-6.4). No association between NIDDM and generalized OA (adjusted OR = 1.0; 95%CI: 0.5-1.9) was observed.

In contrast to Husserl, I do not start with the “last” questions, but with the first question: namely, how is knowledge possible? To answer this, I define learning as a communicative practice that produces knowledge. This emphasizes the distinction between knowledge and intelligence. “Intelligence” denotes problem-solving mechanisms which can be embedded in various ways: organically in genomes; technologically in instruments; and socially in the rule systems of institutions (II–III). On this basis, the form of knowledge for the knowledge society contrasts knowledge/non-knowledge and is set against competing forms which contrast knowledge/belief or knowledge/power. The knowledge society thus stands in great need of knowledge about how to deal with ignorance or non-knowledge, particularly in order to cope with systemic risks. The use of risk models by banks serves as one example of how organizations in the knowledge society turn their dependence on knowledge and ignorance into strategies for coping with uncertainty (IV–V). Ignorance is always the corollary of knowledge. Thus, in conclusion irony and power are introduced as exemplary ways of dealing with this form of knowledge (VI–VII). © 2001, VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften/Wiesbaden.",,,"Willke, H.; Fakultät für Soziologie, Postfach 100131, Germany",,"Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden",10110070,,,,"German","Osterreichische Zeitschrift fur Soziologie",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975270862

The second part examines the efforts of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to devise non-binding international standards for managing systemic risk in financial markets. Recent financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America suggest, however, that informal efforts by international bodies such as the Basel Committee are inadequate to address the risk of systemic failure in financial systems. The third part therefore argues that efficient international financial regulation requires certain regulatory functions to be performed by a global supervisor acting in conjunction with national regulatory authorities.

The article begins by examining the critical reaction both in Australia and abroad to the doctrine which appeared to imply Australia's increased reliance on the 'special relationship' with the US and its role as a 'deputy' of its ANZUS partner in the East Asia region. The article then demonstrates the historical origins of the doctrine's thinking in Australia's reliance since the post-war period on a system of serial bilateralism and special relationships with first the UK, the US and then Indonesia. However, the article also points out the essential vulnerabilities inherent in this type of serial bilateralism and its relative inability to respond effectively to the East Timor crisis. Finally, the article considers the systemic risk in Australian policy as manifested in the doctrine, and the future viability of serial bilateralism in dealing with Australia's regional diplomatic and security agenda. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Australia; Bilateralism; East Timor; John Howard; Security; USA","diplomatic relations; foreign policy; international relations; policy analysis; Australia; East Timor","Leaver, R.; School of Political and International Studies, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, 5001, Australia; email: ptrll@sigma.sss.�inders.edu.a",,,09512748,,,,"English","Pac.

This raises the question of whether or not the provision of social insurance is moving toward some type of convergence.

The elimination of the fixed exchange rate parity with gold resulted in the privatisation of financial risk, which created pressure to eliminate controls on cross-border capital movements and the further deregulation of financial markets. It became necessary for national regulatory authorities to promote safe and sound banking systems through the effective management of systemic risk in national markets. Similarly, the need for international standards of prudential supervision was also recognised, to prevent solvent banking institutions in one jurisdiction from losing business to less respectable institutions operating in other jurisdictions whose laws permitted cut-rate financial services and other risky financial practices. The privatisation of financial risk also created the need for financial institutions to spread their risks over many assets and activities, which led, in turn, to a significant increase in short-term cross-border portfolio investment that has, in many instances, exposed capital-importing countries to increased systemic risk due to the volatility of such investments. © 2001, MCB UP Limited",,,,,,13590790,,,,"English","J.

Trends such as disintermediation and financial sector consolidation have modified the ways in which systemic shocks are propagated and distributed among market participants. This has complicated the role of banks, which continue to stand at the centre of the financial system in many countries. While the overall results will no doubt continue to be positive for households and businesses, this complexity increases the potential for uncertainty, particularly during the period when new markets and institutions are developing. These developments have also complicated the roles of financial regulators, including central banks. The response has been a move towards a greater reliance on transparency and market discipline as ways to improve the spread of information and thus prevent systemic disruption.

Variability of carotid bifurcation anatomy is a possible explanation. Flow models suggest that vessel anatomy, in particular vessel diameter and area ratios, affects plaque formation at arterial bifurcations. However, carotid bifurcation anatomy could only be a major risk factor for plaque formation if it was sufficiently variable. Since very few data exist on the extent of interindividual and intraindividual variability of bifurcation anatomy, we studied 5395 angiograms from the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Methods - To minimize changes in bifurcation anatomy secondary to atherosclerosis, we excluded vessels with ≥30% stenosis. We measured arterial diameters at disease-free points and calculated the following ratios: internal to common carotid (ICA/CCA), external to common carotid (ECA/CCA), external to internal carotid (ECA/ICA), and outflow/ inflow area. For intraindividual asymmetry, we compared the ratios on both sides. Results - Each ratio varied markedly between individuals. The 95% ranges were as follows: ICA/CCA, 0.44 to 0.86; ECA/CCA, 0.34 to 0.80; ECA/ICA, 0.55 to 1.33; and outflow/inflow area, 0.38 to 1.28. The results were very similar in 407 bifurcations with no disease. Among the 755 patients with <30% stenosis bilaterally, side differences of ≥25% were present in 17% (95% CI, 15% to 20%) for the ICA/CCA ratio, 27% (95% CI, 24% to 30%) for the ECA/CCA ratio, 32% (95% CI, 28% to 35%) for the ECA/ICA ratio, and 42% (95% CI, 38% to 45%) for the outflow/inflow area ratio. Conclusions - We found large interindividual differences in carotid bifurcation anatomy. For example, there was 4-fold variation of the ratio of outflow to inflow area.

The possibility that differences in reconstruction geometry between vein and Dacron patched sides effected restenosis outcomes was evaluated as was the value of serial common carotid wall thickness measurements in predicting restenosis. Between 1990 and 1997, 33 bilateral CEA were performed within one year on 22 men and 11 women using a greater saphenous vein patch on one side and a knitted Dacron patch on the other. Interoperative post-CEA geometry was measured. Follow-up was by duplex scans that included wall thickness measurements in the endarterectomized common carotid bulb. Over a mean follow-up of 43 months 10 (30%) Dacron patched and one (3%) vein patched CEA developed?25% restenosis (p=0.001), seven (21%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed >50% restenosis (p=0.01) and four (12%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed >70% restenosis (p =0.1 1). The Kaplan-Meier cumulative >25% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 22% and 0% at 2 years and 41% and 5% at 5 years respectively (p=0.002).

For both patients with and without recurrent stenosis the mean within patient between sides differences of the diameters of the internal carotid, internal carotid bulb, common carotid bulb, and common carotid arteries and the lengths of the internal carotid and total patch segments were not significantly different and all were less than 5%. Common carotid bulb wall thickness measured at the time of identification of the nine unilateral Dacron patched CEA restenosis was 1.5 ±0.5 mm compared to 1.4 +0.4 mm (m ± 1 SD) for the contralateral vein patched CEA (p = 0.45 by paired t test). Dacron patched CEA have a significantly higher incidence of mild, moderate and severe restenosis than do saphenous vein patched CEA independent of systemic risk factors. The within patient equality of Dacron and vein patched carotid reconstruction geometry in patients with unilateral restenosis indicates that patch material is the major local risk factor, not adverse hemodynamics produced by variance in geometry.

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively stored data. Between 1981 and 1999, 69 secondary carotid artery procedures were performed on 66 patients (3 were bilateral). Of these, 29 operations and patients came from my series of 1514 primary carotid endarterectomies (CEAs). Overall, secondary operations were performed on 37 women (1 bilateral) and 29 men (2 bilateral) with a mean age of 68 years. Indications for reoperation were transient ischemic attack in 27%, stroke in 12%, global ischemia in 9%, and asymptomatic ≥ 70% recurrent stenosis in 52%. Secondary reconstruction was by saphenous vein patching in 57% (n = 39), Dacron patching in 29% (n = 20), polytetrafluoroethylene patch in 1% (n = 1), and interposition bypass graft in 13% (n = 9). The main outcome measures included restenosis, re-restenosis, and perioperative and late stroke and death. Results: Reoperations were more frequent after originally primarily closed CEA (6.2%) than after patched CEA (1.6%, P = .01). Reoperations after Dacron-patched CEA occurred at a mean of 16 months compared with a mean of 84 months for vein-patched CEA (P < .001). Male sex and history of smoking have a slightly adverse but not statistically significant effect on the incidence and time of reoperation. Restenosis in the distal common carotid artery requiring reoperation had a near-linear rate of occurrence, whereas that in the internal carotid artery segment was bimodal with a higher incidence in the first 3 years and after 7 years. There were no (0%) 30-day perioperative deaths. There were two (2.9%) 30-day strokes (1 major, 1 minor). Over a mean follow-up of 50 months (range, 1-180), the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival was 74% at 5 years and 54% at 10 years. This is significantly higher than late death after primary CEA independent of age. The cumulative freedom from stroke rate was 90% at 5 years and 86% at 10 years. After secondary procedures re-recurrent stenosis ≥ 25% occurred in 25% (n = 17), ≥ 50% in 13% (n = 9), and ≥ 70% in 4% (n = 3). There was no statistically significant difference in stroke or re-restenosis rates between vein-patched, Dacron-patched, and bypassed reoperations, although re-recurrence tended to occur earlier after Dacron-patched than vein-patched procedures. Analysis of pooled literature data and the results of this study for stroke and re-restenosis outcomes by type secondary reconstruction (patch versus bypass graft) and by material (vein versus synthetic) give a balanced picture of near equality for each. Vein- and Dacron-patched arteries have similar outcomes, whereas polytetrafluoroethylene appears to be superior to vein and Dacron for interposition bypass graft. Conclusions: Secondary carotid artery operations are more frequent after primarily closed CEA than patched CEA. Perioperative mortality and stroke rates for reoperations are within the acceptable window of primary CEA. The incidence of late death after reoperations is higher than after primary CEA. The perioperative stroke, late stroke, and re-restenosis outcomes of vein- and Dacron-patched secondary operations are similar, as are those for patched and bypassed carotid arteries.",,"adult; aged; artery reconstruction; article; carotid artery obstruction; endarterectomy; female; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; priority journal; reoperation; risk factor; stroke; surgical mortality; surgical technique; treatment indication; treatment outcome","Archie Jr., J.P.; Carolina Cardiovasc.

Verteporfin, a photosensitising agent, is injected 15 minutes before red laser therapy in patients with neovascularisation predominantly visible in the subfoveal choroidial region. The clinical file mainly comprises two double-blind placebo-controlled trials with identical designs, in which verteporfin was injected before laser therapy. These trials show that verteporfinlaser combination therapy sometimes improves visual acuity (16% of eyes, versus 7% with laser therapy alone). It also moderately reduces the loss of vision measured at 2 years: 53% of patients have a limited loss, compared with 38% of patients treated with laser alone. The impact of this difference on daily life activities is not known. A retrospective subgroup analysis suggests that only patients with predominantly visible neovascularisation benefit from treatment with verteporfin. The main adverse effects of verteporfin are visual. Prolonged reduction in visual acuity has mainly been reported in patients with occult neovascularisation.

The variable participating insurance contract, defined as a linear combination of fully participating policy and non-participating policy, has turned out to be an optimal hedging tool. Individuals insure the idiosyncratic component of their loss exposure through a participating contract and then the systemic component is hedged through securitized products offered by financial markets. In the case of additive risk component, the optimal variable participating policy can be replicated with a fully participating insurance policy offered at a fair price and a separate hedging contract. For the case of multiplicative component, the key role of a mutual insurer has been stressed. This role could be played by cooperatives in agriculture. They could offer a variable participating policy to insured farmers, and pass off the systemic risk, which is not assumed by the policy-holders, in the capital markets.

Staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are important to identify patients with similar systemic risk who might benefit from specific treatments. This study compared four commonly used staging systems for predicting systemic outcomes of patients with localized extremity STS, as proposed by the fourth and fifth editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer (AICC/UICC) staging system, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) system, and the Surgical Staging System (SSS) of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. METHODS. Three hundred consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic STS of the lower extremity were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 1989. Metastasis free survival was the end point of the study. The prognostic value of the four staging systems and their components were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to identify the system that best predicted the risk of systemic recurrence. RESULTS. Compartment status, depth, grade, and size were all independent predictors of outcome within their respective staging systems. However, when compared with one another, only depth, grade, and size retained their prognostic significance. Of the four models, the AIC predicted that the MSK was the best predictor of systemic relapse, followed by the fifth edition of the AICC/UICC staging system. CONCLUSIONS. Staging systems such as the MSK system or the fifth edition of the AICC/UICC system, which include tumor depth, grade, and size as prognostic factors, are the most predictive of systemic relapse in patients presenting with localized extremity STS. Both of these systems identify the same group of patients at the highest risk who would be the most suitable for adjuvant chemotherapy trials.

It identifies eight stages for resolving a banking crisis and examines the responses of Korea and Mexico in each of them: (i) containing systemic risks, (ii) establishment of an overall crisis resolution unit, (iii) recognition of losses, (iv) reduction of bad assets, (v) recapitalization of banks, (vi) restructuring of corporate/household debt, (vii) strengthening of prudential regulation and supervision, and (viii) management and disposition of impaired assets. In addition, the paper compares the management of both crises in terms of transparency of decision making, speed and sequencing of reforms, and social and political obstacles faced for crisis resolution. The paper stresses four points: Firstly, there is no single approach for managing systemic banking crises. What works in one country does not necessarily work in others. Secondly, to a large extent, the resolution of a banking crisis is a managerial problem. The resolution of a crisis will depend on the ability of a government to deliver rapid and sequenced responses, remove legal and administrative obstacles, create consensus around a strategy, implement unpopular measures, coordinate involved agencies, and resist opposition from affected interest groups. Thirdly, a key factor for resolving a crisis is the realistic recognition of banks' losses at the early stages of a crisis. Unrealistic recognition of problems will likely lead to the prescription of insufficient or ineffective measures, which may provide some relief in the short-term, but fail to address the underlying causes of a crisis. Finally, an overall strategy that links all policies and programs towards the accomplishment of a coherent set of goals is crucial for the successful resolution of a banking crisis. Failure to implement policies in a coherent and sequenced basis may produce poor or even contradictory results.",,"banking; crisis management; debt; financial crisis; Korea; Mexico","De Luna-Martinez, J.; The World Bank, 1818 H.

Assesses the importance of these developments in the context of the policy options that are open to the European banking community in the new millennium. In particular, given the prospect of an integrated European economy, now commonly referred to as Euroland, the paper addresses, as its central theme, the potential for the development of pan-European banks that would then be in a position to configure longer-term globalisation strategies. Evolution in this direction, if it occurs, is important from a European Central Bank policy perspective, since it would raise systemic risk issues if a small number of European licensed banks became “too big to fail”. We conclude, however, that the most prominent strategic response is likely to be based on the European “regionalisation” of banks and markets rather than pan-Europeanisation. © 2000, MCB UP Limited","Banking; European Union; Globalization; Single market",,,,,02652323,,,,"English","Int.

OA patterns were studied in 809 patients with knee or hip joint replacement due to OA. Patients with OA were categorized as having bilateral or generalized OA according to the presence of radiographic OA in the contralateral joint or different finger joints, and as normal weight, overweight, or obese according to their body mass index (BMI). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for relative weight and OA patterns were estimated with multivariable logistic regression. Eighty-five percent of participants had bilateral OA, 26% had generalized OA, and 31% were obese. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2; OR = 8.1; 95% CI: 2.4-28) and overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2; OR = 5.9; 95% CI: 2.0-18) were strongly associated with bilateral knee OA. No association between obesity and bilateral hip OA (OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3-1.7) nor generalized OA (OR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.6-2.1) was observed. Obesity seems to be a mechanical rather than a systemic risk factor for OA with the knee joint being especially susceptible.

We find that these nonbank activities reduce the overall risk to the firm but increase systematic market risk - thus reducing the firm's ability to diversify. Moreover, the unit price of risk does not appear to contain a risk premium to price the enhanced systemic risk exposure that might be engendered by greater convergence across financial firms. Our finding suggests that if there are net gains to universal banking, potential gains from synergies and demand effects must be powerful enough to overcome the disadvantages of increased systemic risk exposure. The results suggest that diversification benefits, when considered in isolation from the other implications of expanded bank powers, are not sufficiently large to justify expanding bank powers into nonbank securities and insurance underwriting activities. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.","Bank holding company's risk; Non-bank activities; Universal banking",,"Jagtiani, J.; Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, 230 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, IL 60604-1413, United States",,"Elsevier Inc.",00129933,,JEBUD,,"English","J.

The currently available PET technology allows the measurement of regional tracer activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. Several radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced to study myocardial perfusion enabling accurate diagnosis and localization of coronary artery disease (CAD). Assessing myocardial blood flow at rest and under stress conditions and calculating (regional) coronary flow reserve by N-13 ammonia, Rb-82 or 0-15 water PET is the most sensitive means to detect any abnormal vasoreactivity which is already found at very early stages of the atherosclerotic process before any angiographic or clinical evidence of CAD. Flow tracers provide also quantitative information on the hemodynamic effects of any local, invasive (angioplasty) or systemic (risk factor modification) intervention. Metabolic imaging with F-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) PET represents currently the gold-standard for tissue viability assessment with well-validated information about the presence and extent of viable myocardium. The prognostic information of metabolic imaging extends to (preoperative) risk stratification in patients with congestive heart failure and facilitates the decision making between revascularization or conservative management. FDG has been also used in combination with SPECT providing comparable physiologic and pathophysiologic information but without need for the expensive and rarely available imaging technology of PET. More recently, newer tracers such as radiolabeled catecholamine analogs allowed the evaluation of cardiac autonomic innervation in a variety of cardiac diseases with involvement of neuronal innervation. C-11 hydroxyephedrine (HED) enabled imaging of alterations in neuronal innervation in diabetes, congestive heart failure and after heart transplantation. The unique functional and prognostic potential provided by PET imaging together with an expected easier access to this technology with better availability of lower cost instrumentation should raise its clinical acceptance in the near future.",,"diagnostic agent; glucose; radiopharmaceutical agent; adrenergic system; biological phenomena and functions concerning organ systems; computer assisted emission tomography; coronary artery blood flow; heart; heart disease; heart muscle; human; innervation; metabolism; methodology; pathophysiology; review; scintiscanning; Coronary Circulation; Glucose; Heart; Heart Diseases; Humans; Myocardium; Radiopharmaceuticals; Sympathetic Nervous System; Tissue Survival; Tomography, Emission-Computed","Pirich, C.",,,08702551,,,"10750444","English","Rev Port Cardiol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034137546

It is generally accepted that there is very few reliable quantitative and qualitative data on dermal exposure to chemicals in the general population and in occupationally exposed workers. In order to predict the systemic risk of dermally absorbed chemicals and to enable agencies to set safety standards, data is needed on the rates of percutaneous penetration of important chemicals. Standardization of in vitro tests and comparison of their results with the in vivo data could produce internationally accepted penetration rates and/or absorption percentages very useful for regulatory toxicology. The work of the Percutaneous Penetration Subgroup of EC Dermal Exposure Network has been focussed on the standardization and validation of in vitro experiments, necessary to obtain internationally accepted penetration rates for regulatory purposes. The members of the Subgroup analyzed the guidelines on percutaneous penetration in vitro studies presented by various organizations and suggested a standardization of in vitro models for percutaneous penetration taking into account their individual experiences, literature data and guidelines already in existence. During the meetings of Percutaneous Penetration Subgroup they presented a number of short papers of up to date information on the key issues. The objective was to focus the existing knowledge and the gaps in the knowledge in the field of percutaneous penetration. This paper is an outcome of the meetings of the Percutaneous Penetration Subgroup and reports the presentations on the key issues identified throughout the 3-year duration of the Dermal Exposure Network (1997-1999).

The East Asian economies are rebounding from last year's collapse in output. Improved prospects and an easing of monetary conditions in many parts of the developing world have boosted emerging equity markets and reduced interest rates from the sky-high levels of mid-1998. Developing countries also are benefiting from the acceleration of growth and interest rate reductions in industrial countries. However, the recovery is both uneven and fragile, and many countries continue to struggle in the aftermath of the crisis. Several countries in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe face declines in output in 1999, and outside of Asia developing countries' per capita income is expected to fall. Continued imbalances in industrial countries markedly increase the risks presented by the international economic environment. Furthermore, the cyclical recovery in East Asia has not addressed severe difficulties that were either caused or exacerbated by the crisis. In addition to a review of international economic developments and prospects, Global Economic Prospects 2000 considers three areas where the crisis has had a major impact on growth and welfare in the developing world. First, the crisis has increased poverty in the East Asian crisis countries, Brazil, and the Russian Federation, and elsewhere. Chapter 2 reviews the evidence on the crisis' social impact on East Asia and other developing countries and addresses the broader issue of the impact of external shocks on poverty in developing countries. Second, though the East Asian crisis countries are experiencing a strong cyclical recovery, severe structural problems remain, notably the banking systems' high levels of nonperforming loans and the large share of insolvent firms. Chapter 3 outlines the depth of the problems faced by the corporate and financial sectors of these economies, analyzes the challenges facing the restructuring and reducing systemic risk. Third, exchange rate depreciations and declines in demand in East Asia exacerbated the fall in primary commodity prices that began in 1996. Countries that depend on primary commodities have faced an enormous challenge in smoothing consumption in the face of booms and busts in commodity prices and adjusting to the secular decline in commodity prices relative to manufactures. Chapter 4 examines how the most commodity- dependent economies in the world - the major oil exporting countries and the non-oil exporters of Sub-Saharan Africa - have adjusted to the commodity price cycle.",,"economic conditions; economic development; financial crisis; future prospect; poverty alleviation",,,"World Bank Publications Department",,0821345508,,,"English",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034087934

Monitoring included systemic/local risk factors, bacteriology, antibiotic prophylaxis and surgical treatment. Statistical evaluation was based on stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results: For 1813 patients (2362 operations) the overall infection rate was 4.9%. Two significant local risks (i.e. localisation; extent of associated soft tissue damage) were identified. No significant influence of systemic risk factors or of the pre-existing morbidity was observed. In high risk patients or interventions, adapted procedures were performed.

We examined the responses of eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels to dynamic shear stimuli in the presence of pathological risk modifiers. METHODS: Confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells were subjected in vitro to shear stress (using a cone-plate viscometer) and to hydrostatic pressure (using a custom-built pressure chamber device). eNOS mRNA levels were quantitated by densitometric analysis of Northern blots. RESULTS: In contrast to steady laminar shear stress, which elevated eNOS mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner (2.9- and 3.6-fold after 6 h at 4 and 20 dyn/cm2, respectively), steady hydrostatic pressure of 150 mm Hg decreased eNOS mRNA levels by 46%. eNOS mRNA up-regulation by shear stress was reversible after cessation of flow, although it was not influenced by previous shear exposure, and it was not mediated by a stable transferable factor. eNOS mRNA up-regulation by sinusoidal shear stress was frequency- dependent, with a moderate response at 1-Hz oscillating shear and no change at 0.3 Hz. Hypoxia (3% O2) suppressed eNOS mRNA expression by 78% under static conditions and by 72% under shear conditions but did not alter the fold induction by shear. Elevated glucose concentrations reduced eNOS mRNA levels in both resting and shear stress-exposed cells but did not reduce the fold induction by shear; the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C was without effect. Shear-induced up-regulation of eNOS mRNA was unaffected by changes in the medium partial pressure of CO2/pH, by the Na+/H+-exchanger inhibitor HOE694, or by aspirin. In contrast, the shear response was potentiated by homocysteine. CONCLUSION: Both physical and chemical stimuli regulate eNOS mRNA levels in endothelial cells. Although eNOS mRNA expression is increased by shear stress, it is decreased by hydrostatic pressure, hypoxia, and elevated glucose levels. The effect of shear on eNOS mRNA expression involves a reversible, frequency-dependent process. These in vitro findings suggest possible contributions of the eNOS flow response to atherosclerosis, in the presence of systemic risk factors.","Atherosclerosis; Flow; Fluid mechanics; Hyperglycemia; Hypoxia; Mechanical stress; Protein kinase","glucose; messenger RNA; nitric oxide synthase; animal cell; article; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; endothelium cell; enzyme regulation; hydrostatic pressure; hypoxia; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; risk factor; RNA analysis; shear stress; Animals; Cattle; Cell Hypoxia; Cells, Cultured; Endothelium, Vascular; Glucose; Homocysteine; Hydrostatic Pressure; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Osmolar Concentration; RNA, Messenger; Stress, Mechanical","Malek, A.M.; UCSF Medical Center, 505 Parnassus Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94143, United States",,,0148396X,,NRSRD,"10449079","English","Neurosurgery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032818222

With a regional crop failure, farmers may lose a portion of their profits from lower sales as well as a portion of their patronage refunds, since the co-op may also experience economic losses due to decreased throughput. This issue, which is most significant for value-added processing cooperatives, has largely been ignored, in part because solutions to the problem have previously not been feasible. Ironically, a primary incentive for farmers to invest in and supply to a cooperative is the co-op's ability to mitigate some of the farmers' risk (Sporleder and Goldsmith). The cooperative helps mitigate farm price risk by selling either raw farm products-into markets where and when prices are less variable-or processed products characterized by market prices more stable than commodity prices. However, farm members often fail to recognize the substantial risks to which their cooperative, and thus their invested equity, may be exposed. This has become more of a salient issue with the creation of new-generation cooperatives (NGCs), closed-membership cooperatives that typically require a substantial initial equity investment from farmer members. The motivation for cooperatives to mitigate risk and the feasibility of new, alternative risk-sharing instruments for the cooperative model are the main points of discussion in this article. Utilizing the new instruments, cooperatives can enhance the risk mitigation role they play for their farmer members in two ways: (a) The co-op can mitigate its own risk directly with capital market innovations that shift or share its systemic risk exposure, and (b) the co-op can offer insurance directly to its members to cover each member's independent risk. The feasibility of these two alternatives will depend on whether the risk-mitigation effects are valuable to farmer members and the costs and ease of implementation (transaction costs).",,"agricultural cooperative; cooperative sector; risk factor; strategic approach",,,"American Agricultural Economics Association",00029092,,,,"English","Am.

The pace of such reform accelerated markedly in recent years to help stabilize the Japanese financial system in the face of systemic risk, be it due to the failure of the housing loan companies (the jusen) or other major institutions, such as Yamaichi Securities and the city bank Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. The evolution of local deposit insurance arrangements to cope with such events is explained here and an assessment of the policy responses is provided. The part played by deposit insurance in alleviating the pressures currently experienced by the Japanese banking sector also is addressed.

While the gold standard is now history, currency boards have become fashionable lately. In essence, a currency board arrangement (CBA) issues narrow money, typically cash (notes and coins), with 100% foreign exchange reserves. It can theoretically fix the exchange rate of even the broad money through two automatic stabilizing mechanisms: specie-flow and cash arbitrage. Both appeal to the 'selfish' behaviour of market participants, without invoking the need for direct government interference. In a modern financial economy with large cross-border flow of funds and a diminishing cash base, both the presumed automatic stabilizers for the classical CBA are thrown into serious doubt. Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system (the link) is used as the key example to illustrate the 'efficiency risk' of a CBA failing to firmly anchor the spot exchange rate, in the light of the recent speculative currency attacks in East Asia. There are alternatives to strengthen a CBA by reducing its efficiency risk, e.g. the convertible reserves mechanism of Argentina, Estonia and Lithuania (the AEL model), which surpasses the arbitrage efficiency of the classical currency board and the old gold standard. Unfortunately, it has not been given the attention that it deserves in the literature. There are also proposals involving insurance options issued by the monetary authority that guarantee the fixed exchange rate. The latter actually also aim at eliminating the 'systemic risk' of the CBA by committing the monetary authority to an 'irrevocable' contract to defend the fixed exchange rate. These alternatives impose additional burdens on the CBA, as well as increasing the 'exit cost' from the CBA if it is deemed desirable to abandon the peg. This paper assesses the CBA as a genre in its historical context and the various alternatives to strengthen it. Hong Kong serves as the central illustration and is contrasted with the AEL model, while Indonesia is used as an example to illustrate some of the pre-conditions for a CBA to be an effective crisis solution. A key conclusion is that a balance has to be struck between the short-term security of a CBA on the one hand, and the long-term consideration of preserving flexibility for the choice of the optimal exchange rate regime in a possible scenario of external crisis, on the other.",,"exchange rate; financial market; risk assessment",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13513958,,,,"English","Asian Econ.

Financial consolidation also opens up opportunities to dramatically reduce the scope of deposit insurance and limit it to narrow bank accounts, thus substantially reducing the moral hazard created by the government safety net. Reducing the scope of deposit insurance, however, does not eliminate the need for a government safety net, and thus there is still a strong need for adequate prudential supervision of the financial system. Moving to a world in which we have larger, nationwide, diversified financial institutions and in which deposit insurance plays a very limited role, should improve the efficiency of the financial system. However, it is no panacea: the job of financial regulators and supervisors will continue to be highly challenging in the future. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We measured urinary cotinine levels in the infants as a measure of environmental tobacco smoke exposure and cotinine levels in the breast milk of breast- feeding mothers. Results: Of 507 infants, urinary cotinine levels during the first 2 weeks of life were significantly increased in infants whose mothers smoked. Breast-fed infants had higher cotinine levels than non-breast-fed infants, but this was statistically significant (P<.05) only if mothers smoked. Urinary cotinine levels were 5 times higher in breast-fed infants whose mothers smoked than in those whose mothers smoked but did not breast- feed.

Previously the authors reported a significant correlation between a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the discovery of an unruptured aneurysm in a group of healthy volunteers. This study corroborates and extends previous findings regarding the relationship between genetic and acquired factors in the formation of cerebral aneurysms. Methods. The incidence of asymptomatic, unruptured cerebral aneurysms was studied among patients with a family history of SAH within the second degree of consanguinity. Forty-one unruptured cerebral aneurysms were found in 34 (13.9%) of 244 patients. This incidence was significantly higher than that found in a control group of healthy volunteers (6%). Furthermore, patients who had a family history of SAH combined with multiple systemic risk factors were found to have the highest incidence of unruptured aneurysms (32%; odds ratio 3.49, 95% confidence interval 1.37-8.9). Conclusions. These findings suggest that patients with a family history of SAH with or without the presence of more than one systemic risk factor are at significantly higher risk of harboring cerebral aneurysms. This high-risk group should be periodically screened and treated with appropriate surgical or other forms of therapy when necessary.","Cerebral aneurysm; Familial aneurysm; Hereditary; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Systemic risk factor","adult; aged; aneurysm rupture; article; brain artery aneurysm; consanguinity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; environmental factor; family history; female; genetic predisposition; high risk population; human; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; mass screening; priority journal; risk factor; smoking habit; subarachnoid hemorrhage","Nakagawa, T.; ShinSapporo Neurosurgical Hospital, 1-jo 2-chome, Atsubetsu-ku, Sapporo 004-0031, Japan; email: snh@po.sphere.ne.jp",,"American Association of Neurological Surgeons",00223085,,JONSA,"10470812","English","J.

Design: Geographically defined population-based cohort study. Setting: An 11-county area in Wisconsin. Study Population: Participants were all younger-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed as having diabetes at <30 years of age and taking insulin) and a random sample of older-onset diabetic persons (diagnosed as having diabetes at ≥30 years of age). Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, visual acuity, and cataract were measured using standardized protocols at baseline examinations from 1980 to 1982, in which 996 younger-onset and 1370 older-onset persons participated. Participants were followed up for 16 years. Main Outcome Measure: All-cause and cause-specific mortality as determined from death certificates. Results: In the younger-onset group, after controlling for age and sex, retinopathy severity, macular edema, cataract, history of cataract surgery, and history of glaucoma at baseline were associated with all-cause and ischemic heart disease mortality. In the older- onset group, after controlling for age and sex, retinopathy and visual impairment were related to all-cause, ischemic heart disease, and stroke mortality. No ocular variable under study was related to cancer mortality in the older-onset group. After controlling for systemic risk factors, visual impairment was associated with all-cause and ischemic heart disease mortality in the younger-onset group. In the older-onset group, retinopathy severity was related to all-cause and stroke mortality, and visual impairment was related to all-cause, ischemic heart disease, and stroke mortality. Conclusions: Presence of more severe retinopathy or visual impairment in diabetic patients is a risk indicator for increased risk of ischemic heart disease death.

It is now widely accepted that these crises resulted from both domestic policy failures-exacerbated in some cases by adverse external and political shocks-and weaknesses in the international financial system. In line with this analysis, two kinds of reform proposals can be distinguished. The first includes improvements in domestic policies and increased transparency. This would both reduce the fundamental weaknesses that make countries vulnerable to financial crises and make it less likely that existing weaknesses could build up unnoticed for substantial periods. The second includes measures to address systemic risks and contain crises more directly, such as improving international institutions, rules for debt workouts, and the regulation of certain types of international capital flows.",,"capital flow; market transition; transitional economy",,,,01451707,,,,"English","Financ.

The optimal area yield crop insurance contract depends on the individual beta coefficient which measures the sensitivity of farm yield to area yield. Indemnity payments are made whenever the realized area yield is lower (higher) than a critical yield if the beta coefficient is positive (negative). The optimal contract contains a ""disappearing deductible"" if the beta coefficient is higher than unity.","Crop insurance; Efficient risk-sharing; Systemic risk",,"Mahul, O.; Inst. Natl. de la Rech.
