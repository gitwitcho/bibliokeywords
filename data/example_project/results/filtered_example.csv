"Lei, A.; Zhao, H.; Tian, Y.",The intersectoral systemic risk shock of emergency crisis events in china's financial market: nonparametric methods and panel event study analyses,"By employing two systemic risk methods, the marginal expected shortfall (MES) and the component expected shortfall (CES), this paper measures the systemic risk level of all sectors in China’s financial market from 2014 to 2022 thereby, it researches the total effect of sectoral systemic risk using a panel event study model during the three main emergency crisis events. Moreover, two nonparametric methods are utilized, the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and the bootstrap Kolmogorov Smirnov test, in order to investigate the changes in individual effects and the dominant ranks of sectoral systemic risk. The empirical show that (1) the mean values and volatilities of CES and MES of all sectors have a higher level of magnitude in the extreme risk status than those in the normal risk status (2) by comparing the total effects of three crisis events, we find that different from the continuous shock effect caused by two other events, sectoral systemic risk has a hysteresis effect on the entire market after the outbreak of COVID-19 (3) the long-term and short-term individual effects of sectoral systemic risk in all sectors are different from each other during three events and (4) the dominance tests of MES are more sensitive and thus better demonstrate the changes in the rankings of sectoral systemic risk than the dominant tests of CES during the emergency crisis events.",2023,2023-03-12,0,Systems,,Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Econometrics; Shock (circulatory); Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Economics; Panel data; Medicine; Macroeconomics; Economic growth; Internal medicine; Curriculum,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11030147,,biblio,,195-467-484-694-767,

We find that mergers during the crisis decreased market-adjusted systemic risk. This effect was more pronounced for mergers with smaller acquirers of larger targets. Meanwhile, mergers of larger banks increased the aggregate systemic risk. In the years following the crisis, we find that banks that merged during the crisis had lower return volatility and fewer nonperforming loans than non-merged banks.

"Kuang, Y.; Douady, R.",Crisis risk prediction with concavity from polymodel,"Financial crises are an important research topic because of their impact on the economy, businesses, and populations. However, prior research tends to generate reactive systemic risk measures, in the sense that the measure surges after the crisis starts. Few of them succeed in warning of financial crises in advance. In this paper, we first sketch a toy model that produces normal mixture distributions based on a dynamic regime switching model. We derive that the relative concavity among various indices tends to increase before a crisis. Using Polymodel theory, we introduce a measure of concavity as a crisis risk indicator, and test it against known crises observed in the past. We validate this indicator by a trading strategy holding long or short positions on theP 500 Index, depending on the indicator value. 2022",2022,2022-01-01,1,Journal of Dynamics and Games,economics; finance; financial crisis; investment strategy; nonlinearity; normal mixtures; polymodel; research topics; risk assessment; risk measures; risk predictions; systemic risk; systemic risks; toy models,,,"Kuang, Y.

Understanding the relation between the structure of connections between the system's constituents and the emergence of a crisis is of great importance. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the inference of economic systems' structures based on complex networks theory utilizing the time series of prices. Our network is obtained from the correlation matrix between the time series of companies' prices by imposing a threshold on the values of the correlation coefficients. The optimal value of the threshold is determined by comparing the spectral properties of the threshold network and the correlation matrix. We analyze the community structure of the obtained networks and the relation between communities' inter and intra-connectivity as indicators of systemic risk. Our show how an economic system's behavior is related to its structure and how the crisis is reflected in changes in the structure. We show how regulation and deregulation affect the structure of the system.

"Zhu, B.; Lin, R.; Deng, Y.; Chen, P.; Chevallier, J.",Intersectoral systemic risk spillovers between energy and agriculture under the financial and COVID-19 crises,"Considering the severity and frequency of industry-specific shocks, this paper examines how sector-induced contagion effects caused by significant crises (e.g., the global financial crisis and COVID-19) propagate between energy and agricultural sectors worldwide. Relevant literature fails to concern the influence of these cross-sectoral transmission mechanisms on the energy-agriculture nexus and its relevance. By modifying the copula-extreme value theory-marginal expected shortfall (Copula-EVT-MES) method and using daily commodity returns from 2005M3 2020M5, our study captures significant intersectoral systemic risk spillovers, with asymmetrical and persistent patterns in energy-agricultural pairs. Furthermore, the bioethanol production (physical channel) and the financialization of commodities (financial channel) mainly relate to the shock spillovers. Compared to the financial crisis, the systemic risk spillovers in the COVID-19 crisis rely more on the physical channel, which emphasizes the importance of bioenergy-related shocks. The macro-conditions and supply-demand shocks are also important determinants for such spillovers during the ongoing crisis. 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2021-01-01,12,Economic Modelling,agricultural sector; bioenergy; covid-19; fossil energy; intersectoral systemic risk spillover,,,"Zhu, B.

This poor performance may bring serious consequences for the system stability, possibly causing very adverse effects on the banking and insurance industries. In this paper we propose a new systemic risk measure based on extreme value theory, the Financial System Dependence Index (FSDI) which uses the spread of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) of financial institutions as the data source. Furthermore we add time dynamics for this measure, which is described by a GAS model. We motivate the quality of FSDI by comparing it to the risk measure proposed by Segoviano and Goodhart (2009), the Bank Stability Index (BSI), through a horse race based on the ideas of Rodr guez-Moreno and Pe a (2013).

"Hellwig, M.",Twelve years after the financial crisis too-big-to-fail is still with us,"This article comments on the Consultation Report published by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) evaluating the success of regulatory reforms since the global financial crisis of 2007 2009. It argues that the FSB’s assessment of the role of equity is too narrow, being phrased in terms of bankruptcy avoidance and risk-taking incentives, without attention to debt overhang creating distortions in funding choices, the systemic impact of ample equity reducing deleveraging needs after losses, or equity contributing to smoothing of lending and asset purchases over time. The FSB’s treatment of systemic risk also pays too little attention to the mutual interdependence of different parts of the system, which is not well captured by linear causal relationships. Finally, the article points out that bank resolution of systemically important institutions is still not viable, due to lack of political acceptance of single-point-of-entry procedures and bail-in. Within the European Union, this viability is further undermined by the lack of sufficient funding for banks in resolution and the lack of fiscal backstops.",2021,2021-01-27,1,Journal of Financial Regulation,,Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Financial system,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jfr/fjaa012,https://academic.oup.com/jfr/article/7/1/175/6121251 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3292133,biblio,,065-008-327-177-233,

"Wei, S.",Conceptualizing the regulatory thicketchina's financial markets after the global financial crisis,"This book examines the regulatory framework, regulatory s, regulatory logics, regulatory instruments, regulatory failures, and regulatory responses in China’s financial market after the global financial crisis. The book provides an in-depth analysis of China’s contemporary financial regulatory system, focusing on risks, regulation, and policies in practice. By drawing on public and private interest theories relating to financial regulation, the book contends that the controlled development of the banking sector, and the financial sector generally, has transformed China’s banks into more market-oriented institutions and increased public sector growth. However, China’s financial market and financial regulation have some inherent weaknesses and deficiencies. This book also offers insights into how this can be improved or adapted to minimize systemic risks in China’s financial sector. This book tries to prove that financial regulation is not just a vehicle for maintaining efficient financial markets but a primary tool through which the Chinese government achieves its political and economic s. More fundamentally, according to the law and finance theory, strong market and vibrant judicial systems are needed to further modernize China’s financial markets and market economy.

"Goodell, G.; Al-Nakib, H.D.; Tasca, P.",Digital currency and economic crises: helping states respond,"The current crisis, at the time of writing, has had a profound impact on the financial world, introducing the need for creative approaches to revitalising the economy at the micro level as well as the macro level. In this informal analysis and design proposal, we describe how infrastructure for digital assets can serve as a useful monetary and fiscal policy tool and an enabler of existing tools in the future, particularly during crises, while aligning the trajectory of financial technology innovation toward a brighter future. We propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both internet purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. We also propose an approach to digital currency that would allow for more efficient and transparent clearing and settlement, implementation of monetary and fiscal policy, and management of systemic risk. The digital currency could be implemented as central bank digital currency (CBDC), or it could be issued by the government and collateralised by public funds or Treasury assets. Our proposed architecture allows both manifestations and would be operated by banks and other money services businesses, operating within a framework overseen by government regulators. We argue that now is the time for action to undertake development of such a system, not only because of the current crisis but also in anticipation of future crises resulting from geopolitical risks, the continued globalisation of the digital economy, and the changing value and risks that technology brings.",2020,2020-06-04,0,Arxiv (cornell University),,Digital currency; Treasury; Currency; Business; Monetary policy; Globalization; Economics; Financial system; Finance; Monetary economics; Market economy; Archaeology; History,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2006.03023,,biblio,,050-530-472-327-83X,
"Al-Yahyaee, K.H.; Mensi, W.; Rehman, M.U.; Vo, X.V.; Kang, S.H.",Do islamic stocks outperform conventional stock sectors during normal and crisis periods extreme co-movements and portfolio management analysis,"This study (i) compares the performance of 22 Islamic and conventional Dow Jones stock market indices during the recent pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, namely, the global financial crisis (GFC) and the European sovereign debt crisis (ESDC) (ii) analyzes the time-frequency co-movements between conventional and Islamic stock sectors and (iii) evaluates portfolio risk management. We apply different performance measures, namely, the Sharpe, Roy, Treynor, Omega, and Alpha Jensen. These are based on the capital asset pricing model-exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (CAPM-EGARCH) model, and the cross wavelet transform approach, the wavelet approach, and the conditional value at risk (CVaR). using the Alpha Jensen performance measure show that Islamic equity returns dominate conventional equity returns during the full sample period. However, the pre-crisis periods are dominated by higher conventional equity returns, irrespective of the return measures employed. During the GFC, the ESDC, and the post-crisis periods, Islamic equity returns dominate their conventional counterparts. Moreover, the co-movements of sectors vary over time and across frequencies and depend on major events. We find that portfolios consisting of Islamic and conventional equity markets within the industrial and utilities sectors offer maximum risk reductions in terms of portfolio value at risk (VaR). Whereas, portfolios consisting of Islamic and conventional stock markets of aggregate equities, basic materials, consumer services, and technologies highlight traces of low-diversification benefits across the entire sampling period. The consumer goods, energy, financial, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors highlight the least diversification benefits in terms of differences in portfolio VaR.

"Kabundi, A.N.; De, S.F.N.",Growth and inflation implications of systemic risk in the euro area banking industry: lessons from the financial crisis,"This study has two s. It first assesses the output and inflation effects of systemic risk-taking in the euro area banking sector using a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model that exploits a 519 time-series rich dataset, including coherent measures of systemic risk in all its forms and its time dimension. Then, it evaluates whether the systemic risk measures can be used as early warning signals of severe negative nominal growth outcomes using the Receiver Operating Characteristic approach. The main findings are that, overall, real GDP growth and inflation react negatively to a one-standard deviation shock to systemic risk measures of the euro area banking industry. Inflation depicts a more pronounced response than GDP. There is heterogeneity in the strength of the responses across diverse forms of systemic risk and their time dimension. Specifically, short-term systemic risk measures tend to portray stronger effects on output and inflation than their conditional forward counterparts. In particular, systemic risk in the form of banking sector vulnerability associated with interconnectedness and contagion plays a considerable role in depressing economic activity in the euro area. Finally, all but one systemic risk measure predict with high accuracy the extreme macro-financial instability in the euro area that followed Lehman Brothers’ collapse. The systemic risk measures are potentially good candidates to be included in a macroprudential-policy toolkit for calibrating instruments at thresholds that reflect policymakers’ risk preferences.",2020,2020-01-01,2,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Kabundi, A.N.

These countries share similar macroeconomic environments (unemployment, inflation and economic growth rates). All the data relating to the banks are manually drawn from the supervising reports submitted to banks and are available on the banks’ websites and or on that of the AMF website. The banks included in our sample are drawn from the list of European central banks on www.ecb.int,The empirical show that banks undertake tradeoffs between different governance mechanisms to alleviate the intensity of the agency conflicts between the shareholders and managers. The findings also confirm that internal mechanisms and capital regulations are complementary and significantly impact bank performance.,This analysis can be extended through studying the interaction between bondholders’ governance and shareholders’ governance and their impact on the 2008 financial crisis.,The changes in banking governance help banks find a useful and necessary way to avoid ill-considered risks that can cause a systemic risk. Therefore, some conditions should be met so that banking governance can contribute to the economic development.,Culture and mentality of good banking governance must grow as much as possible through awareness-raising, training, promotion, recognition of performance, enhancing procedure transparency and stability of good banking governance and regulations, strengthening the national capacity to fight against corruption, and preventive mechanisms.,This paper complements previous studies, mainly those of Andres and Vallelado (2008) who examine the impact of the components of the board on banking performance and of Laeven and Levine (2009) who estimate the combined effect of regulatory and ownership structure on the risk-taking of each bank.",2019,2019-03-04,8,Managerial Auditing Journal,,Shareholder; Business; Systemic risk; Unemployment; Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Risk taking; External governance; Corporate governance; Financial system,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/maj-11-2017-1704,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MAJ-11-2017-1704/full/html https://ideas.repec.org/a/eme/majpps/maj-11-2017-1704.html,biblio,,001-845-589-432-974,

The Eurostat database contains data on House price indices (HPI) at national level for all EU member states. The data starts in 2005 for some countries, and later for the others. From 2010 onwards, the available data allows a comparison encompassing all EU Member states plus Norway and Island.The advantage of the Eurostat data is that it is official data, compiled based on transaction prices and following a harmonised methodology across countries. The of this presentation is to show how this database can provide reliable answers to the following questions:How deep was the dip in the EU countries When did the various countries pass with HPI pre-crisis levels Who were the best performers in the last decade The Eurostat database also contains data on the evolution of prices for new and existing dwellings. This presentation will reveal how the Eurostat database can be used to shed light on the analysis of the different patterns of the HPI for new and existing dwellings during the crisis and the following recovery. We show that by taking into account the dynamics of construction activity and sales of new dwellings during and after the crisis, the Eurostat data can be effectively used in the analysis of the evolution of housing markets in the EU in the last decade. A special focus will be on the countries having received a warning from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) at end 2016 having identified these residential real estate markets as a risk for financial stability.Furthermore, we show how this data can be combined with data on rent prices evolution available also in the Eurostat database from the section dedicated to the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices. One relevant question is: did rent developments between 2008 and 2018 show similar patterns to house prices or were the rents developments much softer Knowing what the data represents helps for a correct interpretation of the official figures.In summary, these datasets being official statistics published by Eurostat support to analyse both longer-term developments like recoveries after the crisis or latest developments indicating towards overheated residential real estate markets.",2019,2019-01-01,0,,,Financial economics; Economic rent; Business; Systemic risk; Official statistics; Financial crisis; Index (economics); Residential real estate; House price; Database transaction,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arz/wpaper/eres2019_276.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arz/wpaper/eres2019_276.html https://eres.architexturez.net/doc/oai-eres-id-eres2019-276,biblio,,118-415-080-231-11X,
"Engle, R.F.; Ruan, T.",Measuring the probability of a financial crisis,"When financial firms are undercapitalized, they are vulnerable to external shocks. The natural response to such vulnerability is to reduce leverage, and this can endogenously start a financial crisis. Excessive credit growth, the main cause of financial crises, is reflected in the undercapitalization of the financial sector. Market-based measures of systemic risk such as SRISK, which stands for systemic risk, enable monitoring how such weakness emerges and progresses in real time. In this paper, we develop quantitative estimates of the level of systemic risk in the financial sector that precipitates a financial crisis. Common approaches to reduce leverage correspond to specific scaling of systemic risk measures. In an econometric framework that recognizes financial crises represent left tail events for the economy, we estimate the relationship between SRISK and the financial crisis severity for 23 developed countries. We develop a probability of crisis measure and an SRISK capacity measure based on our estimates.

"Elyasiani, E.; Jia, J.J.",Relative performance and systemic risk contributions of small and large banks during the financial crisis,"During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, large banks (BHCs with assets exceeding $1 billion) suffered a sharper decline in performance and a greater increase in systemic risk, than small banks (BHCs with assets less than $1 billion). Performance is measured by return on assets (ROA) and EBIT TA. Systemic risk (SRISK) is measured by the capital shortfall indicator proposed by Brownless and Engle (2017) and total risk is standard deviation of monthly returns. We test four hypotheses associated with the dissimilarity in behavioral patterns of large and small banks during the crisis: (1) the nontraditional banking activity hypothesis, (2) the organizational structure hypothesis, (3) the accounting risk hypotheses, and (4) the accounting conservatism hypothesis. We find that behavioral dissimilarities between large and small banks can be, at least, partially related to the first three hypotheses. Non-nested test procedures show that factors associated with nontraditional activity hypothesis fit the data for performance (ROA and EBIT TA) and total risk the best. Organizational complexity factors are the most relevant set of variables related to systemic risk of banks (SRISK). The implications of our findings are that regulators should focus on factors related these two hypotheses to optimally alter bank performance and bank contribution to systemic risk, rather than limiting bank size and bank acquisitions as proposed by Section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Act (effective January 1, 2015). Our recommendation is in accord with attempts by the Trump administration to relax the Dodd-Frank Act. 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",2019,2019-01-01,7,Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,financial crisis; financial intermediation; large and small banks; performance; systemic risk,,,"Elyasiani, E.

"Anagnostopoulos, Y.; Kabeega, J.",Insider perspectives on european banking challenges in the post-crisis regulation environment,"The purpose of this paper is to make a highly topical and practical contribution by investigating the interplay between capital and liquidity risk management and managerial decision making in banking, following the Basel III for enhancing the safeguards against systemic risk. Specifically, we attempt to gauge the experience and assess the degree of tensions among banking practitioners’ perspectives on the reformed banking liquidity practice and risk-capital management in light of the newly introduced increased capital and liquidity requirements, which are to become fully and unilaterally effective as of 2019. As currently seen the liquidity provision requirement has become a distinct form of sharing’ financial risks in the global economy, which includes the supply of capital from its issuers. This article reviews the issue from a European perspective attempting to gain insight into: (1) the suggestion that the new regulations lack internal consistency owed to their complexity, which creates the potential for both inter- and intra-company regulatory capital arbitrage and credit constriction and (2) the suggestion that increased capital and liquidity requirements may have a significant impact on bank behaviour and or certain business model segments. Both of the above can potentially distort managerial behaviour through altering managerial incentives and hence fail to adequately regulate bank behaviour. With regard to the liquidity requirements, whilst we do not attempt to quantifiably assess the degree to which liquidity regulations (the liquidity coverage ratio in particular LCR henceforth) affect returns on equity assets to banks, our interviews are used as a triangulating measure for complementing quantitative studies that can provide a further insight into the perception of affecting managerial incentives. We aim to add to, update, and enrich the studies around the vital research question of whether the new regulation and liquidity standards can achieve their ultimate of upholding financial soundness and stability. Therefore, this research is important to complete the extant literature on updated insiders’ perspectives that investigate the effectiveness of the new regulatory framework imminently to be fully applicable by 2019.

The data covers the net written premiums by line of business and trading for UK general insurance firms over a decade period (2007-2016). Additionally, the data comprises areas that are peculiar to evaluate general insurance business such as net written premiums, underwritingclaims incurred, investment income and trading which makes it important to investigate the probability of default of different business lines and insolvency risk. The data presented could serve as useful tool to supervise local insurance firms and take earlier action in the case of risky firms before they breach solvency capital requirements. The data are useful to evaluate growth performance of UK non-life insurance industry which can be compare with other countries. Likewise, the data analysis can allow for measurement of insurance firms competitiveness and detect systemic risk which may disrupt the financial industry. The uniqueness of this data is its focus on insurance business as risky which is an area where Solvency II concentrates on as a risk-based approach to prevent the failure of insurance firms. The failure of insurance companies may disrupt the financial industry, increase systemic risk and affect negatively the real economy.

"Pellegrini, C.B.; Meoli, M.; Pellegrini, L.A.; Urga, G.","Systemic risk determinants in the european banking industry during financial crises, 2006-2012","The recent financial turmoil has stimulated a rich debate in banking and financial literature on the identification of systemic risk determinants and devices to forecast and prevent crises. This paper explores the contribution of corporate variables to systemic risk using the CoVaR approach (Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2016). Using balanced panel data on 141 European banks from 24 countries, which were listed from 2006Q1 to 2012Q4, we investigated the impact of corporate variables during the three regimes that characterised the European banking sector-the subprime crisis (2007Q3-2008Q3), the European Great Financial Depression (2008Q4-2010Q2), and the sovereign debt crisis (2010Q3-2012Q4). Our show that size did not play a significant role in spreading systemic risk, while maturity mismatch did.

"Mezei, J.; Sarlin, P.",Possibilistic clustering for crisis prediction: systemic risk states and membership degrees,"Research on understanding and predicting systemic financial risk has been of increasing importance in the recent years. A common approach is to build predictive models based on macro-financial vulnerability indicators to identify systemic risk at an early stage. In this article, we outline an approach for identifying different systemic risk states through possibilistic fuzzy clustering. Instead of directly using a supervised classification method, we aim at identifying coherent groups of vulnerability with macro-financial indicators for pre-crisis data, and determine the level of risk for a new observation based on its similarity to the identified groups. The approach allows for differentiating among different possible pre-crisis states, and using this information for estimating the possibility of systemic risk. In this work, we compare different fuzzy clustering methods, as well as conduct an empirical exercise for European systemic banking crises. 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

"Grout, P.A.; Zalewska, A.",Stock market risk in the financial crisis,"In this paper, we look at the effect of the financial crisis from an angle overlooked to date in the finance literature by investigating composition effects arising from the financial crisis. A composition effect is a change in the market risk of a sector that is caused not by a direct change in that sector but by a change in another sector that affects the composition of the stock market. In the paper we investigate the pre and during crisis market risk of the industrial, banking and utilities sectors. Amongst otherwe find a positive relationship across the G12 countries between the increase in the market risk of industrials during the crisis and both the pre-crisis market risk of the banking sector and the scale of the systemic crisis in a country. The six G12 countries that experienced a major systematic banking crisis are amongst the seven countries with the largest increases in the market risk for industrials. drawn from our detailed analysis using US data are consistent with these findings. Finally, we show how the add to our understanding of the linkages between the financial and real sector and conclude that composition effects of the financial crisis could have a significant chilling effect on investment in industrials, which is in addition to the effect of other linkages already documented. 2015 Elsevier Inc..",2016,2016-01-01,20,International Review of Financial Analysis,banking sector; financial crisis; g01; g1; g15; industrials; market risk; systemic risk; utilities,,,"Grout, P.A.

"Ruiz, J.R.; Stupariu, P.; Vilariño, Á.",The crisis of spanish savings banks,"In a brief period of time, Spanish savings banks ('cajas') have changed from being considered a crucial explanatory pillar of Spanish economic development to being seen as synonymous with international systemic risk. This document aims to analyse the circumstances that have brought about this radical change. We will first explore the period between 1997 and 2007, characterised by sustained credit growth and the formation of a real-estate bubble of unprecedented proportions in the Spanish economy. We will then focus on two main aspects related to the banking regulatory framework: the implementation of dynamic provisions by the national bank supervisory authority (Banco de Espa a) designed to cope with expected losses rooted in procyclical bank lending behaviour and the role played by the implementation of the Basel II framework with respect to credit risk. This paper detects important deficiencies in the regulatory framework and supervisory process and concludes that these have been one of the main causes of the Spanish savings banks debacle.

"Klinger, T.; Teplý, P.",The nexus between systemic risk and sovereign crises,"This paper focuses on the relationship between the financial system and sovereign debt crises by analyzing sovereign support to banks and banks’ resulting exposure to the bonds issued by weak sovereigns. We construct an agent-based network model of an artificial financial system allowing us to analyze the effects of state support on systemic stability and the feedback loops of risk transfer back into the financial system. The model is tested with various parameter settings in Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses yield the following keyfirst, in the short term, all the support measures improve systemic stability. Second, in the longer run, there are settings which mitigate the systemic crisis and settings which contribute to systemic breakdown. Finally, there are differences among the effects of the different types of support measures. While bailouts and recapitalization are the most efficient types of support type and execution of guarantees is still a viable solution, the of liquidity measures such as asset relief or provision of funding liquidity are significantly worse. 2016, Faculty of Social Sciences.

"Pazzi, J.; Tohmé, F.",Fuzzy similarity and counterfactuals in the assessment of default risk: the eurozone crisis and the argentinean solution,"(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)1. The events that followed the 2008 financial crisis have shown that countries believed to be shielded against financial turmoil were much frailer than thought. Since then numerous voices pointed out the resemblance of the situation in the most challenged countries of the Eurozone with Argentina in 2001 5 10 15aAs it is well known, the convertibility of the Argentinean peso allowed the banks to carry dollar-nominated accounts, making their balance sheets susceptible to financial fragility at rapid exchange rate changes. While the latter were forbidden by law, the current account deficits and the increasing difficulties to pay back external obligations ended up forcing a default of the debt and a sharp and disordered devaluation of the currency. These events seemed, at the beginning, a source of endless mishaps but ended up (together with a rapid improvement of the international prices of Argentinean exports) creating the conditions for a fast rebound of the Argentinean economy 9 15a .It is no wonder then than a chorus of experts in various fields started recommending Greece (and eventually other EU members) to follow the Argentinean path 5 10 14 15a 17 18These arguments, based on rough analogies, deserve a closer analysis, which we intend to carry out in this paper. While this macroeconomic scenario has been analysed once and again in the macroeconomic literature (as well as by pundits and politicians), since the basis of comparison is a single case a strong justification in needed for making this assessment. Helmer and Rescher's13provide, fortunately, a sound foundation for such procedure. A counterfactual analysis based on the similarity of the two cases is the key. We focus here on such an exercise. To wit: are really the troubled euro-economies and 2001 Argentina so similar And, if so, to what extent should be expect them to default on their debt and abandon the euro, as seen in the perspective of the 2001 devaluation of the peso The answers to these questions require the formulation of an appropriate notion of similarity among economies and the exploration of means to infer future events out from analogies.The approach to be followed in this paper consists in applying Zadeh's25notion of fuzzy similarity to the comparison of the economic status of different nations. This formalization is intended to capture similarities among crisp objects. Nevertheless it is based on degrees of membership to sets of objects, namely those that satisfy some rather imprecisely defined (i.e. fuzzy) properties. While other approaches to similarity have been explored in the literature (e.g. 2 8 21 24ours provides the right combination of soundness and simplicity required by the particular problem at hand. We find that 2001 Argentina and the troubled Eurozone countries belong to a common (fuzzy) equivalence class. From this we will draw the degree of possibility to be assigned to a devaluation and change of currency in the light of the events in Argentina a decade and a half ago.The plan of the paper is as follows. In sectionwe will provide a conventional account of the current economic situation in some European countries and 2001 Argentina. In sectionwe will discuss the epistemological justification for counterfactual analyses and the conditions under which they can be performed. In sectionwe introduce a version of fuzzy similarity and its application to the evaluation of future consequences in similar situations. In sectionwe apply it to the comparison of the aforementioned economies and draw for the Eurozone. Finally, sectionconcludes.2.

"Barnett, J.","Global financial crisis: causes, consequences and impact on economic growth","The impact of the Global Financial Crisis was felt in 2008 and its repercussions are still with us today. In this book, the authors set the context for examining the crisis by looking at a regional crisis that occurred a decade earlier but whose lessons about financial fragility were soon forgotten. The authors then move to the present and discuss the views of a number of economics who to various degrees predicted or forewarned of the impending crisis. In the second chapter, the elements that caused the latest and current problems in the U.S. and consequently to all economists of the world, due to the systemic risk of globalization, are determined. The third chapter advocates the intangible and tacit knowledge in the knowledge based society of the 21st century, exacerbates the problem of moral agency in today's organizations, making the boundaries and accountability of decision-making especially vague and ambiguous. The authors apply this concept as a means to enhance the moral agency to organizations in the context of the knowledge based society, and as a key part of responsible leadership after the global financial crisis of 2008. The fourth chapter reviews aspects of the new rules that apply to investment firms and to banks, making comment on individual provisions as necessary. In the last chapter, the serious effects of a bubble and its burst in small countries in Central and Eastern Europe are looked at and discussed in detail. 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Santella, P.",Il nuovo regime europeo di risoluzione delle crisi bancarie: un’analisi comparata dell’applicazione del bail-in (A comparative analysis of the bail-in regime in europe),"The bail-in tool introduced in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and in the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) Regulation is aimed at increasing the efficiency of the crisis resolution mechanisms by applying penalties not just on bank shareholders but also on other classes of creditors. Bail-in allows to internalize the costs of bank failures instead of imposing externalities upon the rest of society through public bailouts. The final of the bail-in tool is then to encourage bank creditors to be more selective in their investment decisions and to take fully into account the adequacy of the bank's capital reserves to the desired level of business risk. The decision of the European legislator to apply bail-in to total liabilities instead of risk-weighted assets (as in the Basel III CRD IV framework) should facilitate market oversight over the level of capital and bailinable liabilities for each bank. The BRRD and the SRM Regulation provide that the bail-in tool may be applied either in order to recapitalize a bank or banking group and restructure it as a going concern, or to provide capital either for setting up a bridge bank, transferring the business to a third party or setting up an asset management vehicle. Certain liabilities may be exempted from the application of the bail-in tool if systemic risks would ensue. As the bail-in tool enables the authorities to restructure and recapitalize a bank without having to immediately separate the bank's critical functions from the non-viable part of the business, it is the resolution tool most likely to be used for large, complex and highly interconnected financial institutions, As it has been observed by some qualified commentators, for the largest banks systemic risks might emerge already for relatively limited levels of losses. Besides, presently the bailinable liabilities are largely held by creditors who made their investment ahead of the present legislation. Our study shows that in some EU Member States the average capitalization level for some of the largest banks is such that it would be necessary to apply the bail-in to a relatively high volumes of senior unsecured debt and other liabilities before the intervention of the Single Resolution Fund. Our study also shows that the bailinable liabilities with remaining maturity of at least one year those that represent the most solid basis for bail-in in some cases are lower than 15% of the total liabilities.",2015,2015-09-24,0,Social Science Research Network,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Banking union; Bridge bank; Single Resolution Mechanism; Basel III; Bank rate; Official cash rate; Financial system; Chinese financial system,,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2714757,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2714757 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2714757,biblio,,140-817-121-684-780,
"Baker, S.H.",Is fracking the next financial crisis A development lens for understanding systemic risk and governance,"Natural gas sits in deposits across vast regions of the United States, and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) is the current method used to extract it. Fracking for natural gas has been billed as the next economic boon to poor communities and the key to mitigating the negative effects of climate change. But fracking also involves risks: risks to our environment, to our communities, and to our markets. To date, the debate about frackingand efforts to address concerns about the risks of frackinghas largely been a debate about who should regulate, the federal government, the states, or some combination of the two. Framing the current fracking debate as a federalism question is a mistake. This Article argues that the narrow frame of the current fracking debate misses important features of the problem. It argues that fracking is best understood within the much broader context of development in the United States, and more specifically as an example of an approach to development called ""hybridity."" The Article maps hybridity as comprised of the following three key features: (1) private actors engaged in difficult-to-regulate activities, (2) involvement of public goods, and (3) creation of systemic risk. Drawing together the financial crisis of 2008, the BP oil spill of 2010, and fracking shows that all three share the common features of hybridity, and give rise to a similar suite of concerns. Regulation alone is not sufficient to address these concerns. Instead, the Article proposes several ways in which the hybridity of fracking might be disrupted, thereby easing the overall risks of fracking while realizing its potential benefits. Hybridity: An approach to economic development that is not easily regulated, engages a public good, and creates systemic risk.

"Kallianiotis, J.N.","The latest 'planned' financial crisis, which caused the first depression of the 21st century, was a moral and political crisis","The purpose of this research is to determine the elements that caused the latest and current problems to the U.S. and consequently to all economies of the world, due to the systemic risk of globalization. A recent historical retrospect is used to discuss the evolution of events before the crisis. The global uncertainty had increased the price of gold and the U.S. debts and deficits had caused a depreciation of the dollar, which with the help of speculators had heightened the price of oil until the Fall of 2014 and had created a commodity bubble. The deregulation in financial markets and institutions and the easy money policy had increased lending, corruption, speculation, prices in financial and real assets (even in food) and had caused an enormous bubble, which some people (the world planners) burst in 2008 and created the worst financial crisis, followed by the latest most severe recession in modern economic history. The moral and political crisis in the western free-market economies led them in deep recessions, enormous unemployment, annihilation of their wealth, complete distrust for the financial markets, a new cold war, and an elevation of terrorism. A theoretical model is used to describe the sequence of events first and to measure the benefits (gains) and costs (losses) to society by considering some macroeconomic variables and their deviations from the target ones. Then, we determine the factors affecting the variables of the economy (unemployment, prices, and real GDP) by taking into consideration policy variables (i.e., federal funds rate, taxes, and government spending). Nations and people face an absolutely uncertain future and the powerless world governments and regulators are just inactively watching the events that we are all part and responsible for this interdependent and complex world, which we created for the future generations. 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Poledna, S.; Molina-Borboa, J.L.; Martínez-Jaramillo, S.; Leij, M.v.d.; Thurner, S.",The multi-layer network nature of systemic risk and its implications for the costs of financial crises,"The inability to see and quantify systemic financial risk comes at an immense social cost. Systemic risk in the financial system arises to a large extent as a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange, and securities. The interplay of the various exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007 to 2013. We show that focusing on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90%. By assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected systemic losses are up to a factor of four higher now than before the financial crisis of 2007 2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of one thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates the total risk. The method presented here is the first data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels.",2015,2015-10-01,233,Journal of Financial Stability,,Credit risk; Economics; Finance; Financial crisis; Financial regulation; Financial risk; Financial risk management; Risk assessment; Risk factor (computing); Systemic risk,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Poledna, S.

"Hasan, I.; Massoud, N.; Saunders, A.; Song, K.",Which financial stocks did short sellers target in the subprime crisis,"Tracing the SEC ban on the short selling of financial stocks in September 2008, this paper investigates whether such selling activity before the 2008 short ban reflected financial companies’ risk exposure in the subprime crisis. Evidence suggests that short sellers sold short stocks that had the greatest asset and insolvency risk exposures, and that the short selling of financial firms’ stocks was not significantly greater than that of non-financial firms after we match them on firm size and insolvency risk. When the short ban was in effect, the market quality of financial stocks without subprime assets exposure had deteriorated to a larger degree than that of financial companies with subprime assets exposure. The findings imply that such a regulation may mute the market disciplining effects of investors and may also be seen as a counterweight to any perceived macro or systemic risk reduction benefits resulting from such a ban.",2015,2015-01-01,19,Journal of Banking & Finance,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Asset (economics); Financial crisis; Risk exposure; Subprime crisis; Insolvency; Business economics,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2014.12.021,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jbfina:v:54:y:2015:i:c:p:87-103 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5058712 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426614004026 https://www.suomenpankki.fi/fi/julkaisut/tutkimukset/keskustelualoitteet/Documents/BoF_DP_1503.pdf https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/950283-which-financial-stocks-did-short-sellers-target-in-the-subprime-crisis%3F https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v54y2015icp87-103.html,biblio,,109-863-898-475-543,

Each network in the system has its own topology, and the interactions among the system's networks change over time. In such systems, the lead into a crisis appears to be characterized by a decoupling of the networks from the keystone network. This decoupling can also be seen in the crumbling of the keystone's power structure toward a more horizontal hierarchy.

Two early-warning indicators for financial crises are identified: First, the algebraic connectivity of the equity securities network, as a measure for structural robustness, drops close to zero already in 2005, while there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an investigation of such nodes with respect to the structural stability of the global financial system.

We introduce a new framework for measuring systemic risk by using a risk-adjusted balance sheet approach. The measure models credit risk of banks as a put option on bank assets, a tradition that originated with Merton. We conceive of an individual bank’s systemic risk as its contribution to the potential sector-wide net. In this regard, the analysis of public commercial banks operating incountries from Central and Eastern Europe, shows potential risk which could threaten all the financial system.

"Moss, B.J.",Regulating and supervising systemic risk in the european unionresults of the post-crisis structural reforms,"This thesis contributes new and unique perspectives on the post 2007-09 crisis reform agenda established in the European Union. The focus of the thesis will be specifically on reform of the regulatory and the supervisory framework aimed at mitigating the effects of systemic risk. The starting point will be a review of the literature on the concept of systemic risk which will demonstrate that its unpredictable nature requires a malleable regulatory response. In light of the suggested areas of concern by the pivotal de Larosiere report’, analysis will be provided on the progress achieved so far. On the regulatory front, the systemic risk aspects of the various legislative measures introduced are assessed in terms of their relevance and potential effectiveness. The reformed supervisory framework under the new European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) requires close scrutiny due to the transfer of power to centralised authorities. Although the reform should be considered a success in terms of reaching itsin a timely manner, some critiques and suggestions will be provided on how to carry the framework forward. The thesis will also argue that taking the framework to the next step may require testing the boundaries of European Treaties and its case law in relation to delegation of powers. The measured success of the new framework could however be jeopardised by the recent of the first steps towards a banking union in the Eurozone. By creating a new supervisory dynamic within the EU, it will be argued that such a move raises the potential of creating a two speed’ model of financial supervision in the EU. Additionally it risks polarising the supervisory debate between the European Central Bank and the Bank of England at the detriment of the EU.",2014,2014-06-01,0,,,Economic policy; Accounting; Systemic risk; Relevance (law); Common law; Political science; Scrutiny; Banking union; European union; Legislature; Delegation,,,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/51062/,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/51062/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.668265,biblio,,014-525-674-035-606,
"Steiner, A.",Reserve accumulation and financial crises: from individual protection to systemic risk,"This paper provides a new perspective on the relationship between countries05F3 international reserve holdings and financial crises: while the ""local"" view holds that reserves may prevent domestic crises, it overlooks that the accumulation of reserves relaxes the financing constraint of the reserve currency country and may cause a financial crisis in the centre, which is transmitted globally. According to this ""global"" view reserve accumulation might destabilize the international financial system. Since the crisis affects all countries alike, the accumulation of reserves imposes a negative externality on non-accumulating countries. We integrate this idea in a theoretical model of the optimal amount of reserves and illustrate the gap between local and global optimality: the consideration of systemic risk lowers the demand for reserves. Moreover, if a supranational authority determines the optimal level of reserves, it internalizes the negative externality and accumulates fewer reserves. A macroprudential tax on reserve hoardings might implement the socially optimal solution. Our calibration analysis shows that these considerations are economically significant: they lower the optimal amount of reserves in the benchmark case by 45%. 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,2014-01-01,12,European Economic Review,financial crises; global imbalances; international reserves; macro-prudential policies; systemic risk,,,"Steiner, A.

"Battistini, N.; Pagano, M.; Simonelli, S.","Systemic risk, sovereign yields and bank exposures in the euro crisis","Since 2008, eurozone sovereign yields have diverged sharply, and so have the corresponding credit default swap (CDS) premia. At the same time, banks' sovereign debt portfolios have featured an increasing home bias. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two facts, and its rationale. First, we inquire to what extent the dynamics of sovereign yield differentials relative to the swap rate and CDS premia reflect changes in perceived sovereign solvency risk or rather different responses to systemic risk due to the possible collapse of the euro. We do so by decomposing yield differentials and CDS spreads in a country-specific and a common risk component via a dynamic factor model. We then investigate how the home bias of banks' sovereign portfolios responds to yield differentials and to their two components, by estimating a vector error-correction model on 2007 13 monthly data. We find that in most countries of the eurozone, and especially in its periphery, banks' sovereign exposures respond positively to increases in yields. When bank exposures are related to the country and common risk components of yields, it turns out that (1) in the periphery, banks increase their domestic exposure in response to increases in country risk, while in core countries they do not (2) in most eurozone countries banks respond to an increase in the common risk factor by raising their domestic exposures. Finding (1) suggests distorted incentives in periphery banks' response to changes in their own sovereign's risk. Finding (2) indicates that, when systemic risk increases, all banks tend to increase the home bias of their portfolios, making the eurozone sovereign market more segmented.

Design methodology approach: This paper aims to explore how banks have modified their behaviours since the subprime crisis and their influence on credit access for SMEs. Findings: We provide evidence that strategic orientations adopted by banks (both fragile and robust) are quite voluntary and not simply the result of following regulations. Unfortunately, these orientations have hampered SMEs' access to credit. Practical implications: The core result of the paper is to emphasize that banking behaviours have considerably changed just after the subprime crisis and that SMEs have to deal with this new reality. These findings could be of interest for regulators and banking authorities to control liquidity constraints and guarantee both the stability of the global banking system and sustainable economic growth.

"Oluwasegun, B.; Markose, S.M.","An multi-agent model of RMBS, credit risk transfer in banks and financial stability: implications of the subprime crisis","In this paper, we apply the agent-based modelling (ABM) simulation technique for the study of RMBS within banking and the implications for financial stability from the process of credit risk transfer. We design and develop a two-sector computational agent model using an insolvency risk constrained multi-period horizon model of profit maximisation with mortgage origination and securitization by banks on the one hand and the asset liability management activities of institutional investors who seek returns from equity and credit assets. The RMBS model for banks includes regulatory arbitrage from Basel capital adequacy, asset quality deterioration and default risk of loans. Our approach shows how the RMBS activity and the credit risk involved is incorporated into the portfolios of institutional investors and hedge funds who sought high return from the high risk tranche of credit assets. On this basis, we discuss the financial stability implications arising from the calibrations of two sectors where banking data relies on the FDIC data set and the default and coupon rates for credit assets come from the 2007 Citibank Report. Critical to issues such as whether there is an over supply of RMBS with an excessive high proportion of assets being securitized (typical rates of about 40%-49% being the case in the 2001-2002 for subprime originators) is found to lie in inappropriate coupon rates being paid on credit products based on high default RMBS and hence the costs of RMBS were not correctly factored. The implications of the passage of time for insolvencies to kick in can be observed in the agent based model. For instance, institutional investors with large portfolios of up to 38% or more of credit assets with default rates in excess of 10% could be insolvent by year 2. In such a case, the high Dutch Insurance Supervisory Board solvency margin of 30% for institutional investors did not appear to fare any better than a lower one showing that the collapse of market value for RMBS backed credit assets from high default by mortgagees is the dominant determinant of systemic risk. In its fully developed form, it is possible for the agent based model to articulate various components of the financial sector as shown in Figure 1.

"Dharan, S.",Derivatives making a comeback what should we know post-crisis,"With the economy showing signs of recovery, the exotic financial products are springing back.The demand for derivatives is once again growing as investors are trying to capitalize on the low interest rates. Notwithstanding the crisis, derivatives will continue to be useful and will serve as good hedging tools. The banks may continue to develop innovative products, even in a more regulated environment. At this juncture, it is important that the market entities take a step back to review the prevailing practicesBeing a former Structured Finance rating analyst of a leading Rating Agency in the years leading up to the crisis,feel compelled to educate the readers on the intricacies of the market in the pre-crisis years. Since the financial crisis,have been actively following the developments in the market and my efforts have been more geared toward studying the importance of risk assessment and its management.have come to realize that the market, going forward, primarily needs a holistic view of risk tolerance.am not writing this article with the intent of assigning responsibility for the crisis on any particular entity. However, as a former rating analyst,consider myself uniquely placed to ly present the idiosyncrasies of the market during this period. This should hopefully illustrate the importance of understanding risk to foster prudent investment decisions.As a professionally competent analyst within the group,was viewed as one capable of analyzing complex and intricate CDO transactions with ease.rated several hybrid CDOs that often times incorporated abstruse features, which were quite frankly, interesting to analyze. The increased risk appetite of the investors and the positive market sentiment encouraged the banks to come up with more complex derivative products. The period was marked by intense brainstorming sessions within the group. Everyone involved in the rating process was trying to get a grip on the features and their impact on the transaction ""deal"", in order to suitably incorporate them into the analyses. At this point,wish to elucidate a few of the qualitative features that increased the complexity in rating these products, particularly the hybrid asset-backed CDOs:1. A large proportion of the CDOs' Collateral began having synthetic references in the form of CDS (credit default swaps). While this was widely prevalent even in the past years, the transactions leading up to the crisis predominantly referenced sub-prime mortgage backed securities. The ease of having assets in the portfolio without physically owning it and with no constraint on the notional amounts had become increasingly appealing. In order to account for the credit risk and the liquidity risk, these hybrid CDOs needed liabilities in the form of super-senior swap arrangements or note purchase agreements through a variable funding note. These agreements, while trying to shield the deal from having to take huge losses, were intended to also give regulatory-capital relief.2. The Issuer (the seller of protection) serviced its obligations on these swaps through the use of ""eligible collateral"" that took the form of GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contracts), TRS (Total Return Swaps), Repos, other highly rated liquid assets that also included triple-A rated structured finance obligations or a combination thereof.3. Sometimes the deals also comprised of a percentage of ""synthetic shorts"" where the Issuer, under this arrangement, was the protection buyer. The primary motivation for these types of securities was to partially hedge a long exposure. The deals even had naked (uncovered) shorts wherein the portfolio did not include any long credit exposure to the reference entity. This was intended to mitigate the overall credit risk associated with the long or cash portfolio. However, if the swaps have unintended consequences the deal could get over-leveraged.When one is evaluating a deal with all of the aforesaid features, which are only a few of the many, their aggregate impact further augments the complexity of the transaction. For a rating analyst, the analysis typically involved extensive review of swap agreements confirmations in addition to the deal documents. The combined effect of multiple swap agreements to a transaction of this nature cannot be underestimated. The transactions also had complex cash-flow mechanisms ""waterfalls"" which needed be explicitly modeled in accordance with the agency's methodologies, while simultaneously accounting for the qualitative features. The robustness of the market necessitated appropriate methodology changes at the agencies. However the crisis has made it apparent that these changes did not totally account for the inherent risks in these securities. This could partly be attributed to the absence of sufficient historical data pertaining to the market at that time.The ramifications of these transactions on the market players, given their interconnectedness, have been humongous resulting in the financial crisis. The core of the crisis has only led us all to believe that the risks associated with these kinds of securities demanded a more in-depth understanding by the market.The rating agencies have understandably been under intense scrutiny by the market. Numerous other entities will also need to take responsibility for the fallout. As the growth in the Structured Finance market became rampant, the incentives for various players in the market started to get misaligned. As far as the rating analysts are concerned, there has always been a demand to churn deals out expeditiously. The analysts were rating a plethora of transactions prior to the crisis. These complex transactions were often tailored to meet the risk-returnof a specific class of investors that ironically possessed limited knowledge regarding these securities. To a certain extent, the proliferation of these complex transactions is consistent with over reliance on the rating agencies. Over-reliance without adequate fundamental analysis by the users can be detrimental. In order to make wise investment choices, the ratings need to serve as a complement to multiple data sources.The past few years since 2008 serve as abundant history, making it imperative for all concerned to take necessary actions to prevent such crises in the future. Regulators are making efforts through reforms to mitigate any potential crisis. The rating agencies need to continually review, revise and communicate their methodologies explicitly to the market. While there may not be a panacea for systemic risk, the effective way to mitigate risk will be through integrated efforts and cooperation among various market entities (structural, analytic and regulatory).",2013,2013-07-11,0,Social Science Research Network,,Structured finance; Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Credit default swap; Collateralized debt obligation; Swap (finance),,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2324304,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2324304,biblio,,158-301-700-493-408,
"Choi, Y.; Douady, R.",Financial crisis and contagion: A dynamical systems approach,"We use a multi-agent-based model to investigate and analyze financial crises where agents are large aggregates of the economic system under consideration. We analyze financial crises as the breakage of a dynamic financial equilibrium. We suggest that when the equilibrium is stable, a small perturbation is absorbed by the market. On the other hand, when the market becomes unstable, perturbations propagate and amplify through the system, and contagion and systemic risk occur, resulting in a global financial crisis. The market instability indicator is the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix of a dynamical system driving the evolution of the economy. Entries of this Jacobian matrix can be computed by estimating the elasticities of flows of funds between aggregate agents. The higher the elasticities, the larger the entries of the Jacobian matrix and the more unstable the economy. High leverage and borrowing capacity constraints increase elasticities and make the market unstable as soon as the market instability indicator is above the critical value 1. In order to avoid deflation and economic collapse in 2008, the US government had a very strong reaction with Quantitative Easing and TARP. This put the market under rapid oscillations of very high amplitude and chaotic behavior, making long term forecasts inefficient. By correctly monitoring and utilizing elasticities, governments facing a major crisis may be able to optimize the efficiency of monetary and fiscal policies and accurately allocate their support to the various sectors of the economy, as opposed to being part of the origination of market chaos by inappropriate allocation of government resources.",2013,2013-05-23,8,Handbook on Systemic Risk,,Financial economics; Butterfly effect; Systemic risk; Economics; Jacobian matrix and determinant; Economic collapse; Financial crisis; Quantitative easing; Monetary economics; Deflation; Mathematical finance,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9781139151184.024,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00666752 https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00666752/ https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1733706 https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-on-systemic-risk/financial-crisis-and-contagion-a-dynamical-systems-approach/6E0944AE3F848CE05D7C88A2ABE71BFA https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1733706 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1733706,biblio,,111-753-613-309-029,

"Wilczynski, R.",Financing instruments to combat the crisis,"Recent decades have witnessed a strong development of the financial sector, increasingly affecting the real economy. The surge in quantity, quality and diversity of financial market participants, instruments and procedures, as well as of resources, is indeed remarkable. Numerous studies have shown that, over time, financial development has been increasingly driven by two major factors: innovation and globalization. A wave of financial innovations has helped multiply the volume of available funding. Simultaneously, the process of globalizing the financial markets has progressed at an extraordinary space. It has been fueled by factors of different natures, such as the IT revolution, capital account liberalization, deregulation of financial sectors and cross-national expansion of huge financial institutions. Financial development feeds into the macroeconomic performance of individual countries and of the global economy. There is broad agreement that financial stability is desirable for economic growth. In particular, international financial stability is perceived as a non-rival, non-excludable public good (Kanbur 2002). As such, it should be pursued by all stakeholders with an interest in maintaining it, as a lack of stability entails undesirable costs for them. The issue of which system is the most conducive to the achievement of international financial stability as well as for reaping benefits to economic growth from financial development is, however, more debatable. One view being advocated is that international financial stability is, by and large, achieved via a system of competitive financial markets, which provides an adequate environment for independent policies of actors such as sovereigns and profit-maximizing investors. Such a framework helps avoid excess volatilities and positively affects growth. The concept of an efficient market can be traced back to the work of Samuelson (1965). A market-clearing mechanism appears to be instrumental to the efficiency of allocation. Within that approach, financial innovations and financial globalization are regarded as important facilitators of economic growth. Under the market system, incentives for innovations, such as profit-maximizing or risk-optimizing behavior, are strong. New and improved financial products, procedures and institutions pave the way for the expansion of economic activity by facilitating the process of trading and risk-pooling, by raising the percentage of savings available for investment, and by improving the allocation of capital and producing higher total factor productivity (McKinnon 1973 Levine 1997). These positive effects are enhanced when financial innovations are allowed to work worldwide. Free financial movements are considered fundamentally sound. An improved diversification of risk and better allocation of capital are beneficial not only to growth, but also to the stability of consumption (Fischer 1998 Summers 2000 Henry 2007). A contrasting view rests on the assumption of imperfect and inefficient markets. Inefficiency is attributed to such distorting factors as information asymmetries, herding behavior or principal-agent problems (Greenwald and Stiglitz 1986). Both financial innovations and financial globalization are producing and channeling considerable risks for the stability of the international financial system. In particular, the synchronized and simultaneous behavior of large fractions of market participants within the global financial network multiplies the effects of single decisions and leads to a systemic risk of excessive price volatilities. New financial products are complex and not well understood by all market participants, thereby reducing transparency and contributing to the underpricing of risk (Dorrucci and McKay 2011). Securitization and sales of products to distant investors bring about a weakening of lending standards. Fast profitseeking and innovative financial institutions attempt to lower their costs and, therefore, expand activities into the least regulated environment. It is further recognized that financial globalization is aggravating risks by producing cross-border externalities and spreading them worldwide. These developments activate and fuel the process of financial contagion across the globe. It is therefore argued that the system of free global financial markets tends to produce excessive volatilities when markets switch from euphoria to excessive pessimism which cannot be appropriately priced through a pattern of the risk premium and returns (Griffith-Jones 2003). In particular, international financial flows may not result in the equalizing of currency-adjusted and risk-adjusted rates of return everywhere. Abrupt, market-led adjustments undermine the stability of the international financial system. In small open economies different causes of financial stress are usually translated into problems in the balance of payments. This refers to both external factors, such as terms of trade shocks or sudden reversals of capital flows, and domestic factors, which include excessive budget financing needs or run-on deposits. External shocks are more likely to lead to balance of payments tensions in economies with non-reserve currencies, even if sound policies are pursued. However, large fiscal deficits and the accumulation of domestic debt may also add to external debt which is further increased by the usually depreciating currency. Recent decades have seen many balance of payments crisis episodes in emerging economies, from Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s, through East Asia, Russia and Brazil in the 1990s to Argentina, Turkey, Ecuador, Nigeria, Venezuela and several European economies over the 2000s. Increasing reversals in international capital flows have posed persistent risk to external balances in emerging economies. Some of these crises have ended as sovereign defaults. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, however, some advanced economies, particularly from the Eurozone periphery, were also affected by serious sovereign external problems. Financial imbalances tend to expand, usually at high speed, across sectors and countries. In 2007 the crisis in the local financial subsector initiated developments that have diffused externally, creating, over time, fears of a global currency war. The view challenging the efficiency of financial markets calls for an inevitable and active policy involvement required to address the balance of payment crisis. Financial contagion, which is speeding up and producing many considerable externalities, may create problems which cannot be dealt with exclusively by individual countries. Approaching international financial stability as a global public good implies, therefore, that coordinated, international actions are more effective than the market mechanism as instruments of response to a financial crisis. 2014 selection and editorial material, Andreas Pyka and Hans-Peter Burghof.",2013,2013-01-01,0,Innovation and Finance,,,,"Wilczynski, R.

"Bengtsson, E.",Fund management and systemic risklessons from the global financial crisis,"Fund managers play an important role in increasing efficiency and stability in financial markets. But research also indicates that fund management in certain circumstances may contribute to the buildup of systemic risk and severity of financial crises. The global financial crisis provided a number of new experiences on the contribution of fund managers to systemic risk. In this article, we focus on these lessons from the crisis. We distinguish between three sources of systemic risk in the financial system that may arise from fund management: insufficient credit risk transfer to fund managers runs on funds that cause sudden reductions in funding to banks and other financial entities and contagion through business ties between fund managers and their sponsors. Our discussion relates to the current intense debate on the role the so-called shadow banking system played in the global financial crisis. Several regulatory initiatives have been launched or suggested to reduce the systemic risk arising from non-bank financial entities, and we briefly discuss the likely impact of these on the sources of systemic risk outlined in the article.",2013,2013-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Business; Systemic risk; Investment management; Liquidity risk; Financial market; Financial crisis; Shadow banking system; Credit risk transfer; Business ties; Financial system,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dip:dpaper:2013-06,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dip:dpaper:2013-06 https://ideas.repec.org/p/dip/dpaper/2013-06.html,biblio,,074-398-899-655-547,

"Napoli, C.","Implications of the global financial crisis for financial reform and regulation in asia edited by masahiro kawai, davidmayes and petermorgan (review)","Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Financial Reform and Regulation in Asia. Edited by Masahiro Kawai, David G. Mayes and Peter J. Morgan. Cheltenham and Northampton: Edward Elgar Publishing and Asian Development Bank Institute, 2012. Pp. 296. The 2008 crisis demonstrated the fragility of financial markets and the systemic effects that individual banks can have on both financial systems and the real economy. The edited book Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Financial Reform and Regulation in Asia, jointly published by the Asian Development Bank Institute and Edward Elgar Publishing, offers a timely and thorough analysis of what the 2008 crisis has meant for Asian markets. As such, it fills a gap in the literature which, to date, has primarily examined the effects of the crisis on the economies of developed countries in the West. According to the authors, the book's central purpose is to identify the challenges imposed by the 2008 global financial crisis and suggest policy reforms. Within this context, the book examines the evolving regulatory framework for global finance and capital markets. The overarching conclusion is neatly summarized in a quote from Chapter 2, which states that ""the Westphalian principals of sovereignty that govern international financial oversight are not suited to the realities of an interconnected financial system"". Throughout the book, numerous examples are offered of the disconnect between financial regulation, which is typically national or regional, and finance, which is global. Based on these observations, the book offers recommendations for how financial systems can improve international cooperation through establishing macroprudential regulation, coordinating risk analysis, and increasing information sharing--which the book argues is a prerequisite for understanding and monitoring systemic risk. While the claim that international cooperation in finance needs improvement is not particularly innovative, the book adds value to the debate in four ways. First, while the arguments and analysis are technical, each chapter is well written and clearly presented. Moreover, the chapters are complimentary, meaning that although each section can be read in isolation, the whole book offers a rounded assessment of the challenges states face when trying to balance economic growth with financial stability. The rounded assessment is due in part to the fact that the authors come from diverse institutions from around the world, as well as the structure of the book, which is divided into four sections. Sectionsand II examine how Asian governments and regulators can strengthen financial surveillance and monitoring. Section III examines the role of the state in crisis management and resolution. The rationale for addressing both crisis prevention and resolution comes from the book's assertion that while improvements can be made to reduce the likelihood of financial crises, risk cannot be fully eliminated. Because of this, crisis resolution procedures must be developed and well understood. With the goals of prevention and containment, Section IV looks to the future, examining the pros and cons of Asia's rapidly developing bond markets, an important issue given the importance that sovereign and corporate debt play in economic growth. Second, in addition to the clarity and depth of analysis, the book offers innovative guidelines for regulating financial institutions in Asia and elsewhere.",2013,2013-12-01,0,Journal of Southeast Asian Economies,,Finance; Structured finance; Capital market; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial crisis; Macroprudential regulation; Geography of finance; Financial regulation; Financial econometrics,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-354660977/implications-of-the-global-financial-crisis-for-financial,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-354660977/implications-of-the-global-financial-crisis-for-financial https://muse.jhu.edu/article/536137/summary,biblio,,079-860-453-357-456,

"Hirschhorn, L.",The financial crisis: exploring the dynamics of imagination and authority in a post-industrial world,"This chapter explores the psychodynamics of the recent financial crisis.argue that we have reached a state of economic development where creativity is a productive force, and imagination is the human activity that propels creativity. The market,suggest, has become the projective screen for our imaginative capacities. But at the same time, the market itself creates systemic risks that require the exercise of authority and the subordination of imagination to rules and regulations. The result is a tension between imagination and authority. When poorly managed, this tension leads to crises. The chapter is divided into eight sections. In the first,argue that the 2007-8 financial crisis was less the result of imprudent decisions and more the result of what are called systemic risks’. In the second,link the idea of systemic risk to what we call within the system psychodynamics tradition, the group as a whole’ and the problem of authority. In the third,suggest that markets are attractive to the mind not because they are rational but because we project onto them our capacity to imagine.suggest this is so because increasingly imagination has become a productive force’ in the economy. In the fourth section,suggest that imagination as a psychic function integrates what Freud (1911) called the pleasure and reality principles, and that this integration takes psychological work to sustain. It is therefore prone to break down into one or the other of its constituent parts. When the pleasure principle wins out, the culture takes on a narcissistic color, and the sense of entitlement replaces the respect for authority.suggest that the behavior of some bank and financial-firm executives and their employees reflected this sense of entitlement. In the fifth section,argue that in our valuing of imagination, we therefore risk succumbing to the pleasure principle, which brings us into conflict with the authority system we need to manage systemic risks. But the authority system’s legitimacy is based on the useful work accomplished by the reality principle. Authority expresses the important idea that we must keep our narcissism and impulses in check in order to participate productively in the social world. We experience a conflict between the reality and the pleasure principles instead of their integration in imagination. In the sixth section,explore the learning from two innovations that William Halton introduced to the Group Relations conference: the resource planning and marketplace events.show how members’ experience in these events suggests that as imagination is broken up into its constituent parts, the reality principle and the pleasure principle each become social defenses for the other. In the seventh section,suggest that we replace the idea of social psychology with the idea of psychosociology, a term our French colleagues use, because, increasingly, social and political conflicts are the result of the projections of our mind onto society. The meaning of the classic tension between markets and central planning has been transformed.

Based on this measure, the systemic risk of European banks reached its height in late 2011 around 500 billion. We find that the sovereign default spread is the factor driving this heightened risk in the banking sector during the European debt crisis. The methodology can also be used to identify the individual contributions of over 50 major European banks to the systemic risk measure. This approach captures the large contribution of a number of systemically important European banks, but Italian and Spanish banks as a group have notably increased their systemic importance.

"Anginer, D.; Demirguc-Kunt, A.; Zhu, M.",How does deposit insurance affect bank risk evidence from the recent crisis,"Deposit insurance is widely offered in a number of countries as part of a financial system safety net to promote stability. An unintended consequence of deposit insurance is the reduction in the incentive of depositors to monitor banks, which leads to excessive risk-taking. This paper examines the relation between deposit insurance and bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading to and during the recent financial crisis. It finds that generous financial safety nets increase bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. However, during the crisis, bank risk is lower and systemic stability is greater in countries with deposit insurance coverage. The findings suggest that the""moral hazard effect""of deposit insurance dominates in good times while the""stabilization effect""of deposit insurance dominates in turbulent times. Nevertheless, the overall effect of deposit insurance over the full sample remains negative since the destabilizing effect during normal times is greater in magnitude compared with the stabilizing effect during global turbulence. In addition, the analysis finds that good bank supervision can alleviate the unintended consequences of deposit insurance on bank systemic risk during good times, suggesting that fostering the appropriate incentive framework is very important for ensuring systemic stability.",2012,2012-12-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Emerging markets; Business; Systemic risk; Unintended consequences; Deposit insurance; Safety net; Financial crisis; Moral hazard; Incentive; Monetary economics,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:6289,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:6289 https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/6289.html,biblio,,046-039-905-804-845,

"Schlaepfer, A.",Macroeconomic stabilization and the magnitude of financial crises,"The recent nancial crisis revealed a large exposure to systemic risk of the nancial sector after a relatively long period of high aggregate stability. This period of low macroeconomic uctuations, also called the Great Moderation, is often attributed to a successful policy of stabilization, including improvements in the conduct of monetary policy. This paper argues, using a standard banking model with inecient borrowing, that such stabilization policies during moderate times can increase the magnitude of a nancial crisis due to higher optimal risk exposure by nancial intermediaries. Taking into account amplication eects during a crisis, a stabilization policy may also result in higher aggregate volatility of output and lower aggregate welfare. Using historical data, this paper also provides empirical support for a link between macroeconomic stability and the severity of nancial crises.",2012,2012-01-01,0,,,Welfare; Empirical research; Monetary policy; Intermediary; Systemic risk; Economics; Stabilization policy; Monetary economics; Great Moderation; Volatility (finance),,,,,biblio,,142-659-396-482-071,

"Chaffee, E.C.",The role of the foreign corrupt practices act and other transnational anti-corruption laws in preventing or lessening future financial crises,"The most recent global financial crisis resulted in part from a failure of international law. Politicians and other regulators in the United States and abroad failed to effectively work together to create a consistent and proper level of regulation for the financial institutions, the mortgage-backed securities, and the credit default swaps that were at the heart of the crisis. As evidenced by the crisis, the globalization of financial markets within the past few decades has created new systemic risk in which national crises can quickly and easily spread across national borders. In the absence of greater coordination by politicians and other regulators in the United States and abroad, global financial crises are likely to occur with greater regularity and severity as the world continues to become more interconnected.Even if a cohesive web of international financial regulation can be developed, enforcement of the various strands of that web of regulation remains a concern. Remarkably, anti-corruption law has largely been ignored as a necessary component of financial regulatory reform. In the voluminous body of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the term corruption is not mentioned once, which is extraordinarily troubling.A robust and comprehensive system of transnational anti-corruption law is required to create stable global financial markets. The realities of an increasingly interconnected world precipitated the enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to prevent persons and other entities from engaging in activity that would corrupt foreign government officials. The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, and various other international agreements have helped to spread transnational anti-corruption laws throughout the rest of the world. The adoption and enforcement of these laws, however, remains incomplete. In the absence of a robust and comprehensive system of transnational anti-corruption laws, the global financial markets remain subject to greater risk of future financial crises. This article explores the current global system of anti-corruption law and explore how that system should and must evolve to prevent or lessen future global financial crises.",2012,2012-10-17,0,Social Science Research Network,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Law; Corruption; Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; Financial crisis; United Nations Convention against Corruption; Credit default swap; Financial regulation; Broker-dealer,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163150,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163150 http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2013/02/73.5.Chaffee.pdf,biblio,,161-002-460-568-324,
"Rossi, S.",Can it happen againstructural policies to avert further systemic crises,"elaborate on the structural causes of the global systemic crisis of 2007-9 to show that its ultimate origins lie in the still defective bookkeeping structure of national and international payment systems. As monetary circuit theory shows, banks are special, insofar as they can grant loans without the need to dispose of preexistent bank deposits. When the loans-generate-deposits causal chain occurs on the factor market, for firms to pay the wage bill, the money-output relation is not affected by banks' intermediation. This relation is modified when banks exploit the loans-generate-deposits mechanism for any financial market transactions, whether for their clients or for their own sake. Financial liberalization and deregulation pushed banks to compete with nonbank financial institutions, for them to retain their market share, reducing both their markup on monetary policy rates of interest and the credit standard they used to apply to firms as well as households. In that process, banks have, therefore, become ""financial supermarkets,"" engaged first and foremost in investment banking, which is a misnomer, because, in fact, it has nothing to do with investment properly speaking: it is speculation on ""global"" financial markets, which are indeed far from providing any support to productive investment within the economic system. 2011, Copyright Taylor Francis Group, LLC.",2011,2011-01-01,7,International Journal of Political Economy,bank money; financial crisis; payment systems; systemic risk,,,"Rossi, S.

The aim of this paper is to summarize the most important insights for competition policy that could be derived from the turbulent period 2008 2010. The financial crisis is seen as project that demanded sound management from competition policy and enforcement. The insights will be presented in the instructive form of lessons learnt’ which represents a common approved project management technique. We come to the result that the financial crisis is not the result of too much competition’, but of regulatory failure and that the main answers to the financial crisis have to come from smart regulation’. The relaxation of competition policy would be the wrong policy response in troubled times since competition policy can play an important role in bringing the crisis economy back on track. In contrast to banking we see no economic rationale for rescue packages for other economic sectors by referring to systemic risk. The renaissance of industrial policy is viewed with great skepticism since empirical evidence shows that the effort of picking winners’ all too often in saving losers’.",2011,2011-01-08,14,Empirica,,Systemic risk; Economic sector; Economics; Empirical evidence; Public finance; International economics; Financial crisis; Enforcement; Competition (economics); Market economy; Industrial policy,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10663-010-9163-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10663-010-9163-y https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/empiri/v38y2011i3p315-330.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-010-9163-y/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10663-010-9163-y.pdf,biblio,,125-758-712-083-839,

Apart from its place of origin in United States, more similarities can be tracked down. Both started in financial markets turbulence with its repercussions in decline in industrial production as well as world trade. Existing studies identify several categories of different causes that might have contributed to financial and subsequently economic crisis and its spread around the world. Short term explications point mainly to loose monetary policy, which kept interest rates lower than would have corresponded to real economic situation. In combination with revised Community Reinvestment Act, which enabled even lower-income population groups to invest into real estates, this was a start-up for real estate bubble and consequent problems of many financial institutions once this bubble burst out. However, long term factors of more fundamental nature should not be overlooked. Insufficient and or rather missing regulations of financial markets at which financial instruments of different kinds evolved during previous period bear its soured fruit. Nontransparent operations of investment bank reinforced with positive ratings of rating agencies, excessive securitization as well as underestimation of systemic risk led to moral hazard with its ramifications in bankruptcies of many financial institutions. Some experts claim that savings-investment imbalance across the world together with increasing oil prices, as well as prices of other raw materials and food have played its role in escalation of the whole problem too. Indubitably, all analysed factors have had its more or less significant impact on current economic situation.

Reflection shows that the fundamental causes of the subprime crisis are largely attributable to financial corruption arising from grave violations of financial information disclosure. Information supervision is an important check on financial corruption in that it serves as a means of regulating financial information disclosure and through transparency, reducing the demand for and supply of corruption. Drawing upon the recent reform of the US financial regulatory system and grounding ourselves on Chinese practice, we believe the reconstruction of the financial regulatory system should center on information supervision, with a focus on improving the system of information disclosure for financial bodies, building a unified financial information platform and an effective information-sharing mechanism, and integrating all supervisory resources into a unified and powerful force against financial corruption. 2011 Social Sciences in China Press.",2011,2011-01-01,0,Social Sciences in China,financial corruption; information supervision; subprime crisis,,,"Duoqi, X.

We then analyse the effects of the crisis on the performance of insurers in different markets and assess the extent of systemic risk in insurance. We conclude that, while systemic risk remains lower in insurance than in the banking sector, it is not negligible and has grown in recent years, partly as a consequence of insurers increasing links with banks and their recent focus on non-(traditional) insurance activities, including structured finance. We conclude by considering the structural changes in the insurance industry that are likely to result from the crisis, including possible effects on bancassurance activity, and offer some thoughts on changes in the regulation of insurance markets that might ensue. 2011 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.",2011,2011-01-01,62,Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice,credit risk; financial crisis; insurance; systemic risk,,,"Baluch, F.

The recent crisis has shown, on the one hand, that financial mitigations (i.e. capital requirements) are, per se, not sufficient to ensure the stability of the banks (which underpins the soundness of the entire financial system) and, on the other hand, the failure of the light-touch supervisory approach. The main research question is whether the improvement of ICG, involving proper protection for stakeholders and the switch to a more intrusive supervisory model, will be able to offset the failures of market discipline revealed by the crisis and, together with Basel 3’s reinforced capital adequacy regime, strengthen the resilience of the financial system, without the re of structural reforms.

We highlight implications for scholarship and practice, including: overcoming simplistic distinctions of scenarios as products or processes and as outputs or inputs. We assess the power of scenarios as frames and their role in re-framing strategic conversation and contrast the misapplication of probability in systemic risk analysis with the co-production of plausibility, between builders and users of scenarios.

The financial systems of core euro-zone countries were held to be fundamentally different from Anglo-Saxon ones and thereby less vulnerable to systemic risks, although there had been a shift towards more capital market-based financial systems amongst European economies. The core euro-zone countries had not seen house price booms on US or UK levels and associated consumption growth with greater provision of social housing there was not the same expansion of subprime lending. Nor had European countries run major external deficits-overall the euro zone was in approximate balance, with Germany running a clear surplus, and most of the member countries’ trade was conducted with each other. Indeed, the European Commission (2009, p. 48) recently asserted that Overall, the role of the euro area in global imbalances was negligible until the crisis broke’, rather overlooking the role of Germany’s large current account surplus.

"Goldin, I.; Vogel, T.",Global governance and systemic risk in the 21st century: lessons from the financial crisis,"Recent decades of globalisation have created a more interconnected, interdependent and complex world than ever witnessed before. While global policy has focused on facilitating integration, the implications of growing interdependence have been largely ignored. The acceleration in global integration has brought many benefits, but it also has created fragility through the production of new kinds of systemic risks. This article provides a framework for understanding these new 21st-century systemic risks and examines the challenges they pose to global governance. The 2008-2009 financial crisis will be used to illustrate the failure of even sophisticated global institutions to manage the underlying forces of systemic risk. We show this is symptomatic of institutional failure to keep pace with globalisation. The failure of the most developed and best-equipped global governance system, finance, to recognise or manage the new vulnerabilities associated with globalisation in the 21st century highlights the scale and urgency of the global governance challenge. 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley Sons Ltd.",2010,2010-01-01,69,Global Policy,,,,"Goldin, I.

"Bartlett, R.P.",Inefficiencies in the information thicket: A case study of derivative disclosures during the financial crisis,"Inefficiencies in the Information Thicket: A Case Study of Derivative Disclosures During the Financial Crisis Robert P. Bartlett, III Abstract: Conventional wisdom concerning the causes of the Financial Crisis posits that insufficient disclosure concerning firms’ exposure to complex credit derivatives played a key role in creating the uncertainty that plagued the financial sector in the fall of 2008. To help avert future financial crises, regulatory proposals aimed at containing systemic risk have accordingly focused on enhanced derivative disclosures as a critical reform measure. A central challenge facing these proposals, however, has been understanding whether enhanced derivative disclosures can have any meaningful effect given the complexity of credit derivative transactions. This Article provides an empirical examination of the effect of enhanced derivative disclosures by examining the disclosure experience of the monoline insurance industry in 2008. Like AIG Financial Products, monoline insurance companies wrote billions of dollars of credit default swaps on multi-sector CDOs tied to residential home mortgages, but unlike AIG, their unique status as financial guarantee companies subjected them to considerable disclosure obligations concerning their individual credit derivative exposures. As a result, the experience of the monoline industry during the Financial Crisis provides an ideal setting with which to test the efficacy of reforms aimed at promoting more elaborate derivative disclosures. Overall, the of this study indicate that investors in monoline insurers showed little evidence of using a firm’s derivative disclosures to efficiently resolve uncertainty about a monoline’s exposure to credit risk. In particular, analysis of the abnormal returns to Ambac Financial (one of the largest monoline insurers) surrounding a series of significant, multi-notch rating downgrades of its insured CDOs reveals no significant stock price reactions until Ambac itself announced the effect of these downgrades in its quarterly earnings announcements. Similar analyses of Ambac’s short-selling data and changes in the cost of insuring Ambac debt securities against default also confirm the absence of a market reaction following these downgrade announcements. Following a qualitative examination of how investors process derivative disclosures, the Article concludes that to the extent the complexity of CDOs impeded informational efficiency, it was most likely due to the generally low salience of individual CDOs as well as the logistic (although not necessarily analytic) challenge of processing a CDO’s disclosures. Reform efforts aimed at enhancing derivative disclosures should accordingly focus on mechanisms to promote the rapid collection and compilation of disclosed information as well as the psychological processes by which information obtains salience.

"Xafa, M.",Role of the IMF in the global financial crisis,"More than two years on, the impact of the financial crisis that erupted in August 2007 is still being felt as the global economy emerges from the Great Recession. The crisis intensified dramatically after the bankruptcy of Lehman and the rescue of insurance giant AIG in September 2008, which narrowly avoided a near-simultaneous failure of multiple counterparties. The International Monetary Fund's early forecast of the severity of the resulting economic downturn (IMF 2008a) helped mobilize concerted official action to address quickly and forcefully these extraordinary economic and financial events by providing fiscal stimulus to sustain growth, as well as capital injections and guarantees to ease the credit crunch. Following the emergency summit of G20 leaders in Washington in November 2008, support packages for banks were put together in a hurry in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere to prevent the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions and to restore confidence in the financial system. These unprecedented interventions prevented a meltdown and contributed significantly to signs of economic and financial stabilization since the spring of 2009. In this article,review the role of the IMF in the global crisis and argue that the Fund has emerged as a powerful institutional force, providing analysis and recommendations that have served as the basis of official action on several fronts. By contrast, the Fund was barking up the wrong tree when it focused its attention on the global imbalances and adopted the Surveillance Decision in the run-up to the crisis in 2006-07. IMF Policies and Reforms in Response to the Crisis The Fund helped shape the global policy response through its policy advice and spot-on analysis of global economic and financial conditions, contributing to the process of modernizing the global financial architecture. It was also quick to adapt its own surveillance activities and lending policies in response to the crisis. Lessons of the Crisis For IMF Surveillance The root cause of this crisis was the buildup of systemic risk due to regulatory and supervisory failure that was not adequately captured by the Fund's surveillance framework. The crisis has clearly demonstrated the need to improve the existing framework for assessing financial stability and to reinforce early warning capabilities in the advanced countries as well as globally. The global reach of the crisis also gave rise to calls for improved monitoring of cross-country spillover risks and their potential macroeconomic impact. At its October 2009 meeting, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) recognized that a reassessment of the Fund's role was in order and called on the Fund to review its mandate ""to cover the full range of macroeconomic and financial sector policies that bear on global stability, and to report back to the Committee by the time of file next Annual Meetings"" in 2010 (IMFC, 2009a). At the Committee's request, the Fund distilled the initial lessons even as the crisis was still unfolding (IMF 2009a) and is in the process of revising its policies and governance accordingly. Global Financial Stability The Fund's Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), published semiannually since 2003, assesses key risks facing the global financial system highlighting policies that can help mitigate systemic risks and enhance financial stability. In the Run-up to the crisis, the GFSR warned about rising credit and market risks associated with the growth in subprime mortgages embedded in complex, hard-to-price structured products (IMF 2006 and 2007a). Similarly, the World Economic Outlook (WEO) flagged some early concerns about the risks of house price bubbles in the United States and the dangers from large current account deficits in emerging Europe (IMF 2007b). However, the focus of this advice was not sharp enough to prompt policy action, and policymakers in the still-booming global economy were less receptive to the warnings.",2010,2010-09-22,12,Cato Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Credit crunch; Recession; Financial crisis; Global financial system; World Economic Outlook; Global imbalances; Corporate governance; Financial system,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-250134281/role-of-the-imf-in-the-global-financial-crisis,https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2010/11/cj30n3-5.pdf https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-250134281/role-of-the-imf-in-the-global-financial-crisis https://ideas.repec.org/a/cto/journl/v30y2010i3p475-489.html,biblio,,090-464-420-123-577,

"Ashton, P.",An appetite for yield: the anatomy of the subprime mortgage crisis,"Whereas policy makers and industry advocates have hailed the growth of the subprime mortgage market in the US as evidence that financial innovation can more efficiently price and absorb credit risk, the 2007 mortgage crisis provides an opportunity to revisit the nature of financial risk. This paper employs a forensic analysis of the development of the subprime market from the 1980s through 2007 to argue that, in a competitive environment marked by the greater integration between housing finance and capital equity markets, financial innovations provide new opportunities to hedge risk even as they collapse the barriers to rivalries between firms. This has changed the terrain for risk assessment, promoting new modes of financial competition that have intensified systemic risk and extended it to a widening set of firms, households, and communities. 2009 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",2009,2009-01-01,99,Environment and Planning a,competition (economics); financial crisis; financial market; mortgage lending; north america; risk assessment; united states,,,"Ashton, P.

"Thaicharoen, Y.; Roengpitya, R.; Chaowalit, J.; Rastapana, S.",Developing the efficient and resilient financial system for thailand: lessons from the crisis and challenges ahead,"The purpose of this paper is to discuss and raise important policy implications from the U.S. crisis in the Thai context, so as to contribute to the appropriate and forward-looking policy design for the Thai financial. Issues discussed in this study involve: (i) financial linkages and systemic risk assessment (ii) procyclicality of the financial system (iii) appropriate regulatory arrangement, bank governance and executive compensation. Regarding the systemic risk issue, we found evidence of negative externalities imposed onto the banking system value-at-risk (VaR) by banks and other types of financial institutions such as finance, securities and insurance companies. Therefore, bank regulators needs to be aware of the additional risk imposed onto the system during distress time and take this into account when assessing the risk level of banks. Next, the from panel data regressions suggested that the level of procyclicality decreased from the pre-Asian Crisis period when compared to the post-crisis period. Moreover, the nature of cyclicality differed by asset classes. Therefore, we proposed that, if their goal was to mitigate excessive cyclicality, supervisors must also take into account types of loans as well. Finally, the paper outlines the importance of implementing regulatory statues that will minimize regulatory arbitrage as well as promoting cautious financial innovations and bank governance, which were identified as a few of the fundamental causes leading to the onset of the U.S. financial crisis.",2009,2009-04-01,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Structured finance; Financial analysis; Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Financial risk management; Financial regulation; Financial system; Financial risk; Financial ratio,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bth/wpaper/2009-04.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bth/wpaper/2009-04.html,biblio,,014-385-480-066-920,

"Quinn, B.J.M.",The failure of private ordering and the financial crisis of 2008,"This Article analyzes the Financial Crisis of 2008 in the context of failures by market participants to engage in private ordering thus leading to opportunistic behavior at the expense of market stability. The Financial Crisis of 2008 offers a decidedly negative verdict on a decades-long project to deregulate financial markets and rely on private ordering mechanisms, including securitization and default swaps, to mitigate opportunistic behavior and improve market efficiency. Although the regulatory approach of the past two decades, which relied in great measure on private parties fending for themselves, helped to generate a number of innovations and positive developments in finance, it ultimately failed to bring about more resilient financial markets. The market for mortgage securitizations found itself subject to adverse selection biases leading to a lemons market for asset-backed securities. At the same time, developments in derivative markets made it possible for central actors there to engage in more risk (moral hazard) than was optimal. Ultimately, parties that should have engaged in private ordering did not. As a consequence, we are left struggling for a new regulatory path forward that recognizes that market participants are human agents subject to the frailties of cognitive limitations, euphoria and perhaps even the occasional self-delusion. What is required is a close examination of the institutional and micro incentives (including incentives of agents) in order to strike a balance between market-based regulation and a more interventionist approach to regulating markets. A more pragmatic approach to market regulation recognizes that the earlier hands-off approach to regulation resulted in over-reliance on weak heuristics and little by way of robust private ordering. A new more pragmatic vision of market regulation will likely stop short of legislating against bubbles, but could, and should, result in less systemic risk and a more sustainable growth trajectory going forward.",2009,2009-03-06,0,Social Science Research Network,,Finance; Market impact; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Financial market; Factor market; Indirect finance; Market depth; Market economy; Market microstructure,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354669,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354669 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1367914_code337481.pdf?abstractid=1354669&mirid=4,biblio,,122-105-086-951-370,

"Rancière, R.; Tornell, A.; Westermann, F.",Systemic crises and growth,"Countries that have experienced occasional financial crises have, on average, grown faster than countries with stable financial conditions. Because financial crises are realizations of downside risk, we measure their incidence by the skewness of credit growth. Unlike variance, negative skewness isolates the impact of the large, infrequent, and abrupt credit busts associated with crises. We find a robust negative link between skewness and GDP growth in a large sample of countries over 1960-2000. This suggests a positive effect of systemic risk on growth. To explain this finding, we present a model in which contract enforceability problems generate borrowing constraints and impede growth. In financially liberalized economies with moderate contract enforceability, systemic risk taking is encouraged and increases investment. This leads to higher mean growth but also to greater incidence of crises. In the data, the link between skewness and growth is indeed strongest in such economies.",2008,2008-01-01,168,Quarterly Journal of Economics,,,,"Rancière, R. (); Tornell, A. (); Westermann, F.

"Aglietta, M.; Rigot, S.",The regulation of hedge funds under the prism of the financial crisis,"This paper deals with two issues. On the one hand, it shows that structural changes in financial markets and in the hedge funds industry make the light-touch arguments for regulating hedge funds no longer relevant. On the other hand, pleas for stronger regulation of hedge funds are getting more attention. In the first part of the paper the huge expansion of the industry is outlined and the state of current regulation is highlighted. In the second part an in-depth analysis of risks associated with hedge funds is carried out. It is shown that systemic risk can arise from leverage and from concentration of exposures amongst hedge funds. The part played by hedge funds in the spread of the crisis of structured credit is portrayed. In the third section, the recommendations of professional organisations, regulatory authorities and international institutions are summed up within the framework of risk mapping. This oversight shows the ways of reform: the need of direct regulation, the enhancement of indirect regulation and the overhaul of securitization. The prospective pattern of regulation encompasses macro and micro issues, and impinges upon factors of demand and supply. It emphasizes the enhanced role of public regulators and displays the conditions of an effective market discipline performed by long run institutional investors.",2008,2008-01-01,7,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Business; Open-end fund; Alternative beta; Commodity pool; Institutional investor; Fund of funds; Hedge accounting; Prime brokerage; Global assets under management,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/drm/wpaper/2008-20.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/drm/wpaper/2008-20.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:drm:wpaper:2008-20,biblio,,138-920-261-158-612,

"Negro, M.D.; Kay, S.J.","Global banks, local crises: bad news from argentina","Banking crises have been a recurrent phenomenon in Latin America over the past few decades. Some have argued that the internationalization of the banking sector has ushered in a new era: what used to be systemic risk from the perspective of local banks with undiversified portfolios might no longer be systemic from the standpoint of large international banks. Argentina's experience shows that the presence of international banks was not enough to prevent local banking crises and sizable losses to depositors. The ""bad news"" from Argentina, this article argues, is that depositors in emerging markets may not reap the full benefits of international portfolio diversification because international banks have limited liability, at least under some circumstances-for instance, when the local government heavily intervenes in the banking system. The authors emphasize that while the limited-liability feature of international banks may seem bad ex post-and, of course, it is from the perspective of Argentine depositors-this feature may well be desirable, perhaps even necessary, ex ante. The article first presents evidence of the globalization of the banking sector in Latin America and the dramatic increase of the phenomenon in the late nineties. After reviewing the literature on the pros and cons of international banks in emerging markets, the authors focus on the legal issues behind the limited-liability feature. The authors examine the new evidence that Argentina's recent experiences provide and conclude by analyzing the pros and cons of the limited-liability feature.",2002,2002-01-01,16,Econometric Reviews,,Emerging markets; Ex-ante; Limited liability; Systemic risk; Retail banking; Latin Americans; Economics; International economics; Globalization; Financial system; Internationalization,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedaer/y2002iq3p89-106nv.87no.3.html,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedaer/y2002iq3p89-106nv.87no.3.html https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/delnegro/delnegro_kay03.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/article/fipfedaer/y_3a2002_3ai_3aq3_3ap_3a89-106_3an_3av.87no.3.htm,biblio,,095-803-792-557-232,
"A., S.",Financial crises in 1997 2001 shortcomings of the international financial architecture,"What economists and policy-makers for a long time had considered as virtually impossible has happened: except for North America and Europe, since 1997 the world financial system has moved with dazzling speed from crisis to crisis. Major countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America collapsed or fell prey to the contagiousness of the crisis. It all started in Thailand in the summer of 1997, quickly spread to other South-East Asian countries, dragged down Japan, infested Russia and spread to Latin America. The starting point in South East Asia is all the more remarkable as these economies were admired world-wide for their achievements and the World Bank surely a very involved and knowledgeable institution wondered in a publication of 1993 about explanations for the ""Asian miracle"". And, indeed, these countries had accomplished the miracle of lifting themselves out of poverty during the last 20 30 years. Their success was sustained for several decades. And this success was achieved despite or because of, a social organisation in opposition to Western values: all these countries had limited democracy and, instead, substantial oligarchic structures with widespread corruption and extensive import protection and state involvement. But they were successful. Hence the search for ""Asian values"" to understand the ""Asian miracle"". Had the crisis with a major financial turmoil including currency collapse, widespread bankruptcy of the banking and corporate sector, drop in GDP been linked to Asia one could have argued that special Asian factors (excessively rapid growth, corruption, fixed exchange rates, etcwere at work. But in the meantime the list of victims of financial turmoil lengthened: Russia, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey. And whilst Korea and Malaysia came out of the crisis relatively unscathed, Indonesia is still on the brink. Are there lessons to be drawn The first lesson of the crisis is that there is much more systemic risk than previously admitted. In 1997 and 1998 lenders and investors had reconsidered emerging market risk as a whole and changed tack abruptly, without a clear change in fundamentals. The second is that the IMF's surveillance does not work as well as assumed and that the IMF has difficulties in effectively stemming an unfolding crisis. The world markets have become more global, but international institutions have not kept pace. The official mission of the IMF is to assist countries with a balance of payments problem. But in fact the IMF is expected to carry out surveillance to prevent financial crises and their spreading to other countries and to assist countries with international liquidity problems. It would be unreasonable to expect the IMF to deal well with all these expectations for which it was not set up. This paper argues that the IMF, more often than not, has made the severity of a crisis worse.",2001,2001-01-01,0,European Research Studies Journal,,Finance; Balance of payments; Emerging markets; Currency; Systemic risk; Economics; Poverty; Corruption; Carry (investment); Asian values; Development economics,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ers/journl/vivy2001i1-2p61-72.html,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ers/journl/vivy2001i1-2p61-72.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ers:journl:v:iv:y:2001:i:1-2:p:61-72,biblio,,120-486-863-443-135,
"Kaufman, G.G.; Seelig, S.A.","Post-Resolution treatment of depositors at failed banksimplications for the severity of banking crises, systemic risk, and too-big-to-fail","Losses may accrue to depositors at insolvent banks both at and after the time of official resolution. Losses at resolution occur because of poor closure rules and regulatory forbearance. Losses after resolution occur if depositors' access to their claims is delayed or ""frozen."" While the sources and implications of losses at resolution have been analyzed previously, the sources and implications of losses after resolution have received little attention. This paper examines the causes of delayed depositors' access to their funds at resolved banks, describes how the FDIC provides immediate access, reports on a special survey of access practices in other countries, and analyzes the costs and benefits of delayed access in terms of both the effects on market discipline and depositor pressure to protect all deposits.",2001,2001-01-01,6,Imf Working Papers,,Forbearance; Business; Systemic risk; Bank failure; Deposit insurance; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Market discipline; Insolvency; Financial system,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5089/9781451850543.001,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/_wp0183.ashx https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/30/Post-Resolution-Treatment-of-Depositors-At-Failed-Banks-Implications-for-the-Severity-of-15139,biblio,,093-186-900-671-611,
