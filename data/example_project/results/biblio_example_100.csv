"Dambra, S.; Bilge, L.; Balzarotti, D.",A comparison of systemic and systematic risks of malware encounters in consumer and enterprise environments,"Malware is still a widespread problem, and it is used by malicious actors to routinely compromise the security of computer systems. Consumers typically rely on a single AV product to detect and block possible malware infections, while corporations often install multiple security products, activate several layers of defenses, and establish security policies among employees. However, if a better security posture should lower the risk of malware infections, then the actual extent to which this happens is still under debate by risk analysis experts. Moreover, the difference in risks encountered by consumers and enterprises has never been empirically studied by using real-world data.In fact, the mere use of third-party software, network services, and the interconnected nature of our society necessarily exposes both classes of users to undiversifiable risks: Independently from how careful users are and how well they manage their cyber hygiene, a portion of that risk would simply exist because of the fact of using a computer, sharing the same networks, and running the same software.In this work, we shed light on both systemic (i.e., diversifiable and dependent on the security posture) and systematic (i.e., undiversifiable and independent of the cyber hygiene) risk classes. Leveraging the telemetry data of a popular security company, we compare, in the first part of our study, the effects that different security measures have on malware encounter risks in consumer and enterprise environments. In the second part, we conduct exploratory research on systematic risk, investigate the quality of nine different indicators we were able to extract from our telemetry, and provide, for the first time, quantitative indicators of their predictive power.Our show that even if consumers have a slightly lower encounter rate than enterprises (9.8% vs. 12.0%), the latter do considerably better when selecting machines with an increasingly higher uptime (89% vs. 53%). The two segments also diverge when we separately consider the presence of Adware and Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA) and the generic samples detected through behavioral signatures: While consumers have an encounter rate for Adware and PUA that istimes higher than enterprise machines, those on average match behavioral signaturestimes more frequently than the counterpart. We find, instead, similar trends when analyzing the age of encountered signatures, and the prevalence of different classes of traditional malware (such as Ransomware and Cryptominers). Finally, our findings show that the amount of time a host is active, the volume of files generated on the machine, the number and reputation of vendors of the installed applications, the host geographical location, and its recurrent infected state carry useful information as indicators of systematic risk of malware encounters. Activity days and hours have a higher influence in the risk of consumers, increasing the odds of encountering malware of 4.51 and 2.65 times. In addition, we measure that the volume of files generated on the host represents a reliable indicator, especially when considering Adware. We further report that the likelihood of encountering Worms and Adware is much higher (on averagetimes in consumers and enterprises) for those machines that already reported this kind of signature in the past. 2023 Copyright held by the owner author(s).

"Müller, F.M.; Santos, S.S.; Righi, M.B.",A description of the COVID-19 outbreak role in financial risk forecasting,"This study aims to describe the risk of the system composed on the market indexes of the countries that were more affected by COVID-19. Our sample encompasses the thirty-five countries with more cases and or deaths caused by COVID-19 until November 2020. As a second contribution, we describe the risk of each market index individually. As a general pattern, we note that losses and individual and systemic risks peaked in March 2020. We verify that countries that were epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced critical levels of risk, which is partially explained by more stringent confinement measures since these are the ones whose labor markets will suffer more in the medium and long run. We perceived a market recovery, arguably due to the low-interest rates and expansive actions taken by central banks. Nonetheless, we also observed that the systemic risk returned to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2020. 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023,2023-01-01,0,North American Journal of Economics and Finance,covid-19; single-index risk; systemic risk,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Müller, F.M.

Despite this, experts in the business domain have identified significant limitations in the existing approaches. Thus, we proposed a new variant of the CRA quantum algorithm to address these limitations. In particular, we improved the risk model for each asset in a portfolio by enabling it to consider multiple systemic risk factors, resulting in a more realistic and complex model for each asset’s default probability. Additionally, we increased the flexibility of the loss-given-default input by removing the constraint of using only integer values, enabling the use of real data from the financial sector to establish fair benchmarking protocols. Furthermore, all proposed enhancements were tested both through classical simulation of quantum hardware and, for this new version of our work, also using QPUs from IBM Quantum Experience in order to provide a baseline for future research. Our proposed variant of the CRA quantum algorithm addresses the significant limitations of the current approach and highlights an increased cost in terms of circuit depth and width. In addition, it provides a path to a substantially more realistic software solution. Indeed, as quantum technology progresses, the proposed improvements will enable meaningful scales and useful for the financial sector.",2023,2023-03-31,0,Entropy,,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Dri, E.

The concept of ""too connected to fail"" suggests that network connectedness plays an important role in measuring systemic risk. In this paper, we first recover a time series of Bayesian networks for stock returns, which allow the direction of links among stock returns to be formed with Markov properties in directed graphs. We rank the stocks in the time series of Bayesian networks based on the topological orders of the stocks in the learned Bayesian networks and develop an order distance, a new measure with which to assess the changes in the topological orders of the stocks. In an empirical study using stock data from the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we use the order distance to predict the extreme absolute return, which is a proxy of extreme market risks, or a signal of systemic risks, using the LASSO regression model. Our indicate that the network statistics of the time series of Bayesian networks and the order distance substantially improve the predictability of extreme absolute returns and provide insights into the assessment of systemic risk.",2023,2023-01-20,0,Plos One,"advance directives; bayes theorem; hong kong; models, economic; time factors",,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Chan, L.S.H.

"Du, X.; Ren, Y.",A study on the systematic importance of major banks in china,"In recent years, the outbreak of the global financial crisis has made people aware of the threat of the existence of systemic risk to the financial system. In the financial system, there are some banking-type financial institutions that have a pivotal position due to their large scale and other reasons and have a greater influence on systemic financial risks, so the identification and supervision of such financial institutions are very important. In China, banks occupy an important position among various financial institutions, and the main content of this paper is to identify the systemically important banks in China. In the research process, we refer to international disclosures and previous studies to determine the assessment models for different types of banks, then substitute the data of selected institutions to derive their systemic importance scores, select the threshold values to identify systemically important banks, explain the assessmentand finally propose policy recommendations based on the assessment .KeywordsSystemically important banksIndicator methodEntropy method",2023,2023-01-01,0,"Education, Research and Business Technologies",,Systemic risk; China; Position (finance); Financial crisis; Business; Identification (biology); Financial system; Scale (ratio); Finance; Economics; Political science; Geography; Botany; Cartography; Biology; Law; Macroeconomics,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-6755-9_29,,biblio,,182-618-487-206-347,

The study aims to investigate the predisposing factors, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of culture-proven cases of Actinomycotic primary canaliculitis. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective, interventional case series. Culture-proven cases of Actinomyces-associated primary canaliculitis diagnosed and treated between January 2017 and December 2021 at the Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Capital Medical University were identified and reviewed for ocular and systemic risk factors, clinical presentations, microbiological profile, treatment modalities and outcomes.Of the 201 patients diagnosed with primary canaliculitis, 22 (10.9%) were caused by Actinomyces. The mean age at onset of 22 patients (21 women and one men) was 54 years. The lower canaliculus was most commonly involved (54.6%). The most frequent symptom was mattering without epiphora (77.3%) and clinical signs were punctal regurgitation of purulent discharge (100%) and expressible concretions (95.5%). Dry eye co-existed in 77.3% of patients, whereas no obvious systemic factors were found. Among 19 cases (86.0%) of identified Actinomyces species, A. odontolyticus (43.5%) was the predominant causative microorganism. There were 50% of patients with polymicrobial infection and the most common additional bacteria isolated were Streptococcus species. Conservative therapy combining repeated canalicular expression and irrigation with susceptible topical antibiotics achieved complete resolution in 86.4% of patients.Dry eye was identified in the vast majority of patients with Actinomycotic canaliculitis. Most cases are odontogenic in origin and the infection occurs in immunocompetent individuals.

"Zheng, Z.; Yan, M.; Li, L.; Zhang, D.; Zhang, L.",Analysis of ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness in retinal vein occlusion with resolved macular edema,"Purpose: To analyze the retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) changes in retinal vein occlusion (RVO) eyes with resolved macular edema using optical coherence tomography. Methods: We compared the average and minimum GCIPL thickness in RVO eyes with fellow eyes and healthy controls including 40 unilateral RVO patients and 48 healthy subjects. The average GCIPL thickness in BRVO eyes was segmented into the affected and opposite area according to the site of lesion, comparing them with corresponding areas in fellow eyes. Furthermore, maximum central macular thickness (CMT), visual acuity (VA), and intravitreal injection times were recorded to investigate their relationship with the GCIPL thickness.Despite no significant difference in CMT (P 0.96), the average (P 0.02 andlt 0.001, respectively) and minimum (bothlt 0.001) GCIPL thicknesses were decreased in RVO eyes with resolved macular edema after treatment in comparison to fellow eyes and healthy eyes. Maximum CMT thickness was negatively correlated with the minimum GCIPL thickness (r 0.47,0.003). VA and average GCIPL thickness were associated (rs 0.49,0.002). In a subgroup analysis that only included BRVO patients, the opposite area revealed no significant difference between two eyes (P 0.91) although the affected area in BRVO eyes was decreased (P lt 0.001).A decrease of GCIPL thickness in RVO was observed even after anatomic restoration and associated with VA prognosis. These GCIPL defects could be attributable to systemic risks and RVO itself, not anti-VEGF effects. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,0,International Ophthalmology,"adult; article; central macular thickness; clinical article; clinical feature; complication; controlled study; female; follow up; follow-up studies; human; humans; macular edema; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; pathology; procedures; prognosis; retina ganglion cell; retina vein occlusion; retinal ganglion cells; retinal inner plexiform layer; retinal vein occlusion; retrospective study; risk factor; systemic factors; tomography, optical coherence; visual acuity",Anatomy; Branch retinal vein occlusion; Edema; Ganglion; Macular edema; Medicine; Occlusion; Ophthalmology; Optical coherence tomography; Retinal; Retinal Vein; Surgery; Visual acuity,32 biomedical and clinical sciences; 3212 ophthalmology and optometry,"Zheng, Z.

This study aimed to compare and analyze systemic and serum risk factors for nAMD and PCV in an aging Chinese population. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 108 patients with nAMD, 131 patients with PCV, and 219 control subjects. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein(APOB), complement(C3), and complement(C4) together with data on systemic risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and asthma, were collected. Chi-square tests, independent-samplestests, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of risk factors with nAMD and PCV.Patients with PCV and those with nAMD were likely to have hyperlipidemia (P 0.05), DM was associated with PCV development (OR 0.535,0.044). Regarding serum risk factors, HDL, LDL, TG, APOB, and C3 were significantly associated with nAMD (OR 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that hyperlipidemia is significantly associated with both nAMD and PCV. Serum lipid and complement levels have an effect on the pathogenesis of nAMD and PCV, and consideration of the differences between systemic and serum risk factors should be taken into account in clinical management. 2023, The Author(s).",2023,2023-01-01,1,Ophthalmology and Therapy,adult; age related macular degeneration; age-related macular degeneration; aged; aging; apolipoprotein a1; apolipoprotein b; article; asthma; case control study; cohort analysis; complement component c3; complement component c4; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; dilated fundus examination; eye examination; female; fluorescein fundus angiography; fluorescence angiography; genetic susceptibility; high density lipoprotein; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; indocyanine green angiography; lipid blood level; low density lipoprotein; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; retrospective study; risk factor; risk factors; serum risk factor; slit lamp microscopy; systemic risk factor; triacylglycerol; visual acuity,,32 biomedical and clinical sciences; 3212 ophthalmology and optometry,"Tao, T.

Traditionally, PAD refers to diseases of the arteries outside of the coronary circulation, including carotid, visceral and lower extremity peripheral artery disease, and the heterogeneity of PAD patients is represented by different atherothrombotic pathophysiology, clinical features and related antithrombotic strategies. The risk in this diverse population includes systemic risk of cardiovascular events as well as risk related to the diseased territory (e.g., artery to artery embolic stroke for patients with carotid disease, lower extremity artery to artery embolism and atherothrombosis in patients with lower extremity disease). Moreover, until the last decade, clinical data on antithrombotic management of PAD patients have been drawn from subanalyses of randomized clinical trials addressing patients affected by coronary artery disease. The high prevalence and related poor prognosis in PAD patients highlight the pivotal role of tailored antithrombotic therapy in patients affected by cerebrovascular, aortic and lower extremity peripheral artery disease. Thus, the proper assessment of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk in patients with PAD represents a key clinical challenge that must be met to permit the optimal antithrombotic prescription for the various clinical settings in daily practice.

Preliminary screening trials along with systemic risk analysis were performed, endeavouring to explicate the critical method attributes, namely pH, percentage of orthophosphoric acid and percentage of acetonitrile, that influence the critical quality attributes. Box-Behnken design was utilized for the optimization of the tailing factor as the response for MTX and BCL in a short run time. The chromatographic conditions were optimized by performing 17 experimental runs using design expert software. The chromatographic conditions were selected after the analysis of the optimized zone within the confines of the design space: water:acetonitrile adjusted to a pH of 3.0 with 0.05% orthophosphoric acid (60:40, %v v) was the mobile phase, the flow rate was 1.0 ml min and an analytical C18 column was used at an isobestic wavelength of 282 nm. Furthermore, the optimized method was validated in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines and was found to be within the prescribed limits.

We aimed to determine the associations of inflammatory, metabolic, malnutrition, and frailty indexes with multimorbidity onset and progression and their predictions of multimorbidity-associated mortality risk. METHODS: A prospective cohort study (Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study SLASof 5,089 community-dwelling older adults aged 55 years in two waves of recruitment (SLAS-1: March 2005-September 2007, SLAS-2: January 2013-August 2018). Baseline variables included inflammatory (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR)) and metabolic profiles (atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), triglyceride-glucose index of insulin resistance (TyG)), physical frailty, and nutritional risk (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), Nutritional Screening Initiative (NSI), Elderly Nutritional Indicators for Geriatric Malnutrition Assessment (ENIGMA)). At follow-up, 3-5 years after the baseline interview, incident multimorbidity2 chronic diseases) was determined among multimorbidity-free participants (N 1,657) and worsening multimorbidity (increase of chronic diseases) among participants with baseline multimorbidity (N 1,207). Mortality in all participants and those with multimorbidity (N 2,291) was determined up to 31 December, 2016. Odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated in multivariate logistic and Cox regression models, in base model adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity, housing type, smoking, and a number of comorbidities, and further stepwise selection adjustment for other systemic risk indexes.At baseline, NLR, LMR, AIP, TyG, physical frailty, ENIGMA, NSI, and MNA-SF were significantly associated with prevalent multimorbidity (p 0.001). Among multimorbidity-free participants, LMR, TyG, and ENIGMA were significantly associated with incident multimorbidity in both the base model and further stepwise selection models: LMR (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.94), TyG (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.06-1.75), and ENIGMA (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.30). Among participants with baseline multimorbidity, NLR, LMR, and TyG significantly predicted worsened multimorbidity at follow-up in base model analysis, and LMR (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86) and TyG (OR 1.96, 95% CI: 1.24-3.09) remained as independent predictors in further stepwise selection models. Among participants with prevalent multimorbidity, NLR, TyG, frailty, MNA, and ENIGMA were significantly associated with mortality risk with base model adjustments and further stepwise selection models: NLR (HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10-1.32), TyG (HR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.54), frailty (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10-1.36), ENIGMA (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), MNA (HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97). A combined systemic risk index shows increasing quartiles, adjusted for age, sex, housing, and smoking status, significantly predicting mortality risk. DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: The onset and progression of multimorbidity and its mortality impact are driven by systemic factors, including inflammation, metabolic dysfunction (insulin resistance), malnutrition, and frailty.

Design methodology approach: This paper introduces a tractable guarantee network model that captures the invulnerability of the network in terms of cascade-based attack. Furthermore, the equilibrium points are introduced for banks to determine loan origination. Findings: The proposed approach not only develops equilibrium analysis as an extended perspective in the guarantee network, but also applies cascading failure method to construct the guarantee network. The equilibrium points are examined by simulating experiment. The invulnerability of the guarantee network is quantified by the survival of firms in the simulating progress. Research limitations implications: There is less study in equilibrium analysis of the guarantee network. Additionally, cascading failure model is expressed in the presented approach. Moreover, agent-based model can be extended in generating the guarantee network in the future study. Originality value: The approach of this paper presents a framework to analyze the equilibrium of the guarantee network. For this, the systemic risk of the whole guarantee network and each node's contribution are measured to predict the probability of default on cascading failure.

This has resulted in a call from the scientific community to adopt a systemic risk perspective on drought. However, a thorough understanding of how drought risks manifest, cascade and interact across different systems and sectors is still lacking, and methodological guidance on how to analyse and represent these interdependencies does not yet exist. amp amp 160 In order to explore these gaps, we have developed conceptual models of drought risks for key selected systems and sectors in the European Union. amp amp 160 amp ltamp gt amp ltamp gt For each system and sector considered (rain fed and irrigated agricultural systems, forest ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, public water supply, inland water transport and the energy sector), a conceptual model was constructed to depict how drivers and root causes interact to create drought risk. The models are based on the impact chains methodology and are informed by literature review and multiple expert consultations (including a series of validation workshops). Subsequently, the system-specific models were used to build an overarching conceptual model of the critical interdependencies that exist between all the systems and sectors considered. amp amp 160 amp ltamp gt amp ltamp gt The analysis has revealed that, in each system, drought risks manifest through a complex web of interactions between drivers of risk, which are in part system-specific and in part shared across the systems considered. From this, multiple considerations for drought risk assessment and management can be derived. In particular, special attention should be placed in defining and representing what drought risk is in each system, as the underlying characteristics might greatly differ. Additionally, the use of conceptual models can constitute an important first step for risk assessment, as they contribute to addressing the complexity of drought risks. Finally, the existence of commonalities and interdependencies between systems implies that interventions can and must be designed so as to consider multiple systems at once, thus avoiding maladaptive solutions. In this sense, the conceptual models can serve as entry points for the identification of risk reduction and adaptation measures which go beyond the single-risk and single-sector perspective, thus contributing to a more systemic view on drought risk management and adaptation, as well as highlighting persisting knowledge gaps. amp ltamp gt",2023,2023-02-25,0,,,Interdependence; Systemic risk; Vulnerability (computing); Environmental resource management; Conceptual model; Business; Conceptual framework; Agriculture; Perspective (graphical); Environmental science; Economics; Computer science; Ecology; Political science; Biology; Sociology; Social science; Financial crisis; Computer security; Database; Artificial intelligence; Law; Macroeconomics,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-7991,,biblio,,171-416-315-031-056,
"Krishtanosov, V.B.; Brovko, N.A.",Conceptual-Analytical approaches to threats in the digital economy,"The study’s relevance is determined by the significant impact that digitalization has on the economic and social activities of modern states, which engenders new risks and threats to the functioning of va rious systems and institutions. Based on the evolutionary-institutional analysis and systems analysis methods, the study identifies the threats of digitalization and the associated macroeconomic risks and describes the current approaches to digital risk management. The evolution in the understanding of risk and contemporary approaches to risk assessment is traced in relation to business, social, economic, investment, military, and political threats. Among the critical risks of digitalization, an important place is occupied by cyber risks, which are part of the strategic risks of enterprises, credit risks and regulatory risks. These risks affect markets and create a systemic risk stemming from the possible damage to elements of the infrastructure and market. Technology-driven risks have a systemic character as they may affect more than one country, economic sector, as well as a wide range of natural, technological, and social systems. The study offers an analysis of digitalization risk assessment methods (STRIDE, CIA, OCTAVE) and provides an overview of the qualitative and quantitative methods used to assess digital threats. Modern approaches to cyber risk management include modeling threats and vulnerabilities. These methods may prove especially useful to identify, classify and prioritize threats and to develop selective risk reduction measures. The concepts of FinTech and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) are discussed in relation to the associated risks to the stability of national and international financial systems.

Conversion strategies are intended to transform one or multiple supply chain functions for a different one to manage the changing environment. Supply chain disruptions due to natural hazards have been researched in key manufacturing-based economies like Thailand, the US, Japan, and China. Limited studies, however, have looked at the nature of interconnected risks and its effective countermeasures that arise when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt supply chains. Here, we examine systemic risks by contrasting supply chain disruptions caused by natural hazards and the pandemic. Our study investigates whether businesses can manage systemic risks brought on by the pandemic by learning from dealing with disruptions caused by natural hazards. We offer a typology of conversion strategies to demonstrate how conversion strategies can be a successful response to pandemic scenarios. Specifically, we propose six conversion types: production location, production line, storage, usage, distributional channel, and workforce skill set.

"Huyen, N.T.T.; Hong, Y.N.; Ha, L.T.",Could volatile cryptocurrency stimulate systemic risks in the energy sector evidence from novel connectedness models,"By identifying the connectedness of seven indicators from January 1, 2019, to June 13, 2022, we choose an extended joint connectedness approach to a vector autoregression model with time-varying parameter (TVP-VAR) to analyze interlinkages between Crypto Volatility (CV) and Energy Volatility (EV). Our findings show that the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have an impact on the dynamic connectedness of the whole system, which peaks at about 60% toward the end of 2019. According to net total directional connectedness over a quantile, throughout the 2020 2022 timeframe, natural gas and crude oil are net shock transmitters, while the CV, clean energy, solar energy, and green bonds consistently receive all other indicators. Specifically, pairwise connectedness indicates that the CV appears to be a net transmitter of shocks to all energy indicators before the COVID-19 outbreak but acts as a net receiver of shocks from clean energy, wind energy, and green bonds in late 2020. The CV mostly has spillover effects on green bonds. The primary net transmitter of shocks to the Crypto market is crude oil. Our findings are critical in helping investors and authorities design the most effective policies to lessen the vulnerabilities of these indicators and reduce the spread of risk or uncertainty. 2023 The Author(s).

There is an increased incidence and prevalence of the condition linked to location-specific obesity rates. There are no licensed treatments for the condition. The majority of approaches to managing the disease prioritize resolution of papilledema. However, evidence is emerging that idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a systemic metabolic disease. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to present the emerging pathophysiology evidence which is leading to novel targeted therapeutics. The diagnostic pathway is outlined. The current and potential management approaches for idiopathic intracranial hypertension are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a condition with metabolic dysregulation with systemic manifestations that are present over and above what can be expl.ained by obesity alone.

"Zhang, Q.; Ou, Y.; Chen, R.",Digitalization and stability in banking sector: a systemic risk perspective,"This paper analyzes the relationship between digitalization and systemic risk of commercial banks using data from listed commercial banks from 2010 to 2019. The findings show that the higher the level of digital awareness and the richer the digital products, the lower the systemic risk of banks the higher the complexity of banks’ digital organization, the higher the systemic risk of banks. The digital development of banks reduces systemic risk overall by optimizing the structure of banks’ deposits and loans, and optimizing the structure of banks' deposits and loans at other levels. The degree of impact of digitalization on the systemic risk of banks differs by their attributes, and regional commercial banks are more affected than large state-owned banks and joint-stock banks.

"Birge, J.R.; Capponi, A.; Chen, P.-C.",Disruption and rerouting in supply chain networks,"We study systemic risk in a supply chain network where firms are connected through purchase orders. Firms can be hit by cost or demand shocks, which can cause defaults. These shocks propagate through the supply chain network via input-output linkages between buyers and suppliers. Firms endogenously take contingency plans to mitigate the impact generated from disruptions. We show that, as long as firms have large initial equity buffers, network fragility is low if both buyer diversification and supplier diversification are low. We find that a single-sourcing strategy is beneficial for a firm only if the default probability of the firm’s supplier is low. Otherwise, a multiple-sourcing strategy is ex post more cost effective for a firm. 2022 INFORMS.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Operations Research,contingent rerouting; cost effectiveness; cost shocks; demand shocks; disruption risk; input-output; purchase orders; purchasing; sales; secondary market; secondary markets; sourcing strategies; supply chain network; supply chain networks; supply chains; systemic risk; systemic risks,,,"Birge, J.R.

"Zheng, Z.; He, J.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, M.; Wu, D.; Bian, Y.; Cao, J.",Does financial leverage volatility induce systemic financial risk empirical insight based on the chinese fintech sector,"Financial leverage volatility is a significant factor contributing to the formation of systemic financial risk, which is more apparent in China's fast-growing fintech (financial technology) field. Using the Conditional Value-at-risk approach (ΔCoVaR) risk metric, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (Structural Vector Autoregression with Stochastic Volatility model SV-TVP-SAVRmodel, and the generalized forecast error variance decomposition (Tvpdy) model, this paper discusses how financial leverage volatility shocks fintech sectoral risks and the evolution of the risk within fintech under the shocks on the basis of the classification criteria of the Chinese fintech enterprise database and daily trading data of A-share listed companies. The statistical show that financial leverage volatility causes risk changes across fintech sectors, which is especially significant during economic downturns or government interventions. Also, under the shock of financial leverage volatility, the fintech sectors will absorb or diffuse risks outward through spillover channels, with significant differences in the risk spillover conditions of different types of sectors. Finally, the fintech sector can produce a contagion system with the Internet consumer finance, payment, and Internet microcommercial credit sectors as the core of risks, resulting in a systemic risk crisis. Our findings have major implications for Chinese regulators to balance financial leverage and prevent systemic risks in the fintech sector. 2022 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Managerial and Decision Economics,,,,"Zheng, Z.

"Igan, D.; Mirzaei, A.; Moore, T.",Does macroprudential policy alleviate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the resilience of banks,"This paper examines the resilience of banks as perceived by market participants during the COVID-19 crisis. We analyse how bank stock returns during January March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default. 2022 The Author(s)",2023,2023-01-01,11,Journal of Banking and Finance,bank resilience; bank stock returns; covid-19; macroprudential policy,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment","Igan, D.

"Zhou, E.; Wang, X.",Dynamics of systemic risk in european gas and oil markets under the russia ukraine conflict: A quantile regression neural network approach,"The Russia Ukraine conflict (RUC) has triggered a serious natural gas (hereafter referred to as gas) and oil supply crisis in Europe. We propose a quantile regression neural network model to capture the non-linear evolution of systemic risk in the European gas and oil markets. We find that the RUC significantly increased systemic risk in both the European gas and the oil markets. The systemic risk is higher, and rises much more quickly and falls much more slowly in the gas market than in the oil market. The dynamics of systemic risk are closely linked to major events during the RUC. The US-dollar-to-ruble exchange rate contributes most to this systemic risk, followed by Europe's gas stocks and gas imports from Russia. In terms of risk exposure, the gas market is more vulnerable than the oil market. We propose an elasticity coefficient of systemic risk to evaluate its sensitivity to stress scenarios.

"Han, X.; Hsu, S.; Li, J.; An, R.","Economic policy uncertainty, non-financial enterprises' shadow banking activities and stock price crash risk","At present, the structural contradiction between Economic Financialization and the real economy's long-term weakness has become increasingly prominent. As China enters a new normal stage of economic growth, the real investment rate drops, non-financial enterprises continuously allocate resources to the shadow banking system. The financial economy becomes increasingly divorced from reality. This leads us to the questions: will the shadow banking behavior of non-financial companies exacerbate the risk of stock price crash risk How does the increase in economic policy uncertainty affect the relationship between non-financial companies' shadow banking activities and stock price crash risk This article uses non-financial listed companies' data from 2007 to 2017 and conducts empirical analysis to answer this question. The study finds that companies engaged in high-leverage, high-risk shadow banking business exacerbate stock crash risk. This effect is only pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and low social trust regions. The increase in the degree of economic policy uncertainty positively impacts the relationship between non-financial companies' shadow banking business and stock price crash risk. The theoretical mechanism is as follows: the rise in economic policy uncertainty amplifies the positive relationship between shadow banking activities of non-financial companies and stock price crashes by increasing bank loans, investors' sensitivity to external information, risk cross-contagion, and inefficient investment mechanisms. Various robustness tests do not change the research conclusion. This paper has important theoretical and policy guidance significance for reviewing the existing diversified shadow banking system and preventing systemic risks. 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Emerging Markets Review,economic policy uncertainty; non-financial enterprises' shadow banking activities; stock price crash risk,,,"Han, X.

"Kumar, P.; Singh, V.K.",Examining the time varying spillover dynamics of indian financial indictors from global and local economic uncertainty,"The research aims to excavate the role of global (Fed Rate, Crude, Real Dollar Index) and endogenous economic variables (GDP and Consumer Price Index) in shaping the spillover amongst the major Indian Financial indicators, viz. Nifty Index, MCX Gold, USDINR, Govt. Bond 10Y maturity and agricultural index N-Krishi. To facilitate cross-comparison decomposition of time-varying spillover output generated from Time-Varying Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) with aggregation at three layers is performed. The research finds that Indian Financial Indicators are vulnerable to spillover shocks from global variables predominantly driven by Fed Rate and Real Dollar Index. USDINR turns out to be most sensitive to global shocks and transgresses the shock to other financial indicators. Importantly, persistently high inflation has brought volatility spikes in the directional spillover to financial indicators. Though spillover subsidence is observed post-2014, with an all-time high during GFC, a sudden spurt in all financial indicators has been observed post-Covid-19, with Govt. bonds showing a sporadic rise. An important observation relates to staunch spillover from GDP during GFC with reoccurrence post-Covid. Additionally, a closely knit spillover tie is observed among USDINR, N-Krishi, and Crude. The study is beneficial to RBI to proactively monitor the weakening rupee along with Fed tapering to manage the rising spillover post-Covid-19.

"Giansante, S.; Manfredi, S.; Markose, S.",Fair immunization and network topology of complex financial ecosystems,"The aftermath of the recent financial crisis has shown how expensive and unfair the stabilization of financial ecosystems can be. The main cause is the level of complexity of financial interactions that poses a problem for regulators. We provide an analytical framework that decomposes complex ecosystems in both their overall level of instability and the contribution of institutions to instability. These ingredients are then used to study the pathways of the ecosystems towards stability by means of immunization schemes. The latter can be designed to penalize institutions proportionally to their contribution to instability, and therefore enhance fairness. We show that fair immunization schemes can also be cost-efficient when employed on ecosystems characterized by a tiered network structure of interactions concentrated among few core nodes that at the same time form many closed cycles that exacerbate instability. For less tiered network topologies we observe a trade-off between fairness and dollar-cost of immunization, allowing regulators to choose the combination that best meets their s. The implementation of immunization schemes on real cross-border financial networks of the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) reporting country banking systems is also provided. 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,1,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,banks; complex ecosystems; cost-efficient; dynamical systems; economic and social effects; ecosystems; finance; financial crisis; financial networks; immunization; is costs; network structures; network topology; risk analysis; risk assessment; stability analysis; stability analyze; systemic risk; systemic risks; tiered networks; topology,,,"Giansante, S.

The program was designed to help intelligence analysts make better probability judgments, which required posing rapidly resolvable questions. From a signal detection theory perspective, the superforecasting and Taleb et al. programs are complementary, not contradictory (a point Taleb and Tetlock (2013) recognized). The superforecasting program aims at achieving high hit rates at low cost in false-positives, whereas Taleb et al. prioritize alerting us to systemic risk, even if that entails a high false-positive rate. Proponents of each program should, however, acknowledge weaknesses in their cases. It is unclear: (a) how Taleb et al.

This research contribution is about applying a novel systemic risk index to the Romanian financial system (FRM RO), to identify potential sources of systemic risk, and to understand network interconnections, thus increasing risk awareness of both managers and regulators. By using data for companies listed at the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE), our article highlights several aspects of the systemic risk of the Romanian stock market. First, our study reveals that the main driver of systemic risk, especially during financial crises, is the volatility index, VIX. However, local factors, such as ROBOR interest rate and sectorial indices for financial investment companies, in general, and energy sector companies, in particular, are extremely important in triggering systemic risk. Second, the system risk indicator for the Romanian stock market, FRM RO, may capture both investor sentiment, measured via the Google Trends Search Volume Index, and stock market volatility. Third, FRM RO can act as an early warning indicator for economic turmoil, being able to predict periods of technical recession one quarter in advance. Fourth, by using network analysis, we can identify, daily, the level of market interconnectedness and highlight the main companies triggering tail co-movements.

We hypothesized that Marshallese households were experiencing high rates of food insecurity due to socioeconomic and systemic risk factors. Seventy-one Marshallese adults shared socioeconomic information about their household via an online survey. Descriptive indicate that 91% of respondents report food insecurity. In terms of systemic barriers, almost half of Marshallese respondents do not have health insurance. Additionally, while most respondents report feeling calm, peaceful, and energetic, paradoxically, 81% report feeling depressed and downhearted at least some of the time. Logistic regression findings suggest that food insecurity is significantly related to education levels and household economic strain. These are analogous with national findings, whereby non-native households are more likely to experience higher levels of food insecurity, lower rates of education, and higher economic strain than native households. As a collective community, the Marshallese could benefit from culturally responsive individual and family systems approaches for improving educational, social, financial, and health opportunities through workforce development, household income and asset development, and food security initiatives.

"Magner, N.S.; Hardy, N.; Lavin, J.; Ferreira, T.",Forecasting commodity market synchronization with commodity currencies: A network-based approach,"This paper shows that some commodity currencies (from Chile, Iceland, Norway, South Africa, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) predict the synchronization of metals and energy commodities. This relationship links the present-value theory for exchange rates and its connection with commodity export economies’ fundamentals, where prospective commodity price fluctuations affect exchange rates. Predicting commodity market return synchronization is critical for dealing with systemic risk, market efficiency, and financial stability since synchronization reduces the benefits of diversification and increases the probability of contagion in financial markets during economic and financial crises. Using network methods coupled with in-sample and out-of-sample econometrics models, we find evidence that a fall in the return of commodity-currencies (dollar appreciation) predicts an increase in commodity market synchronization and, consequently, in commodity market systemic risk. This discovery is consistent with a transitive capacity phenomenon, suggesting that commodity currencies have a predictive ability over commodities that extend beyond the commodity bundle that a country produces. The latter behavior would be exacerbated by the high financialization of commodities and strong co-movement of commodity markets. Our paper is part of a vigorously growing literature that has recently measured and predicted systemic risk caused by synchronization, combining a complex systems perspective and financial network analysis.",2023,2023-03-25,0,Entropy,,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Magner, N.S.

"Bordo, M.D.; Duca, J.V.",How the new fed municipal bond facility capped municipal-treasury yield spreads in the covid-19 recession,"For over two centuries, the municipal (muni) bond market has been a source of systemic risk, which returned early in the Covid-19 downturn when borrowing from securities markets became costly for many private and public entities, and some found it difficult to borrow at all. Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the muni market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent such a calamity, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment-grade state and local government bonds at ratings-based interest rate spreads over the safe OIS benchmark yield. In general, these spreads were initially about 100 basis points above average spreads under more normal market conditions and were later lowered by 50 basis points in August 2020. Despite a modest take-up, our study documents the MLF prevented muni spreads from rising much above those margins (plus a modest 10 basis point fee) and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There were concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could induce moral hazard among borrowers and could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility had lasted too long. Partly for this reason and because the muni market had settled down by yearend 2020, the Treasury terminated the MLF at that time. Future assessments of these downside aspects will help answer the question whether the program's benefits addressed here exceeded its costs. 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2023,2023-01-01,1,Journal of the Japanese and International Economies,central bank policy; credit policy; municipal finance; state and local governments,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Bordo, M.D. (Rutgers University, National Bureau of Economic Research, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, United States); Duca, J.V.

"Li, J.; Li, S.",Immunization of systemic risk in trade investment networks,"By constructing trade investment networks and modeling the contagion of systemic risk in trade and investment channels within different countries, we design three immune strategies, namely, Random Immune, Target Immune, and Neighbor Immune, and compare the inhibitory effect of these strategies on the shock contagion of multilayer networks. Using bilateral trade and portfolio investment data between China and OECD countries from 2003 to 2019, show that first, independent of the source of contagion, the network system with a self-healing capability always reaches the steady state after a certain period of the risk transmission process. The investment network is more resilient to systemic risk than the trade network. Second, Random Immune is inferior in intervening on important countries and currently provides weaker protection for trade investment networks than two other types of immunization strategies because of the high concentration of trade and investment events in the networks. Third, Target Immune aiming at controlling the most important country, the US, is not optimized for improving risk resistance of countries cooperating scarcely with the US, but its optimization efficiency continues to increase as the significance of the US in the system keeps rising. Fourth, among the four Neighbor Immune approaches, Asset-Neighbor Immune provides the superior and consistently enhanced protection for the trade investment networks, and Liability-Neighbor Immune has the dominant position in terms of the enhancement for risk resistance of each country's trade and investment channels. Investment Asset-Neighbor Immune or Investment Liability-Neighbor Immune, which effectively reduces the negative impact of systemic risk on the whole system and all countries, is proposed to be implemented in trade investment networks. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,bilateral trade; china (country); commerce; efficiency; enhancement efficiency; immune strategies; immune strategy; immunization; inhibitory effect; investments; multi-layer network; portfolio investment; resilience enhancement efficiency; systemic risk; systemic risks; trade–investment network; trade–investment networks,,,"Li, J.

"Hoque, H.; Liu, H.",Impact of bank regulation on risk of islamic and conventional banks,"We analyse the impact of bank regulation on the risks of Islamic banks (IBs) and conventional banks (CBs) between 2004 and 2015 by employing 455 CBs and 95 IBs from 22 countries where IBs and CBs coexist. Since the of Basel regulations is to achieve a stable banking sector by mitigating risks, we examine the impact of bank regulations on various risks of IBs and CBs by using a regression framework. We examine solvency risk, credit risk, idiosyncratic risk and systemic risk by using capital oversight, restriction on activities, private monitoring and supervisory power bank regulation data provided by the World Bank. The findings show that though the Basel regulations were originally developed for CBs, our imply that they are effective for IBs as well as CBs. However, our study also shows that regulations affect IBs and CBs differently as their business models are different. More targeted regulations towards IBs would be necessary to support IBs. Additionally, in regions with higher economic freedom indexes, banking regulations can mitigate the risk of IBs and CBs to a greater extent. Our imply that the combination of free economic policies and banking supervision addresses risks in banking effectively. Finally, the bank regulations did not appear to be able to control the risk of the sample banks during the 2007 2009 crisis. Hence, the Basel committee needs to rethink about regulations during crisis times. 2021 The Authors.

"Yan, X.; Zhang, S.; Hu, J.; Weng, W.; Wang, L.",Key points-in-time identification of gold futures market: A complex network approach,"Important nodes can determine the internal structure of complex networks and reveal the internal relationships of real-world systems, and identifying key nodes in complex networks is one of the important research areas of complex network science. As the king of commodities, changes in the price of gold significantly impact the economic development of various countries. Especially in the early stages of the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, the price of gold futures has been greatly impacted, and the systemic risks are gradually spreading. In this paper, a gold future price series is mapped into a visibility graph (VG), the characteristics of the gold price time series and key points-in-Time, have been explored from the perspective of complex network. First, according to the data structure characteristics of gold futures, this paper converts the closing prices of gold futures of the New York Mercantile Exchange into a complex network through the VG model. Then, by using the complex network model to further delve into the price of gold futures, it is found that the degree distribution of the gold futures network follows a power-law distribution, and has obvious scale-free characteristics. Finally, this paper uses the visual network node shrinking algorithm and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) analysis method to identify the key nodes of the gold futures visual map to find the key time nodes in the timeline of gold futures market. Analysis of the key time nodes of this market by four methods reveals that the repetition rate of the key time nodes in the methods' top 10 ranking is as high as 82.5%, indicating that the obtained in this paper are robust. This study introduces a new model to describe the characteristics of gold futures price series, one which can find key time nodes in gold futures prices and provide potential help for predicting gold futures prices. 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Fluctuation and Noise Letters,gold futures; network node shrinking algorithm; topsis; visibility graph,,,"Yan, X.

"Singh, S.S.; van, d.T.J.E.; Sijbrands, E.J.G.; de, R.Y.B.; Kavousi, M.; Bos, D.",Lipoprotein(a) is associated with a larger systemic burden of arterial calcification,"AIMS: Lipoprotein(a) Lp(a) is a genetically determined risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, population-based evidence on the link between Lp(a) and subclinical arteriosclerosis is lacking. We assessed associations of Lp(a) concentrations with arteriosclerosis in multiple arteries. METHODS ANDFrom the population-based Rotterdam study, 2354 participants (mean age: 69.5 years, 52.3% women) underwent non-contrast computed tomography to assess arterial calcification as a hallmark of arteriosclerosis. We quantified the volume of coronary artery calcification (CAC), aortic arch calcification (AAC), extracranial (ECAC), and intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC). All participants underwent blood sampling, from which plasma Lp(a) concentrations were derived. The association of plasma Lp(a) levels was assessed with calcification volumes and with severe calcification (upper quartile of calcification volume) using sex-stratified multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Higher Lp(a) levels were associated with larger ln-transformed volumes of CAC fully adjusted beta 95% confidence interval (CI) perstandard deviation (SD) in women: 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.14, men: 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.14AAC (women: 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.11, men: 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.14), ECAC (women: 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.13, men: 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.14), and ICAC (women: 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.14, men: 0.05, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.11In the highest Lp(a) percentile, severe ICAC was most prevalent in women fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.41, 95% CI 1.25-4.63 and severe AAC in men (fully adjusted OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.67-6.49). CONCLUSION: Higher Lp(a) was consistently associated with a larger calcification burden in all major arteries. The findings of this study indicate that Lp(a) is a systemic risk factor for arteriosclerosis and thus potentially an effective target for treatment. Lp(a)-reducing therapies may reduce the burden from arteriosclerotic events throughout the arterial system. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: In 2354 participants from the Rotterdam study, we assessed the link between Lp(a) concentrations and arterial calcifications, as proxy for arteriosclerosis, in major arteries. We found that higher Lp(a) levels were consistently associated with larger volumes of calcification in the coronary arteries, aortic arch, extracranial carotid arteries, and intracranial carotid arteries. The findings of our study indicate that Lp(a) is a systemic risk factor for arteriosclerosis, suggesting that the systemic burden of arteriosclerosis throughout the arterial system could be reduced by targeting Lp(a).",2023,2023-04-21,0,European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging,,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Singh, S.S.

"Natsagdorj, N.",Macroprudential policy to manage systemic risk deriving from financial institutions in mongolia,"This study presents a measurement model of systemic risk in the frontier market that fully employs financial statement data. The Financial Times Stock Exchange survey notes that frontier markets exist in more than 150 countries. The sum of systemic risk in the frontier markets can hinder economic stability in terms of a herd of risk. Frontier markets are likely to imply unpredicted systemic risk if we think based on previous lessons learned from being unable to foresee the early signals of the Lehman Brothers shock. The reasons for the rarely studied systemic risk in these markets might be that the markets are systemically unimportant, and there is a lack of publicly available data access. Therefore,gave it my best shot to capture systemic risk in the frontier market entirely using financial statement data. It is sometimes said that the frontier market is systemically not important because of its small size however, the research argued that the interconnection between financial institutions is highly likely to raise systemic risk even if it is small. The fact is the majority of financial institutions in developed, emerging, and frontier markets are deeply interconnected with each other via a network. For instance, the financial market in Mongolia is representative of frontier markets. As a financial regulatory aspect, financial conglomerates are increasing and deepening their interconnection in bank-dominated and underdeveloped capital markets. Hence, the intuition is to capture the systemic uncertainty behind increasing conspiracies in financial conglomerates to negatively impact financial stability. To accomplish this, the methodology measures financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk can be computed by the systemic expected shortfall. The systemic expected shortfall would be dependent on the marginal expected shortfall and can be explained by financial leverage and liabilities as the predicting power increases. Moreover, financial statements are situational mirrors of financial institutions. Based on these assumptions, we empirically measured the time and cross-dimensions of systemic risk using financial statement data. Potential variables from financial statements were tested to identify variables that could forecast systemic risk. Stock returns and capital market data have been frequently experimented with in previous literature, and financial statement data of frontier markets are new for systemic risk measurement. As a result of the analysis, the systemic expected shortfall could explain cross-dimension systemic risk, which is financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Subsequently, the time series of the marginal expected shortfall can forecast the amount of systemic risk in the next two periods. Eventually, macroprudential policy, a policy tool for systemic risk, can be easily developed after forecasting financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk.",2023,2023-02-12,0,New Frontiers in Regional Science: Asian Perspectives,,Business; Capital market; Economics; Emerging markets; Finance; Financial crisis; Financial economics; Financial market; Financial risk; Financial system; Frontier; Law; Macroeconomics; Political science; Systemic risk,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Natsagdorj, N.

"Meng, S.; Chen, Y.","Market volatility spillover, network diffusion, and financial systemic risk management: financial modeling and empirical study","With the accelerated pace of financial globalization and the gradual increase in linkages among financial markets, correctly identifying and describing the risk spillover and network diffusion in the financial system is extremely important for the prevention and management of systemic risk. Based on this, this paper takes the equity markets of 17 countries around the world from 2007 to 2022 as the research object, measures the volatility spillover effect of global financial markets using R-Vine Copula and the DY spillover index, constructs the volatility spillover network of global financial markets, discovers the spillover and diffusion pattern of global financial market risks, and provides relevant suggestions for systemic risk management. It is found that (1) there are certain aggregation characteristics in the network diffusion of global financial market volatility spillover (2) developed European countries such as the Netherlands, France, the UK, and Germany are at the center of the network and have a strong influence (3) Asian countries such as China, Japan, and India are at the periphery of the network and (4) shocks from crisis events enhance the global financial market volatility spillover effect. Based on the above findings, effective prevention of global financial market risk volatility spillover and network diffusion and reduction in systemic risk need to be carried out in two ways. First, by focusing on the financial markets of key countries in the network, such as the Netherlands, the UK, France, and Germany. The second approach is to mitigate the uneven development in global financial markets and reduce the high correlation among them. 2023 by the authors.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Mathematics,global financial markets; network diffusion; systemic risk management; volatility spillovers,,,"Meng, S.

We prove that the value of the central agent’s control problem converges as the number of defaultable institutions goes to infinity, and that it satisfies a drift controlled version of the supercooled Stefan problem. We compute optimal strategies in feedback form by solving numerically a regularized version of the corresponding mean field control problem using a policy gradient method.

This systemic risk can be mitigated by adjusting the loans, holding shares, and other liabilities connecting institutions in a way that prevents cascading of failures. We are approaching the systemic risk problem by attempting to optimize the connections between the institutions. In order to provide a more realistic simulation environment, we have incorporated nonlinear discontinuous losses in the value of the banks. To address scalability challenges, we have developed a two-stage algorithm where the networks are partitioned into modules of highly interconnected banks and then the modules are individually optimized. We developed a new algorithms for classical and quantum partitioning for directed and weighed graphs (first stage) and a new methodology for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems with constraints for the systemic risk context (second stage).

"Eggleton, S.; Gürses, Ö.",Reinsuring pandemics: the role of government and public private partnerships between reinsurers and governments,"Pandemic-related business interruption (BI) losses are generally considered uninsurable’ because, in order to pool sufficient premium revenue to meet valid claims, premiums would be unaffordable for the majority of policyholders. This paper explores whether and how such losses might be made insurable in the U.K. The authors consider post-pandemic governmental responses, including the role of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the meaning and implications of FCAArch Insurance (U.K.) Ltd2021 UKSC 1). The central premise of the paper is to highlight the importance of reinsurance in increasing an underwriter’s insuring capacity and to illustrate how, with the support of government in the form of a public private partnership (PPP), uninsurable’ risks of this type may be made insurable. The authors propose a PPP, Pandemic Business Interruption Re’, which provides, in their view, a feasible and defensible solution that would confer the benefit of increasing policyholders' faith in the industry's ability to underwrite pandemic-related BI claims and reduce reliance on ex post government aid.",2023,2023-02-17,0,the Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance - Issues and Practice,,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","Eggleton, S.

Consequently, this study seeks to analyze the investment opportunities in the medical sector before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, the Markowitz mean variance (MV) model, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and correlation models are constructed based on the principle of Markowitz MV and correlation analysis. Simultaneously, statistical analysis is used to verify the analysis, and the MATLAB statistical tool is used to build the model. The show that the actual expected yield of China’s medical sector is significantly higher than that calculated by the CAPM before and after the pandemic, and that the investment value of the medical sector is undervalued by the market. From the perspective of risk, China’s medical sector has a stable systemic risk premium.

The pandemic has formed a colossal disruption in supply chain networks. It has caused piling higher mortality in patients with comorbidities and generated a surging demand for critical care equipment, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and cutting-edge technologies. Personal protective equipment, masks, ventilators, testing kits, and even commodities required for daily care have been scarce as lockdown and social distancing guidelines have kicked in. Amidst COVID-19, implementing and executing key processes of the healthcare supply chain (HSC) in a secured, trusted, effective, universally manageable, and the traceable way is perplexing owing to the fragile nature of the HSC, which is susceptible to redundant efforts and systemic risks that can lead to adverse impacts on consumer health and safety. Though the crisis shone a harsh light on the cracks and weaknesses of the HSC, it brings some significant insights into how HSC can be made more resilient and how healthcare industries figure out solutions to mitigate disruptions. While there are innumerable experiences learned from the disruption of this crisis, in this paper, five important areas to analyze the most vital and immediate HSC enhancements including building a resilient supply chain, thinking localization, implementing reliable reverse logistics, breaking down extant silos to achieve end-to-end visibility, and redesigning HSC using digitalization are emphasized. This work identifies important features related to CoT and HSC. Also, this study links these lessons to a potential solution through Chain of Things (CoT) technology. CoT technology provides a better way to monitor HSC products by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain networks. However, such an integrated solution should not only focus on the required features and aspects but also on the correlation among different features. The major of this study is to reveal the influence path of CoT on smart HSC development. Hence, this study exploits (i) fuzzy set theory to eliminate redundant and unrelated features (ii) the Decision-Making and Experimental Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to handle the intricate correlation among different features. This fuzzy-DEMATEL (F-DEMATEL) model attempts to direct CoT technology towards smart HSC by identifying the most influencing factors and investors are recommended to contribute to the development of application systems. This work also demonstrates how CoT can act a vital role in handling the HSC issues triggered by the pandemic now and in the post-COVID-19 world. Also, this work proposes different CoT design patterns for increasing opportunities in the HSC network and applied them as imperative solutions for major challenges related to traditional HSC networks.",2023,2023-01-13,0,Socio-economic Planning Sciences,,,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,"Sathiya, V.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling residents using a validated self-assessment as part of comprehensive health screening. Methods: The data were derived from comprehensive health screening (PORI75) for older adults of 75 years living in Western Finland in 2020 and 2021. One of 30 validated measures in health screening focused on identifying medication-related risk factors (LOTTA Checklist). The Checklist items were divided into (1) systemic risk factors (10 items) and (2) potentially drug-induced symptoms (10 items). Polypharmacy was categorized according to the number of used drugs: (1) no polypharmacy (5 drugs, that is, having polypharmacy. Of the systemic risk factors most common was that the resident had more than one physician responsible for the treatment (48% of the residents), followed by missing drug list (43%), missing regular monitoring (35%), and unclear durations of the medication (35%). The most experienced potentially drug-induced symptoms were self-reported constipation (21%), urinating problems (20%), and unusual tiredness (17%). An increasing number of drugs in use, particularly excessive polypharmacy, was associated with various medication-related risk factors. Conclusion: As a part of comprehensive health screening the LOTTA Checklist provides useful information to prevent medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling older adults. The Checklist could be used to guide planning and implementing health services in the future. 2023 The Authors.

We argue that digital massification phenomena largely escape societal awareness due to their protracted evolution and are therefore still in the blind spot of long-term governance. Our analysis makes methodological use of historical and relational analogy, and we introduce and elaborate concepts and terms that allow us to discuss the evolutionary nature of massification, that is, the foreseeable increasing probability of the occurrence of trigger events. Using the analogy to the history of road traffic congestion, we deduce that digital massification will most likely lead to a future ""risk transition"" where tolerated disturbances and inconveniences of the present will turn into systemic impacts.

The onset of a systemic crisis is triggered by a large exogenous shock to banks’ balance sheets. Their behavioural response is modelled by a cascade mechanism that tracks the propagation of damaging shocks and possible amplification of the crisis, and leads the system to a cascade equilibrium. The mathematical properties of the stochastic framework are investigated for the first time in a generalization of the Eisenberg Noe solvency cascade mechanism that accounts for fractional bankruptcy charges. New include verification of a tree independent cascade property of the solvency cascade mechanism, and culminate in an explicit recursive stochastic solvency cascade mapping conjectured to hold in the limit as the number of banksgoes to infinity. It is shown how this cascade mapping can be computed numerically, leading to a rich picture of the systemic crisis as it evolves toward the cascade equilibrium.",2023,2023-01-10,0,Mathematics and Financial Economics,,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Hurd, T.R.

We find a complementary effect between internal corporate governance mechanisms in reducing both the contribution and the exposure to systemic risk, and a substitution effect between internal and external governance practices in constraining the exposure of NFCs to systemic risk.

This paper discusses the policy improvement for preventing systemic risk from the perspective of the clustering pattern of systemically important banks (SIBs) based on a network optimization model. The show that the clustering pattern of SIBs is closely related to systemic risk contagion. Remarkably, networks with fewer connections among SIBs exhibit lower systemic risk than those featuring apparent clustering of SIBs. The potential mechanism is that the systemic vulnerability of small and medium-sized banks is greatly reduced in the disassortative networks. The proposed tools based on this-inter-SIBs exposure limits and pairwise capital requirements-can guide network optimization and significantly reduce systemic risk. Furthermore, combining existing capital surcharges for SIBs (focusing on the stability of individual SIBs) and proposed network-based tools (focusing on the cluster structure of the network) will be an effective way to enhance financial stability over existing policies.",2023,2023-04-27,0,Plos One,cluster analysis,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","Zhu, B.

"Narayan, S.; Kumar, D.",Systemic risk transmission from the united states to asian economies during the COVID-19 period,"The study investigates the systemic risk transmission from the US banking sector and the US market to the five most economically impacted Asian nations (Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, India, and Singapore) during the COVID-19 period of 2020. We consider the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) approach to estimate the systemic risk of the given economies at 5% quantile (for severe downturn risk) and 20% quantile (for moderate downturn risk). Our findings demonstrate a rise in systemic risk for these Asian countries in 2020, particularly in the first half of the year. The findings also provide evidence of the significant systemic risk transmission from the US banking sector and the US stock market to the majority of the given Asian economies at both quantiles. The study further highlights the significant contribution of the US financial market in increasing the systemic risk of the given Asian economies in 2020. We find similar for systemic risk transmission from the UK, the European Union, and Japan to the given Asian economies. The findings have implications for market participants, risk managers, and regulators who are concerned with risk diversification and tracking the routes of risk shock transmission.

"Li, Y.; Wu, K.; Chen, Z.; Xu, G.; Wang, D.; Wang, J.; Bulloch, G.; Borchert, G.; Fan, H.",The association between retinal microvasculature derived from optical coherence tomography angiography and systemic factors in typediabetics,"Aims: To investigate the correlation between the retinal microvasculature using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and systemic factors in typediabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study obtained OCTA data from patients with T2DM administered at hospital and referred to ophthalmic services. Patient data about demographics, comorbid conditions, and blood biomarkers were extracted from electronic medical records. Data from OCTA scans obtained by CIRRUS HD-OCT Model 5,000 were obtained. Vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) within the superficial capillary plexus, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were automatically segmented. These parameters were tested for their correlations with systemic factors by univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses.A total of 144 T2DM patients (236 eyes) were available for analysis, with mean age of 53.6 (SD 10.34) and 56.9% were male. Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, increased serum creatinine (Scr), red blood cell count (RBC), platelets (PLT), apolipoprotein(APOB), and decreased urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) were significantly associated with lower VD and PD (all0.013). UACR and triglyceride (TRIG) were significantly correlated with FAZ area (all0.017). In multivariate analyses, PLT, eGFR, and APOB were independent risk factors for retinal rarefaction, and UACR was a significant predictor of FAZ area. Conclusion: We found several systemic risk factors, such as PLT, renal function and lipid profiles were associated with PD, VD, and FAZ area among Chinese T2DM patients.

"Nguema, B.A.; Alagidede, I.P.; Odei-Mensah, J.",The impact of derivatives use on systemic risk of africa’s banking system,"This paper contributes to the debate about Africa’s financial stability by focusing on the prevalence of systemic risk in 40 listed derivatives user-banks over 2011 2017, employing the systemic risk index (SRI), and subsequently exploring how it links to the continent’s financial market development. The systemic risk buildup within the industry is mainly depicted as an unstable, diluted, and possibly depleting process. Gloomy predictions persist in the subsequent attempts to uncover plausible causes of systemic risk formation. Mainly, conventional defining factors for risk exhibit irrelevance toward systemic risk development, as threats to financial stability remain confined within the industry, supported by a lack of diversification in financial services. The investigated markets may be individually subject to internal vulnerabilities that could be exacerbated by financial shocks, feedback effects, and the likelihood of contagion and failure among financial institutions. 2023 Taylor Francis Group, LLC.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Journal of African Business,african banking market; derivatives use; systemic risk contribution; systemic risk index; systemic risk sensitivity,,,"Nguema Bekale, A.

"Nistor, S.; Ongena, S.",The impact of policy interventions on systemic risk across banks,"What is the impact of policy interventions on the systemic risk of banks To answer this question, we analyze a comprehensive sample that combines an original set of bank-specific bailout events with the balance sheets of key affected and nonaffected European banks between 2005 and 2014. We find a positive and significant association of guarantees with systemic risk that is somewhat weaker in the long run when the regulator appoints members to the supervisory board. The short run association between recapitalizations and systemic risk is also positive for large and less capitalized banks, while in the long run, recapitalizations are linked with reduced systemic importance, especially for less profitable banks and in cases when the regulator limits management pay. Liquidity injections are positively linked with systemic risk, but the long-run effect is mitigated for small or better capitalized banks. In the short run, injecting liquidity is associated with reduced systemic risk when the regulator imposes restrictions on supervisory board composition or on management pay or capital payouts. 2023, The Author(s).",2023,2023-01-01,0,Journal of Financial Services Research,policy interventions; regulatory restrictions; risk strategies; systemic risk,Bailout; Balance sheet; Business; Expected shortfall; Market liquidity; Monetary economics; Recapitalization; Sample (statistics); Short run; Systemic risk,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment","Nistor, S.

Moreover, two nonparametric methods are utilized, the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and the bootstrap Kolmogorov Smirnov test, in order to investigate the changes in individual effects and the dominant ranks of sectoral systemic risk. The empirical show that (1) the mean values and volatilities of CES and MES of all sectors have a higher level of magnitude in the extreme risk status than those in the normal risk status (2) by comparing the total effects of three crisis events, we find that different from the continuous shock effect caused by two other events, sectoral systemic risk has a hysteresis effect on the entire market after the outbreak of COVID-19 (3) the long-term and short-term individual effects of sectoral systemic risk in all sectors are different from each other during three events and (4) the dominance tests of MES are more sensitive and thus better demonstrate the changes in the rankings of sectoral systemic risk than the dominant tests of CES during the emergency crisis events.",2023,2023-03-12,0,Systems,,Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Econometrics; Shock (circulatory); Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Economics; Panel data; Medicine; Macroeconomics; Economic growth; Internal medicine; Curriculum,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11030147,,biblio,,195-467-484-694-767,

This disease affects both men and women, but there are certain differences in the development and progression of the disease in different sexes.Aim: To study associations of polymorphic loci of candidate genes with the risk of developing knee in the male population of the Central Chernozem region of Russia.Material and Methods. The study sample included 410 men (208 patients with knee OA and 202 controls). Ten polymorphic loci of candidate genes were genotyped: rs2820436 and rs2820443 LYPLAL1, rs3771501 TGFA, rs11177 GNL3, rs6976 GLT8D1, rs1060105 and rs56116847 SBNO1, rs6499244 NFAT5, rs34195470 WWP2, rs143384 GDF5. The study of associations of polymorphic genetic loci with the development of the disease was carried out by the method of logistic regression, taking into account covariates (age, BMI). The MB-MDR method was used to study intergenic interactions of polymorphisms associated with the disease. and Discussion. It was found that nine out of ten polymorphic loci of candidate genes (with the exception of rs6976 GLT8D1) are associated with the formation of knee OA in men in four models of interlocus interactions (pperm 0.024).

"Alaminos, D.; Salas, M.B.","Tourism stock prices, systemic risk and tourism growth: A kalman filter with prior update DSGE-VAR model","Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models allow for probabilistic estimations to formulate macroeconomic policies and monitor them. One of theof creating these models is to explain and understand financial fluctuations through a consistent theoretical framework. In the tourism sector, stock price and systemic risk are key financial variables in the international transmission of business cycles. Advances in Bayesian theory are providing an increasing range of tools that researchers can employ to estimate and evaluate DSGE and VAR models. One area of interest in previous literature has been to design a Bayesian robust filter, that performs well concerning an uncertainty class of possible models compatible with prior knowledge. In this study, we propose to apply the Bayesian Kalman Filter with Prior Update (BKPU) in a tourism field to increase the robustness of DSGE and VAR models built for small samples and with irregular data. Our indicate that BKPU improves the estimation of these models in two aspects. Firstly, the accuracy levels of the computing of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo model are increased, and secondly, the cost of the resources used is reduced due to the need for a shorter run time. Our model can play an essential role in the monetary policy process, as central bankers could use it to investigate the relative importance of different macroeconomic shocks and the effects of tourism stock prices and achieve a countryinternational competitiveness and trade balance for this sector. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),bayesian; bayesian kalman filter; computation theory; costs; dynamic stochastic general equilibrium; economics; general equilibrium; kalman filters; markov chain monte carlo; markov chain monte-carlo; markov processes; monte carlo methods; prior update; stochastic models; stochastic systems; stochastics; stock price; systemic risk; systemic risks; tourism stock price; tourism stock prices; tourism stocks; value engineering; volatility,,,"Alaminos, D.
