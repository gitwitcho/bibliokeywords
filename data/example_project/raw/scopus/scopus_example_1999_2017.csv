The ocular and systemic risk factors were also reviewed. Methods: Data were obtained retrospectively from patients with massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage who were treated in Worthing and Southlands National Health Service Trust between January 2003 and December 2008. Results: The study included 10 patients (5 women and 5 men) with a mean age of 73.9 years (range, 54-84 years). All patients underwent early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 100% perfluoropropane as a tamponade. The mean interval of drainage from the onset was 3.5 days (range, 1-10 days). Anatomical restoration of ocular structures was achieved in 7 patients, with good final visual outcome at mean 9 months (range, 6-14 months). The remaining three patients had poor visual outcome because of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The most common risk factor in this case series was glaucoma, which was seen in five patients. Arteriosclerosis was the only risk factor in two patients. Conclusion: Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with 100% perfluoropropane tamponade may help in achieving a good visual outcome. The use of 100% perfluoropropane has the advantage of maintaining positive pressure while facilitating controlled drainage of the hemorrhage as the clot lyses. Retinal detachment however is a poor prognostic indicator.

This is required because the banking sector has been transformed significantly by the changing environment over the past two decades. The 2007-2009 financial crisis also added to concerns about existing bank business models. Design/methodology/approach: Using qualitative data collected from interviews with bank managers and analysts in the UK, this paper develops a grounded theory of bank intangibles. Findings: The model reveals how intangibles and tangible/financial resources interact in the bank value creation process, how they actively respond to environmental changes, how bank intangibles are understood by external observers such as analysts, and how bankers and analysts differ in their views. Research limitations/implications: Grounded theory provides the means to further develop bank models as business models and theoretical models. This provides the means to think beyond conventional finance constructs and to relate bank models to a wider theoretical literature concerning intellectual capital, organisational and social systems theory, and ""performativity"". Practical implications: Such development of bank models and of a systems perspective is critical to the understanding of banks by bankers, by observers and for their ""critical and reflexive performativity"". It also has implications for systemic risk and bank regulation. Originality/value: The paper reveals the core role of intellectual capital (IC) in banks, in markets, and in developing theory and research at firm and system levels. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bank models; Banks; External observers; Intermediation; Knowledge; Systems; United Kingdom,,"Holland, J.; Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; email: john.holland@glasgow.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,09513574,,,,English,Account.

The currently preferred policy option is the regulation of capital requirements, with the main focus on combating procyclicality and on identifying the banks that have a high systemic importance, those that are ""too big to fail"". Here we argue that the concept of systemic risk should include the analysis of the system as a whole and we explore systematically the most important properties for policy purposes of networks topology on resistance to shocks. In a thorough study going from analytical models to empirical data, we show two sharp transitions from safe to risky regimes: 1) diversification becomes harmful with just a small fraction (∼2%) of the shocks sampled from a fat tailed shock distributions and 2) when large shocks are present a critical link density exists where an effective giant cluster forms and most firms become vulnerable. This threshold depends on the network topology, especially on modularity. Firm size heterogeneity has important but diverse effects that are heavily dependent on shock characteristics. Similarly, degree heterogeneity increases vulnerability only when shocks are directed at the most connected firms. Furthermore, by studying the structure of the core of the transnational corporation network from real data, we show that its stability could be clearly increased by removing some of the links with highest centrality betweeness. Our results provide a novel insight and arguments for policy makers to focus surveillance on the connections between firms, in addition to capital requirements directed at the nodes. © 2013 Loepfe et al.

Variability of carotid bifurcation anatomy is a possible explanation. Flow models suggest that vessel anatomy, in particular vessel diameter and area ratios, affects plaque formation at arterial bifurcations. However, carotid bifurcation anatomy could only be a major risk factor for plaque formation if it was sufficiently variable. Since very few data exist on the extent of interindividual and intraindividual variability of bifurcation anatomy, we studied 5395 angiograms from the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Methods - To minimize changes in bifurcation anatomy secondary to atherosclerosis, we excluded vessels with ≥30% stenosis. We measured arterial diameters at disease-free points and calculated the following ratios: internal to common carotid (ICA/CCA), external to common carotid (ECA/CCA), external to internal carotid (ECA/ICA), and outflow/ inflow area. For intraindividual asymmetry, we compared the ratios on both sides. Results - Each ratio varied markedly between individuals. The 95% ranges were as follows: ICA/CCA, 0.44 to 0.86; ECA/CCA, 0.34 to 0.80; ECA/ICA, 0.55 to 1.33; and outflow/inflow area, 0.38 to 1.28. The results were very similar in 407 bifurcations with no disease. Among the 755 patients with <30% stenosis bilaterally, side differences of ≥25% were present in 17% (95% CI, 15% to 20%) for the ICA/CCA ratio, 27% (95% CI, 24% to 30%) for the ECA/CCA ratio, 32% (95% CI, 28% to 35%) for the ECA/ICA ratio, and 42% (95% CI, 38% to 45%) for the outflow/inflow area ratio. Conclusions - We found large interindividual differences in carotid bifurcation anatomy. For example, there was 4-fold variation of the ratio of outflow to inflow area. Intraindividual variation was also considerable. These data highlight the potential importance of anatomic variation as a risk factor for atheroma and provide a firm basis for flow modeling studies.",Angiography; Carotid arteries; Risk factors; Stroke,"article; atherosclerotic plaque; brain blood flow; carotid arteriography; carotid artery bifurcation; common carotid artery; external carotid artery; human; internal carotid artery; priority journal; risk factor; carotid artery; carotid artery disease; histology; radiography; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Human; Risk Factors; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Rothwell, P.M.; Stroke Prevention Research Unit, Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6HE, United Kingdom; email: peter.rothwell@clneuro.ox.ac.uk",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,00392499,,SJCCA,11692011.0,English,Stroke,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035164324,scopus

According to the updated numbers on epidemiology a further increase of persons affected is expected. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is estimated to be 9–16 % in type 2 diabetes and 24–27 % in type 1 diabetes. A prolongation of the screening interval from 1 to 2 years is recommended for those patients with a lower risk of progression, when retinopathy has not already occurred and no increased systemic risk factors are present. Standardized documentation forms are the foundation for improved communication between the disciplines. If diabetic retinopathy is present, control examinations follow the stipulations of the ophthalmologist. The guidelines define scenarios when the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) is necessary, e. g. diagnosis and follow-up of macular edema. Besides focal and panretinal laser therapy, the efficacy and risks of intravitreal operative pharmacotherapy are discussed. Focal laser coagulation is recommended for therapy of macular edema without foveal involvement and for macular edema with foveal involvement patients should be informed about the effective alternative forms of treatment. Panretinal laser coagulation is recommended for first line treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and is optional for severe non-proliferative retinopathy. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Control examinations; Diabetes; Evidence-based medicine; Macular edema; Screening,diabetic retinopathy; evidence based medicine; follow up; Germany; human; practice guideline; Diabetic Retinopathy; Evidence-Based Medicine; Follow-Up Studies; Germany; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic,"Ziemssen, F.; Department für Augenheilkunde, Schleichstr. 12, Germany; email: focke.ziemssen@med.uni-tuebingen.de",,Springer Verlag,2731720X,,OHTHE,27352282.0,German,Ophthalmologe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976435973,scopus

We investigate the phenomenon of abrupt breakdown of an electric power-system under two scenarios: load growth (mimicking the ever-increasing customer demand) and power fluctuations (mimicking the effects of renewable sources). Our results on real, realistic and synthetic networks indicate that increasing the system size causes breakdowns to become more abrupt; in fact, mapping the system to a solvable statistical-physics model indicates the occurrence of a first order transition in the large size limit.

According to this ""global"" view reserve accumulation might destabilize the international financial system. Since the crisis affects all countries alike, the accumulation of reserves imposes a negative externality on non-accumulating countries. We integrate this idea in a theoretical model of the optimal amount of reserves and illustrate the gap between local and global optimality: the consideration of systemic risk lowers the demand for reserves. Moreover, if a supranational authority determines the optimal level of reserves, it internalizes the negative externality and accumulates fewer reserves. A macroprudential tax on reserve hoardings might implement the socially optimal solution. Our calibration analysis shows that these considerations are economically significant: they lower the optimal amount of reserves in the benchmark case by 45%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Financial crises; Global imbalances; International reserves; Macro-prudential policies; Systemic risk,,"Steiner, A.; University of Osnabrueck, Institute of Empirical Economic Research, Rolandstrasse 8, D-49069 Osnabrueck, Germany; email: asteiner@uni-osnabrueck.de",,Elsevier,00142921,,,,English,Eur.

Therefore, DES design, materials, and coatings have been technologically revolutionized. Herein, we designed a novel abluminal groove-filled biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (AGF-BP-SES), with a sirolimus content of only about one-third of traditional DES. The mechanical performances of AGF-BP-SES during compression and expansion were investigated. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sirolimus was studied in the swine model. The in vivo efficacy of AGF-BP-SES was compared with that of Xience PRIME® stent. The results showed that AGF-BP-SES exhibited mechanical properties similar to traditional DES, including the rebound ratio of radial contraction/direction, rebound ratio of axial contraction/direction, and inhomogeneity of compression/expansion. Despite utilizing a reduced dose of sirolimus, AGF-BP-SES delivered sirolimus to the coronary artery in a controlled and efficient manner. The stent maintained a safe and effective local drug concentration without local or systemic risks. In the swine model, histopathological indicators predicted safety and biocompatibility of AGF-BP-SES. In conclusion, AGF-BP-SES maintained similar mechanical properties as other stents while reducing the drug-loading capacity, and showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile of the targeted DES.

Much of this reform was in direct response to the weaknesses revealed in the pre-crisis system. The new “macroprudential” approach to financial regulations focuses on risks arising in financial markets broadly as well as the potential impact on the financial system that may arise from financial distress at systemically important financial institutions. Systemic risk is the key factor in financial stability, but our current understanding of systemic risk is rather limited. While the goal of using regulation to maintain financial stability is clear, it is not obvious how to design an effective regulatory framework that achieves the financial stability objective while also promoting financial innovations. This article discusses academic research and expert opinions on this vital subject of financial stability and regulatory reforms. Specifically, among other issues, it discusses the impact of increasing public disclosure of supervisory information, effectiveness of bank stress testing as a tool to enhance financial stability, whether the financial crisis was caused by TBTF, and whether the DFA resolution regime would be effective in achieving financial stability and ending TBTF. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Financial regulations; Financial stability; Mortgage finance; Resolution plan; Stress testing; Systemic risk; Too big to fail,,"Jagtiani, J.; Federal Reserve Bank of PhiladelphiaUnited States; email: Julapa.Jagtiani@phil.frb.org",,Springer New York LLC,09208550,,,,English,J.

However, the disagreement between the various candidate models increases significantly during market distress, further frustrating the reliability of risk readings.

These events inspired the SYRTO project to “think and rethink” the economic and financial system and to conceive it as an “ensemble” of Sovereigns and Banks with other Financial Intermediaries and Corporations. Systemic Risk Tomography: Signals, Measurement and Transmission Channels proposes a novel way to explore the financial system by sectioning each part of it and analyzing all relevant inter-relationships. The financial system is inspected as a biological entity to identify the main risk signals and to provide the correct measures of prevention and intervention. © 2017 ISTE Press Ltd Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,,,Elsevier,,9781785480850,,,English,"Systemic Risk Tomography: Signals, Measurement and Transmission Channels",Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124924564,scopus

Donor age accepted range is from 1 to 50 years of age, but this can be extended at both ends of the spectrum (from 6 months of age up to 55 to 60-years old) when the donor characteristics are excellent or when the recipient condition is relatively urgent. The selection of donors and the search for fewer risk factors are key when reduction or split techniques are used, since the process of dividing organs is in itself an added risk (trauma and possible prolongation of ischemia). An 'optimal' donor is defined based on age, hemodynamic characteristics and systemic risk factors. In pediatric donors, preference is given to the 'no-touch' technique and aortic-only perfusion for procuring organs from the donor, particularly when the donor is not hemodinamically stable.

From 2008 to 2012, 420 patients (448 eyes) with exudative AMD were prospectively registered at Seoul National University Hospital. From this group of patients,125 eyes were included in this study. All patients were treated with 3 consecutive IVRinjections. The visual acuity (VA) was evaluated at baseline and 1 month after the thirdranibizumab injection. To evaluate the risk factors associated with VA improvement afterIVR, patient demographic data and systemic risk factors were analyzed. Patients were divided into a poorVA improvement group and a good VA improvement group, withreference to the median visual improvement in all eyes.

Material/Methods: One hundred and eighty volunteers (69 male, 111 female) who were categorized as systemically healthy control, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obese and menopause were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic characteristics and oral health behaviors were recorded via questionnaire. Clinical periodontal parameters, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), sulcus bleeding index (SBI) and decayed, missing, and filled teeth index (DMFT), were assessed. Systemic parameters and LXA4 levels were evaluated in serum samples. Results: Clinical periodontal parameters and DMFT were higher in subjects with achieved systemic risk factors than in healthy subjects. The systemically healthy with periodontitis group had higher serum LXA4 levels than the systemically healthy with non-periodontitis group (P&lt;0.05). The Ne/Ly ratio was higher in the hyperlipidemic group with periodontitis than in the hyperlipidemic group with non-periodontitis (P&lt;0.05). In the control group, serum LXA4 levels were positively correlated with the PD, CAL and SBI. Conclusions: In the presence of periodontitis, an increase in LXA4 levels and the Ne/Ly ratio in hyperlipidemic patients could contribute to the hypothesis that these parameters could be an indicator in periodontitis and its systemic risk factors. © Med Sci Monit.",Chronic periodontitis; Lipoxins; Lymphocytes; Neutrophils; Risk factors,alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; calcifediol; calcium; creatinine; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoxin A; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; biological marker; lipoxin; lipoxin A; adult; aged; Article; blood analysis; clinical attachment level; controlled study; cross-sectional study; decayed missing and filled teeth index; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gingiva disease; health; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; periodontal pocket; periodontics; periodontitis; questionnaire; risk factor; sulcus bleeding index; tooth plaque; urea nitrogen blood level; young adult; blood; case control study; leukocyte count; lymphocyte; lymphocyte count; neutrophil; periodontitis; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Lipoxins; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophils; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; Young Adult,"Doğan, B.; Department of Periodontology, Turkey; email: burakdogann@gmail.com",,International Scientific Literature Inc.,12341010,,MSMOF,26298769.0,English,Med.

However, the identification of G-SIBs may overlook banks with major domestic systemic importance, i.e. the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). This paper describes how to adjust market-based systemic risk measures to identify D-SIBs. In an empirical analysis within the eurozone, I show that (i) the SRISK methodology produces similar rankings whatever the system used. However, (ii) the SRISK values greatly vary across systems, which calls for imposing the higher of either D-SIB or G-SIB HLA requirements. Finally, (iii) the δCoVaR methodology is extremely sensitive to the choice of the system. © 2013 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy.",D-SIBs; Financial regulation; G-SIBs; SRISK; Systemic risk,,"Benoit, S.; Univ.

By combining customer transactions and credit bureau data from January 2005 to April 2009 for a sample of a major commercial bank's customers, we are able to construct out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R2's of forecasted/realized delinquencies of 85%. Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses. Moreover, the time-series patterns of estimated delinquency rates from this model over the course of the recent financial crisis suggest that aggregated consumer credit-risk analytics may have important applications in forecasting systemic risk. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Consumer credit risk; Credit card borrowing; Household behavior; Machine learning; Nonparametric estimation,,"Lo, A.W.; MIT Sloan School of Management and Laboratory for Financial EngineeringUnited States; email: alo@mit.edu",,,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

METHODS: Setting: Institutional.STUDY POPULATION: The study includes 594 consecutive patients (829 eyes) with a diagnosis of NA-AION and follow-up of at least two months after the onset of NA-AION, examined in the Ocular Vascular Clinic since 1973. Simple progression of visual loss during an episode of NA-AION was not considered a fresh episode. INTERVENTION OR OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Every patient had ophthalmic evaluation, including visual acuity, visual fields with a Goldmann perimeter, intraocular pressure, and slit lamp and ophthalmoscopic evaluation at initial visit and at each follow-up visit. The patients also had systemic evaluation; some patients had echocardiography (166 patients) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring-the latter was investigated in 80 patients (17 with and 63 without recurrence of NA-AION) who consented to participate in this study which was started in 1989. While optic disk edema was present, the patients were followed every 2 to 3 weeks. Once the optic disk edema resolved, they were followed up after 3 months, 6 months, and then at yearly intervals unless they had some new visual complaint. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of a fresh episode of NA-AION in the same eye, and comparison of ocular and systemic risk factors between patients with and without recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye.RESULTS: Of the 594 patients (829 eyes) in the study, recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye occurred in 45 patients (53 eyes) with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range 2 months to 30.5 years) from the first onset of NA-AION. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed cumulative percentage of recurrence of NA-AION from first episode to second episode at three months 1.0%±0.4%(SE), at 6 months 2.7%±0.7%, at one year 4.1%±0.9%, and 2 years 5.8%±1.1%. There was no significant association between recurrence of NA-AION and the systemic conditions that were examined, except for nocturnal arterial hypotension. Overall patients with a recurrence of NA-AION had a significantly lower mean nighttime minimum diastolic BP (P = .003) and greater mean percentage drop during sleep in diastolic BP (P = .011) than those with no recurrence of NA-AION; all other measures of nocturnal hypotension were not significantly predictive.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye is uncommon (6.4%). Our study indicates that nocturnal diastolic arterial hypotension may be a risk factor; however, since this is a multifactorial disease, other so far unknown risk factors may also play a role. The role of various risk factors which may contribute to the recurrence of NA-AION is discussed.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relationship between visual function, as measured by a patient's binocular integrated visual field and visual acuity (VA), general health and the risks of falling and injurious falls. Results: Among the 365 subjects, 55 subjects experienced falls in the past year. A significant difference was observed in worse-eye VA between the faller and non-faller groups (p = 0.03). SEM of fallers obtained a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.035 and a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of 0.99. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of regression coefficients from this model suggested better VA and worse VA were significant risk factors for falling. Among the 55 fallers, 22 subjects experienced an associated injury. There was a significant difference in gender between the non-injurious and injurious faller groups (p = 0.002). SEM of injurious fallers obtained a RMSEA of 0.074 and a CFI of 0.97. In this SEM model, the 95% CI of regression coefficients suggested gender and average total deviation values in the lower peripheral visual field were significant risk factors for an injurious fall. Conclusions: This study suggests that worse-eye and better-eye VAs are associated with falls. Furthermore, patients with inferior visual field loss and females were found to be at greater risk of injurious falls. © 2015 Yuki et al.

Financial firms are said to be TBTF when policy makers judge that their failure would cause unacceptable disruptions to the overall financial system, and they can be TBTF because of their size or interconnectedness. In addition to fairness issues, economic theory suggests that expectations that a firm will not be allowed to fail create moral hazard-if the creditors and counterparties of a TBTF firm believe that the government will protect them from losses, they have less incentive to monitor the firm's riskiness because they are shielded from the negative consequences of those risks. If so, they could have a funding advantage compared with other banks, which some call an implicit subsidy. There are a number of policy approaches-some complementary, some conflicting-to coping with the TBTF problem, including providing government assistance to prevent TBTF firms from failing or systemic risk from spreading; enforcing “market discipline” to ensure that investors, creditors, and counterparties curb excessive risk-taking at TBTF firms; enhancing regulation to hold TBTF firms to stricter prudential standards than other financial firms; curbing firms' size and scope, by preventing mergers or compelling firms to divest assets, for example; minimizing spillover effects by limiting counterparty exposure; and instituting a special resolution regime for failing systemically important firms. A comprehensive policy is likely to incorporate more than one approach, as some approaches are aimed at preventing failures and some at containing fallout when a failure occurs. Parts of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act; P.L. 111-203) address all of these policy approaches. For example, it created an enhanced prudential regulatory regime administered by the Federal Reserve for non-bank financial firms designated as “systemically important” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and banks with more than $50 billion in assets. About 30 U.S. bank holding companies and a larger number of foreign banks have more than $50 billion in assets, and the FSOC has designated three insurers (AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial) and GE Capital as systemically important. A handful of the largest banks face additional capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a special resolution regime administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take into receivership failing firms that pose a threat to financial stability. This regime has not been used to date, and has some similarities to how the FDIC resolves failing banks. Statutory authority used to prevent financial firms from failing during the crisis has either expired or been narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The fact that most large firms have grown in dollar terms since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act has led some critics to question whether the TBTF problem has been solved. In the 114th Congress, S. 1484 would increase the $50 billion asset threshold to $500 billion for enhanced regulation under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act. Banks with assets between $50 billion and $500 billion would be subject to a designation process by FSOC. Compared with the current non-bank designation process, S. 1484 would require FSOC to provide more information to (bank or non-bank) institutions and give them more opportunities to take actions to avoid or reverse systemically important financial institution (SIFI) designation. It would also increase public disclosure requirements surrounding the designation process.

Better tools to identify indolent tumors are needed to avoid overtreatment. OBJECTIVE To determine if a multigene classifier is associated with indolent behavior of invasive breast cancers in women followed for 2 decades. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen vs no systemic therapy, with more than 20-year follow-up. An indolent threshold (ultralow risk) of the US Food and Drug Administration–cleared MammaPrint 70-gene expression score was established above which no breast cancer deaths occurred after 15 years in the absence of systemic therapy. Immunohistochemical markers (n = 727 women) and Agilent microarrays, for MammaPrint risk scoring (n = 652 women), were performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor blocks. Participants were postmenopausal women with clinically detected node-negative breast cancers treated with mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation enrolled in the Stockholm tamoxifen (STO-3) trial, 1976 to 1990. EXPOSURES After 2 years of tamoxifen vs no systemic therapy, regardless of hormone receptor status, patients without relapse who reconsented were further randomized to 3 additional years or none. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Breast cancer–specific survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling, adjusted for treatment, patient age, year of diagnosis, tumor size, grade, hormone receptors, and ERBB2/HER2 and Ki67 status. RESULTS In this secondary analysis of node-negative postmenopausal women, conducted in the era before mammography screening, among the 652 women with MammaPrint scoring available (median age, 62.8 years of age), 377 (58%) and 275 (42%) were MammaPrint low and high risk, respectively, while 98 (15%) were ultralow risk. At 20 years, women with 70-gene high and low tumors but not ultralow tumors had a significantly higher risk of disease-specific death compared with ultralow-risk patients by Cox analysis (hazard ratios, 4.73 [95% CI, 1.38-16.22] and 4.54 [95% CI, 1.40-14.80], respectively). There were no deaths in the ultralow-risk tamoxifen-treated arm at 15 years, and these patients had a 20-year disease-specific survival rate of 97%, whereas for untreated patients the survival rate was 94%. Recursive partitioning identified ultralow risk as the most significant predictor of good outcome. In tumors “not ultralow risk,” tumor size greater than 2 cm was the most predictive of outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ultralow-risk threshold of the 70-gene MammaPrint assay can identify patients whose long-term systemic risk of death from breast cancer after surgery alone is exceedingly low. © 2017 American Medical Association.

Financialization refers to both the rising political and economic power of financial service firms and the growing importance of financial, rather than production, strategies in the rest of the economy. In the US case at least, financialization also accompanied a shift from values associated with employment and production to a normative elevation of financial investment. In the US the financialization dimension of neoliberalism has increased national and global systemic risk, increased income inequality between sectors of the economy, capital and labor and among classes of workers, and at the same time has led to decreased employment and a less productive economy. The lesson is that, despite the surface attractiveness of globalized finance, financialization is a particular dangerous dimension of neoliberal politics and policy.",Financialization; Inequalities; Neoliberalism,,"Tomaskovic-Devey, D.; University of MassachusettsUnited States",,"Ljubljana University, Faculty of Social Sciences",00403598,,,,English,Teor.

The contagion is described by a new way of disease propagation perspective based on the concept of a financial virus. The model reproduces the existence of TBTF banks and shows the impact that an initial TBTF bank crash produces in the interbank network depending on the magnitude of the initial crash and on the resistance that the network offers against the contagion propagation. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.,Complex networks; contagion; interbank network; systemic risk,,"Tirado, M.; Departamento de Física Fundamental, C/Senda del Rey 9, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; email: mtirado33@alumno.uned.es",,,01291831,,,,English,Int.

This document aims to analyse the circumstances that have brought about this radical change. We will first explore the period between 1997 and 2007, characterised by sustained credit growth and the formation of a real-estate bubble of unprecedented proportions in the Spanish economy. We will then focus on two main aspects related to the banking regulatory framework: the implementation of dynamic provisions by the national bank supervisory authority (Banco de España) designed to cope with expected losses rooted in procyclical bank lending behaviour and the role played by the implementation of the Basel II framework with respect to credit risk. This paper detects important deficiencies in the regulatory framework and supervisory process and concludes that these have been one of the main causes of the Spanish savings banks debacle. © The Author 2015.

Friedman, MD, MPH, PhD CONTEXT Over the past decade, chronic illnesses with ophthalmic sequelae such as diabetes and diabetic retinopathy have increased. OBJECTIVES To estimate prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment and to describe its relationship with demographic and systemic risk factors including diagnosed diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized population. In 1999-2002 and 2005-2008, 9471 and 10 480 participants aged 20 years or older received questionnaires, laboratory tests, and physical examinations. Visual acuity of less than 20/40 aided by autorefractor was classified as nonrefractive visual impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Nonrefractive visual impairment. RESULTSWeighted prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment increased 21% among US adults aged 20 years and older from 1.4%in 1999-2002 to 1.7%in 2005-2008 (P = .03); and increased 40% among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.5%to 0.7%(P = .008). In multivariable analyses, statistically significant risk factors for nonrefractive visual impairment in 1999-2002 included age (per year odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95%CI, 1.05-1.09), poverty (OR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.31-3.64), lack of insurance (OR, 1.85; 95%CI, 1.16-2.95), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.15-3.25). In 2005-2008, risk factors included age (OR, 1.05; 95%CI, 1.04-1.07), poverty (OR, 2.23; 95%CI, 1.55-3.22), education less than high school (OR, 2.11; 95%CI, 1.54-2.90), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 2.67; 95%CI, 1.64-4.37). Prevalence of diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis increased 22%overall from 2.8%to 3.6% (P = .02); and 133%among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.3%to 0.7%(P < .001). CONCLUSION Prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment was significantly higher in 2005-2008 than in 1999-2002 and may be attributable, in part, to higher prevalence of diabetes, an associated risk factor that increased in prevalence during this time period.",,adult; article; diabetic retinopathy; female; health insurance; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; poverty; priority journal; race difference; risk factor; visual acuity; visual impairment; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; Male; Vision Disorders,"Klein, R.; Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, 610 n Walnut St, Madison, WI 53726, United States; email: kleinr@epi.ophth.wisc.edu",,,21686165,,,24015401.0,English,JAMA Ophthalmol.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880252249,scopus

Since the GFC, Deutsche Bank and several other SIBs have been made to pay over US$200 billion in fines and remediation costs for misconduct in a number of areas, beyond misselling of mortgages, such as manipulation of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and foreign exchange (FX) benchmarks; misselling of insurance products (such as payment protection insurance); sanctions busting; money laundering; and other misconduct. This paper points out that these events are the result of a failure to manage operational risks, both at the level of the firm and across the banking system. Although research into individual and group behavioral biases has increased, less research has been conducted into misbehavior at the level of the banking system, that is, misconduct which occurs in multiple financial institutions, seemingly independently, at the same time. By comparing the Libor and FX benchmark manipulation scandals, this paper describes how misbehavior emerged independently in both of these markets and the conditions that permitted the misconduct to survive and thrive.

Although they are distinct from one another, the atherosclerotic and thrombotic processes appear to be interdependent and may be integrated under the term ""atherothrombosis."" It is now clear that plaque composition, rather than the percent stenosis, is a major determinant of plaque vulnerability. Plaque disruption seems to depend on both passive and active phenomena and is not purely mechanical. Inflammation (activation of monocytes/macrophages) is a major determinant of both plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity as they relate to plaque disruption. In one-third of acute coronary syndromes, there is, however, no plaque disruption but only superficial erosion of a markedly stenotic, fibrotic plaque. In these cases, thrombus formation may be exacerbated by a hyperthrombogenic state present in patients with certain systemic risk factors. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis and hemostasis. This dynamic organ regulates blood thrombogenicity as well as contractile, secretory, and mitogenic activities in the vessel wall. Some classic risk factors induce endothelial dysfunction by reducing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, increasing tissue endothelin-1, and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Vascular hemostasis, which is the maintenance of blood fluidity and vascular integrity, is achieved by counter-balancing the intrinsic clotting tendency of blood. As a consequence of the central role of endothelial cells in hemostatic control, a dysfunctional endothelium will generate a pro-thrombotic environment favoring development of atherosclerotic lesions and thrombotic complications. © 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,endothelin 1; nitric oxide; acute heart infarction; artery endothelium; atherogenesis; atherosclerotic plaque; bioavailability; blood clotting; blood flow; blood vessel wall; cardiovascular system; cell activation; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery obstruction; coronary artery thrombosis; coronary risk; disease exacerbation; fibrosis; hemostasis; homeostasis; human; inflammation; macrophage; mitogenesis; monocyte; pathogenesis; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; review; secretion; signal transduction; thrombogenesis; thrombogenicity; thrombus; tissue level; vasoconstriction,"Fuster, V.; Mount Sinai School of Medicine, , New York, NY 10029, United States; email: valentin.fuster@mssm.edu",,Elsevier Inc.,07351097,,JACCD,12644335.0,English,J.

We studied retrospectively the clinical presentation, laboratory test, imaging techniques, therapeutic interventions, and outcome of adult IS diagnosed in POVISA hospital between January 1978 and December 2005. Seventy-six cases of IS (48 male and 28 female) were identified, 29 tuberculous (TS) and 47 non tuberculous (NTS). The age at the time of the diagnosis was 47.1 ± 17.5 (mean ± SD). TS were the most frequent IS between 1978 ad 1991. All patients suffered inflammatory pain in the involved spinal segment, and 41% of them also presenting neurological signs. NTS were associated with a high frequency of fever (64% vs. 47.4%; p < 0.05) and leucocytosis (57.4% vs. 6.9%; p < 0.0001). Active extra-vertebral tuberculosis was found in 14 (48%) cases of TS. Systemic risk factors were identified in 25% of patients and a portal of entry was presumed in 28 (59.6%) NTS: surgical spinal procedures (11), cutaneous infections (5), vascular catheter infections (3), intravenous drug abuse (3), ginecological surgery (2), urinary infections (2), pneumonia (1) and pyorrhea (1). Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen, comprising 31 (66%) of the 47 NTS, follows by Streptoccocus spp. (6) and coagulasa negative Staphylococcus (3). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus were the remaining causative agents. Only 8% of infectious spondylodicitis involved the cervical spine. Epidural abscess were diagnosed in eight (8,5%) patients. TS was associated with greater diagnosis delay (22.5 ± 16 vs. 5.1 ± 3.1 weeks, p < 0.001), and more residual spinal kyphosis and/or scoliosis (65% vs. 17%, p < 0.002). Unfortunately, delay from onset to diagnosis of IS continues to be excessive, and exceeded to four months in the NTS. This fact is associated with more residual spinal deformity. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of IS in any patient that presents with spinal inflammatory pain, fever and/or increased of acute phase reactants.",Adults; Infectious spondylodiscitis; Postsurgical spondylodiscitis; Tuberculosis; Vertebral osteomielitis,Brucella abortus; catheter infection; diagnostic imaging; drug abuse; Escherichia coli; fever; gynecologic surgery; human; infection; intervertebral disk degeneration; intravascular catheter; Klebsiella pneumoniae; laboratory test; leukocytosis; osteomyelitis; outcome assessment; pneumonia; Proteus mirabilis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; review; risk factor; Salmonella typhi; skin infection; spinal pain; Staphylococcus aureus; tuberculous spondylitis; urinary tract infection,"Gómez Rodriguez, N.; Unidad de Reumatología, 36201, Vigo, Spain",,,16678982,,,,Spanish,Salud Ci.,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749524823,scopus

In this paper, we propose a solution to effectively reduce the credit and systemic risk inherent to this portfolio - the proposed model can be applied to other mortgage portfolios in trouble as well. The main element of our proposal is income-contingent repayment complemented with effective incentives to motivate debtors to repay their debt. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is attractive for both the debtors and the lenders; therefore, contrary to some recent policy measures, in this case there is no need for direct state intervention to force modifications to the existing legal contracts. In order to evaluate the possible effects, we simulated a realistic population of borrowers with different age, debt, loan-to-value, and income. Then we calculated the expected income paths, the repayments of the borrowers as well as the profit of the lenders on the basis of the non-performing FX mortgage portfolio. The results underpin that the proposed scheme creates significant value added and, most importantly, that it can effectively reduce the vulnerability of the entire economy to future shocks. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",Emerging markets; FX mortgage loans; Hungary; Income-contingent repayment; Management of credit and systemic risk; Micro-simulation; PTI,credit provision; currency; debt; economic impact; financial market; incentive; income; mortgage lending; Hungary,"Berlinger, E.; Department of Finance, Hungary; email: Edina.Berlinger@uni-corvinus.hu",,Akademiai Kiado Rt.,00016373,,,,English,Acta Oecon.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954413031,scopus

Flow of funds across borders demands the security, integrity of the payment system and the harmonization of the systems in the related countries. The paper dwells with the need to modernize the payment system and migrate from paper-based to electronic mode of payment system to enhance efficiency and save cost. It delves in to the core of payment systems in the select countries with a comparative analysis. Benchmarking against the BIS core principles of Systemically Important Payment Systems revised as core principles of Financial Markets Infrastructure has been done to ensure convergence with the international best standards for Governance of Payment systems. The payment system of any country, though advanced and sophisticated, does face various risks, viz. bank failures, frauds, counter-party failures, etc. Such aberrations could trigger a chain-reaction that might ultimately result in disruption and distrust of the payment system. For example, if one large payment transaction cannot be settled, it disturbs other transactions leading to failure of the institutions involved in the process ultimately upsetting the entire payment system in the country. Such systematic and cascading breakdown of the payment system can hinder efficacy of monetary policy and badly impact confidence in the financial system. Minimization of systemic risk is therefore a critical challenge facing the regulators. Like in any ambitious economy, in India too, the fast advances in information technology, changes in regulatory framework, setting up of new institutions have aided to the rise of new payment practices, products and delivery channels for small as well as large value, and urgent payments. The paper shows areas for improvement in the efficiency in existing payment systems in India and the other countries especially in regard to the liquidity risk, operational risks, access criterion, transparency etc. In the end, the paper makes a modest attempt to identify opportunities and challenges for India. Numerous major changes in the payment system would take place at a quicker pace as e-commerce becomes more prevalent in the economic activities in the country. © Deepankar Roy, 2016.",Developed economies; Efficiency; India; Payment systems; Payment systems regulation,,,,ARRAY Development (Canada) Inc.,12045357,,,,English,J.

It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed ‘Systemic Risk Tax’ (SRT) leads to a self-organized restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and SR. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Agent-based modelling; Banking regulation; DebtRank; Financial transactions taxes; Network optimization; Resilience; Self-organization; Sustainability; Systemic risk,,"Thurner, S.; Section for Science of Complex Systems, Spitalgasse 23, Austria; email: stefan.thurner@meduniwien.ac.at",,Routledge,14697688,,,,English,Quant.

We construct a banking system that is composed of a number of banks, which are connected by interbank linkages. By examining the key structure parameters of the banking network, including degree (the number of connections of a bank) and link weight (the amount of interbank assets), we analyze the effect of these parameters on the stability of the banking system. We show that interbank linkages have two opposing effects. They can act as ""liquidity transmitters"" to transfer liquidity from solvent banks to insolvent banks through interbank connections. However, interbank linkages can also act as ""risk transmitters""; if one bank declares bankruptcy, then the loss can be transmitted to its connected banks. We investigate two environments that are differentiated by whether there is an aggregate shortage of liquidity.

METHODS: We recruited 27 patients with NAION and 27 age-matched and sex-matched controls who also were similar for systemic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. All patients and controls underwent overnight polysomnography for the diagnosis of OSAS and calculation of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). RESULTS: Patients and controls were statistically similar in terms of age, sex, gender, smoking, systemic risk factors, neck circumference, and body mass index. The subjects with AHI ≥ 20 were accepted as OSAS. Fifteen of 27 patients (55.6%) with NAION and 6 of 27 controls (22.2%) had OSAS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of OSAS was higher in patients with NAION, and the difference between patient and control groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

This paper aims to explore the potential risk contagion rules and characteristics. Firstly, interbank debt network is modeled with Chinese banking data. And the revised payment algorithm is applied in the simulation experiments. Secondly, three types of networks and four situations are constructed to simulate the interbank debt network. The experiments aim to research the individual and mixed impacts of interbank loan ratio, capital adequacy ratio and etc on interbank risk contagion. The results show that 1) if interbank loan ratio exceeds 5%, the risk contagion will be triggered. Reducing the interbank loan ration can reduce the chance of interbank risk contagion. 2) a higher level capital ratio can effectively prevent interbank risk contagion. The best capital ratio is 6% to 8%. 3) from the perspective of network structure, average degree of network graph has an obvious effect on risk contagion.

The present paper focuses on measuring financial cycle length for a series of developed as well as emerging economies by applying Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) techniques, which have the ability to decompose time series on a wide range of frequencies and identify statistically significant cyclical behavior. Using credit-to-GDP data collected by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for 13 countries, our results confirm the established hypothesis that financial cycles are significantly longer than business cycles, in the case of developed economies, underpinning the European framework for setting the countercyclical buffer rates. Using Wavelet Coherence measures, we find statistically significant co-movement in time-frequency between several EU members, as well as tighter relationships between euro area members. The main conclusion is that policymakers from emerging economies should monitor financial cycle dynamics more closely, using the additional assumption of shorter cycles, in order to identify the build-up of systemic risk through excessive credit growth in a timely manner. © 2017, Institute for Economic Forecasting.

Using non-parametric methods of estimating changes in the dependence structure in response to common shocks affecting individual risk profiles, possible linkages during periods of stress are quantifiable while recognizing that large shocks are transmitted across financial markets differently than small shocks. Before and during the initial phase of the financial crisis, we find that systemic risk increased globally as early as February 2007 - months before the unraveling of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The average (multivariate) dependence among a global sample of banks and insurance companies increased by almost 30% while joint tail risk declined by about the same order of magnitude, indicating that co-movements of large changes in equity volatility were more likely to occur and responses to extreme shocks became more differentiated as distress escalated. The key policy consideration flowing from our analysis is that complementary measures of joint tail risk at high data frequency are essential to the robust measurement of systemic risk, which could enhance market-based early warning mechanisms as part of macroprudential surveillance. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Co-movement; Correlation; Dependence; Early warning; Entropy; Extreme value theory; Financial contagion; Generalized extreme value; Macroprudential surveillance; Systemic risk,,"Jobst, A.A.; Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), 43 Victoria Street, Hamilton, HM 12, Bermuda; email: ajobst@bma.bm",,,10575219,,,,English,Int.

But these latter measures have many advantages, so the need is to devise other counter-cyclical macroprudential policies. This fragility was further enhanced by a decline in bank liquidity (reliance on wholesale funding) and a shift in govenance from partnerships to limited liability public companies. Some commentators have seen the solution to such pro-cyclicality in the guise of direct constraints on bank activity, such as the promotion of 'narrow banking' or limits on bank size. While there are arguments for toughening regulation as systemic risk increases, direct constraints are simplistic; more sensible ideas involve the adoption of better designed macro-prudential regulation, perhaps with some version of banking self-insurance.

Among the concerns raised was that a negative shock to insurers could lead to a fire sale of corporate bonds, a market where insurers are among the largest participants. This manuscript discusses the existing evidence on life insurance firms and systemic risk, with a focus on the investment-grade corporate bond market. We provide some tentative evidence that life insurers tend to absorb liquidity risk by purchasing bonds when the bonds are less liquid than average. However, we do not find evidence that insurers increased bond purchases specifically during the financial crisis, leaving open the question of whether insurers would play a stabilizing role in a future crisis.

It has sharply increased reserves to the banking system through open market operations and lowered the federal funds rate and discount rate on several occasions. Since December 2008, it has allowed the federal funds rate to fall close to zero. As the crisis deepened, the Fed's focus shifted to providing liquidity directly to the financial system through new policy tools. Through new credit facilities, the Fed first expanded the scale of its lending to the banking system and then extended direct lending to non-bank financial firms. The latter marked the first time since the Great Depression that firms that are not banks or members of the Federal Reserve System have been allowed to borrow directly from the Fed. After the crisis worsened in September 2008, the Fed began providing credit directly to markets for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. All of these emergency facilities had expired by the end of June 2010, but central bank liquidity swap lines were reopened in May 2010 in response to the crisis in Greece. The Fed also provided emergency assistance to Bear Stearns, AIG, and Citigroup over the course of the crisis; the Fed still holds assets from and loans to AIG and assets from Bear Stearns. These programs resulted in an increase in the Fed's balance sheet of $1.4 trillion at its peak in December 2008, staying relatively steady since then. The Fed's authority and capacity to lend is bound only by fears of the inflationary consequences, which have been partly offset by additional debt issuance by the Treasury. High inflation has not materialized yet because most of the liquidity created by the Fed is being held by banks as excess reserves, but after the economy stabilizes, the Fed may have to scale back its balance sheet rapidly to avoid it. Asset sales could be disruptive, but the Fed has argued that it can contain inflationary pressures through the payment of interest on bank reserves, which it was authorized by Congress to do in 2008. The statutory authority for most of the Fed's recent actions is based on a clause in the Federal Reserve Act to be used in ""unusual or exigent circumstances."" All loans are backed by collateral that reduces the risk of losses. Any losses borne by the Fed from its loans or asset purchases would reduce the income it remits to the Treasury, making the effect on the federal budget similar to if the loans were made directly by Treasury. It is highly unlikely that losses would exceed its other income and capital, and require revenues to be transferred to the Fed from the Treasury. To date, the Fed's crisis activities have increased its net income. Two policy issues raised by the Fed's actions are issues of systemic risk and moral hazard. Moral hazard refers to the phenomenon where actors take on more risk because they are protected. The Fed's involvement in stabilizing Bear Stearns, AIG, and Citigroup stemmed from the fear of systemic risk (that the financial system as a whole would cease to function) if they were allowed to fail. In other words, the firms were seen as ""too big (or too interconnected) to fail."" The Fed regulates member banks to mitigate the moral hazard that stems from access to government protections. Yet Bear Stearns and AIG were not under the Fed's regulatory oversight because they were not member banks. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern that certain details of the Fed's lending activities are kept confidential. H.R. 4173 adds conditions to the Fed's emergency lending authority, removes most GAO audit restrictions, and requires disclosure of the identities of borrowers with a delay. It also changes the Fed's role in the financial regulatory system. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Labonte, M.",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781621005827,,,English,Financ.

In the process, a clear difference is made between financial fragility, bubble, and fraud. The goal is to capture the growing interdependence between debt and asset price on the upside. The index is able to capture the rapid growth of financial fragility in residential housing from the early 2000s and an usually high level of financial fragility from 2004 in the United States. However, the construction of the index reveals that the data available are of limited quantity and quality for the purpose at hand. If the Financial Stability Oversight Council is serious about measuring systemic risk, better data about cash flows and loan underwriting should be collected in order to get an idea of the quality of leverage. This quality is measured by focusing on the means used to service debts instead of ability and willingness to service debt per se (i.e. credit risk). © 2014 M.E.

The rapid growth of the derivatives market, the potential for widespread credit defaults (such as defaults for subprime mortgages), and operational problems in the over-the-counter (OTC) market where credit default swaps are traded, have led some policymakers to inquire if credit default swaps are a danger to the financial system and the economy. For example, the establishment of a conservatorship for the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in September 2008 potentially triggered credit default swap contracts with notional value exceeding $1.2 trillion.

This task can be fulfilled by developing an adequate systems analysis methodology where the gas industry is seen as a complex graph decomposed into separate subsystems for further investigation. Formulation of gas industry sustainable development strategy aimed at finding and validating the optimum balance between gas production and consumption and ensuring harmonious and synchronous development of the industry subsystems, cannot be completed without a relevant methodology. While developing the methodology, it is critical to apply geo-information systems, in which by synthesizing various data, can display the entire information on the long-term gas industry development programs. To estimate cost-effectiveness of gas industry sustainable development strategy fundamental principles are applied. They include modeling of cash flows associated with implementation of different projects and the need to consider fluctuations in the field of development costs and results generated in different periods of time using discounted cash flows. Since systemic risks management is a multi-stage iterative process with a corresponding risks analysis as its core component risks should be assessed and managed in consistency with multiple scenarios of the gas industry development.

Our results comprise highly significant drivers of systemic risk in the European banking sector and have important implications for bank regulation.

This fluid drag force acting on the vessel wall is mechanotransduced into a biochemical signal that results in changes in vascular behavior. Maintenance of a physiologic, laminar shear stress is known to be crucial for normal vascular functioning, which includes the regulation of vascular caliber as well as inhibition of proliferation, thrombosis and inflammation of the vessel wall. Thus, shear stress is atheroprotective. It is also recognized that disturbed or oscillatory flows near arterial bifurcations, branch ostia and curvatures are associated with atheroma formation. Additionally, vascular endothelium has been shown to have different behavioral responses to altered flow patterns both at the molecular and cellular levels and these reactions are proposed to promote atherosclerosis in synergy with other well-defined systemic risk factors. Nonlaminar flow promotes changes to endothelial gene expression, cytoskeletal arrangement, wound repair, leukocyte adhesion as well as to the vasoreactive, oxidative and inflammatory states of the artery wall. Disturbed shear stress also influences the site selectivity of atherosclerotic plaque formation as well as its associated vessel wall remodeling, which can affect plaque vulnerability, stent restenosis and smooth muscle cell intimal hyperplasia in venous bypass grafts. Thus, shear stress is critically important in regulating the atheroprotective, normal physiology as well as the pathobiology and dysfunction of the vessel wall through complex molecular mechanisms that promote atherogenesis.",Atherosclerosis; Cytoskeleton; Endothelium; Mechanotransduction; Nitric oxide; Shear stress; Smooth muscle cells,"nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; artery wall; atherogenesis; atheroma; atherosclerosis; atherosclerotic plaque; blood flow; blood vessel function; blood vessel reactivity; blood vessel wall; cell proliferation; cytoskeleton; gene expression; hyperplasia; inflammation; intima; laminar flow; leukocyte adherence; mechanotransduction; oscillation; pathogenesis; priority journal; restenosis; risk factor; shear stress; short survey; smooth muscle fiber; thrombosis; vascular endothelium; vein bypass; vein graft; wound healing; Animals; Arteriosclerosis; Humans; Shear Strength; Stress, Mechanical","Gotlieb, A.I.; Dept. of Lab.

All estimations include both domestic (differences in market liquidity and credit risk) and international risk factors. The results present clear evidence that it was mostly idiosyncratic rather than systemic risk factors that drove the evolution of 10-year yield spread differentials over Germany in all EMU countries during the seven years after the beginning of Monetary Integration. Conversely, in the case of non-EMU countries, adjusted yield spreads (corrected from the foreign exchange factor) are influenced more by systemic risk factors. The fact that these countries do not share a common Monetary Policy might explain these results, which may show that government bonds from EMU countries have a better safe-haven status that those of non-EMU countries. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Monetary integration; Sovereign debt markets; Systemic and idiosyncratic risk,,"Gómez-Puig, M.; Economic Theory Department, Av.

For example, the recent work on systemic risk relies on estimating risk conditional on an institution being in distress or conditional on being in a crisis (Adrian and Brunnermeier, 2010; Brownlees and Engle, 2011). Specifically, the CoVaR systemic risk measure is based on a conditional quantile when one of the variable is in the tail of the distribution. In this paper, we study properties of conditional quantiles and how they relate to properties of the copula. In particular, we provide a new graphical characterization of tail dependence and intermediate tail dependence from plots of conditional quantiles with normalized marginal distributions (probit scale). A popular method to estimate conditional quantiles is the quantile regression (Koenker, 2005; Koenker and Bassett, 1978). We discuss the properties and pitfalls of this estimation approach. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Copula; Intermediate tail dependence; Linear conditional quantiles; Quantile regression; Systemic risk,,"Bernard, C.; Grenoble Ecole de Management, 12 rue Pierre Sémard, France",,Academic Press Inc.,0047259X,,JMVAA,,English,J.

The desired exposures to risky assets such as stocks, bonds and commodities during these periods of systemic risk should be zero. This paper tests the effectiveness of two market timing strategies that intend to provide early signals for portfolio protection during turbulent times: a filter rule strategy based on the portfolio drawdown (DD) and drawup (DU) thresholds; and an exponential moving average (EMA) strategy based on the crossover of the fast moving average (FMA) and the slow moving average (SMA) of the fund values. The pre-specified market timing strategies are tested on the total return index of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World (MSCI World) Index since the inception of the index in 1997 through 2008. Both the optimal filter rule strategy and the optimal EMA strategy achieve Sharpe ratios that are higher than the Sharpe ratio of the unprotected MSCI World Index. The comparison of the historical risk-return characteristics reveals that the timing of protection is more accurate for the EMA strategy. As is the case for all market timing strategies, the signals provided by the protection mechanism lag the actual economic events. Thus, the market timing strategies tend to be more effective for prolonged economic downturn. © 2012 The Clute Institute.",Active and passive portfolio management; Drawdown; Global financial crisis; Market timing; Moving average; Risk management; Systemic risk,,"Hsieh, H.-H.; School of Business and Finance, South Africa; email: ahsieh@uwc.ac.za",,CLUTE Institute,08927626,,,,English,J.

System-specific ratios are first developed to extract bilateral payment obligations from aggregate payments data in the Australian RTGS system. This synthetic data is then used to generate a deferred net settlement (DNS) system of similar dimensions to those the Australian system would have had, had RTGS not been introduced. Standard default simulation methodology is then applied to test the levels of systemic risk in both this system and the corresponding RTGS system to ascertain the degree to which the introduction of RTGS is likely to have reduced the level of risk. We find that while the level of systemic risk is likely to have been reduced in the Australian case, the size of the effect is small, a finding consistent with the results of payments system studies in other countries. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Because financial crises are realizations of downside risk, we measure their incidence by the skewness of credit growth. Unlike variance, negative skewness isolates the impact of the large, infrequent, and abrupt credit busts associated with crises. We find a robust negative link between skewness and GDP growth in a large sample of countries over 1960-2000. This suggests a positive effect of systemic risk on growth. To explain this finding, we present a model in which contract enforceability problems generate borrowing constraints and impede growth. In financially liberalized economies with moderate contract enforceability, systemic risk taking is encouraged and increases investment. This leads to higher mean growth but also to greater incidence of crises. In the data, the link between skewness and growth is indeed strongest in such economies.",,,,,,00335533,,QJECA,,English,Q. J.

Due to the opacity of the financial sector, outside providers of funds cannot distinguish ""prudent"" intermediaries from those ""imprudent"" ones that voluntarily hold high-risk portfolios and expose themselves to the risk of bankrupcy. We show how the number of imprudent intermediaries is determined in equilibrium jointly with the interest rate, and how both ultimately depend on the cross-sectional distribution of intermediaries' capital. One implication of our analysis is that an exogenous increase in the supply of funds to the intermediary sector lowers interest rates and raises the number of imprudent intermediaries. Another one is that easy financing may lead an increasing number of intermediaries to gamble for resurection following a bad shock to the sector's capital, again raising economywide systemic risk. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Financial opacity; Portfolio correlation; Risk shifting,capital; correlation; financial services; financial system; interest rate; risk assessment,"Challe, E.; CNRS, France; email: edouard.challe@gmail.com",,,00142921,,,,English,Eur.

A systematic review of the association of OSA and NAION has not been performed. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was performed to assess such potential association between OSA and risk of NAION. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed for published studies evaluating the association between OSA and NAION. The summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical risk estimates. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed to assess the robustness of pooled outcomes. Results: A total of four prospective cohort studies and one case–control study met our inclusion criteria. The pooled OR of developing NAION in the subjects with OSA was 6.18 (95% CI, 2.00–19.11) versus non-OSA controls. Sensitivity analyses showed that no matter one study excluded, the pooled OR did not change significantly, which indicated that the evidence was robust. In subgroup analyses, a significant association was seen in studies matched systemic risk factors (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 2.22–11.25), but not in those non-matched. The magnitude and direction of effects were also affected by methodological variability, including study design, and diagnosis of OSA. Conclusions: The findings from this meta-analysis supported the robust evidence that OSA was a strong independent risk factor of NAION. Relative to non-OSA controls, the subjects with OSA were found to have a more than sixfold risk of NAION. In future, more well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Meta-analysis; nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; obstructive sleep apnea; risk factors,"anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; apnea hypopnea index; Article; disease association; human; nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; polysomnography; priority journal; respiratory disturbance index; risk assessment; risk factor; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; systematic review; complication; meta analysis; Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Humans; Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic; Polysomnography; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive","Cheng, J.-W.; Department of Ophthalmology, China; email: jinnwave@163.com",,Taylor and Francis Ltd,02713683,,CEYRD,26443989.0,English,Curr.

In order to differentiate the effect of bank size from that of systemic importance, we control for systemic risk using the CoVaR measure introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We show that a bank's contribution to systemic risk has a significant negative effect on banks' credit default swap (CDS) spreads, supporting the too-systemic-to-fail hypothesis. Once we control for systemic risk, bank size (relative to gross domestic product (GDP)) has either no or a positive effect on banks' CDS spreads. The effect of bank size increases in the home country's debt ratio and turns positive already at moderate debt ratios. This result is consistent with the too-big-to-save hypothesis. We show further that the effect of systemic risk rises sharply at the onset of the financial crisis in August 2007, but weakens after the failure of Lehman Brothers, reflecting changing bailout expectations. Taken together, our results suggest that banks are not too big to fail, but they may be too systemic to fail and too big to save. © CEPR, CES, MSH, 2013.",,banking; credit provision; debt; risk assessment,"Barth, A.; Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany; email: Andreas.Barth@dbb.su.se",,,02664658,,,,English,Econ.

These changes are resulting in increasing stress both at the population and individual levels, possibly leading to mental health problems. Many social variables are subject to rapid fluctuations which, in turn, affect changes in society leading to mental health consequences of the population. In this paper we review the available literature on social variables subject to rapid changes in postmodern societies with links to the DSM-5. Methods Search of papers until June 2015 was carried out using PubMed. We considered only on variables that can be identified in societal changes from modernity to postmodernity and that cause stress, mental distress and mental disorders. Results Discomfort is present in situations where the subject experiences feelings of subjective malaise, beyond the presence of biomedical symptoms. Mental disorders are strongly linked with situations such as technology, markets, economic forces, environmental crises, pollution, demographic crisis and cultures in the building process, including their manipulation.

Scholars and pundits have suggested that increases in student debt resemble the expansion of mortgage borrowing in the years before the 2008 financial crisis, and that higher default rates on student loans contribute to risk of a similar financial calamity in the future. This Article identifies the analogy’s potentially pernicious effects, given the popular narratives attached to mortgage borrowers who defaulted on their debts in the period leading up to and following the financial crisis. Critics of government policies that made homeownership more accessible to poor and minority buyers blamed borrowers, whom they characterized as greedy and foolish. Applying such reasoning to student debt would imply that access to education loans should be limited, a development utterly at odds with the purpose of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Thus, those likening student loans to home loans sing a siren song that could mislead lawmakers, who for decades have sought to use federal aid to make higher education more accessible regardless of students’ financial resources. Further, the Article’s analysis shows that student loans and home loans differ in ways that make it unlikely that defaults could contribute to a crisis. © 2016, Harvard University.

The brandcentric disaster myths generated by media coverage frame public discourse in ways that help to reestablish consumers’ trust in expert systems while also insulating corporations and governmental institutions from more systematic critiques. This analysis contributes to a macrolevel theorization of the institutional and ideological structures that shape consumers’ risk perceptions and just world beliefs.

In a subgroup of subjects, we included genetic data on four AMD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Risk factors for nAMD and subtypes were analyzed. Systemic risk factors for nAMD included older age, male gender, higher BMI and higher HDL-cholesterol. Ocular risk factors included pseudophakic and shorter axial length. Risk factors common to both typical AMD and PCV subtypes included age, BMI and HDL-cholesterol. Shorter axial length was only associated with PCV, while male gender and pseudophakia were only associated with typical AMD. In the subgroup with genotype data, ARMS2 rs10490924 and CFH rs800292 were associated with nAMD. None of the risk factors were significantly different between PCV and typical AMD.

Our main hypothesis is that a high level of domestic debt combined with default risk explains this persistence, even after a decline in inflation rates. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) in a panel data analysis, our results show that inflation risks caused by increasing probability of default account for financial dollarization more than inflation rate itself. After the decrease in inflation rates, the foreign currency-denominated deposits remain large because of the high debt-to-GDP ratios, particularly in speculative-grade economies. High public indebtedness leads to expectations of default.

Although hedge funds are expected to have the capability to at least avoid the impact of such crises by hedging against market movements, the long-term capital management crisis in 1998 and the global meltdown in 2008 showed otherwise. In both cases, most hedge funds suffered large losses; In fact, almost all Dow Jones Credit Suisse hedge fund indexes experienced huge losses. These systemic losses have been associated mostly with large, simultaneous liquidation by market participants, causing a liquidity freeze that crippled hedge funds and spilled over to the general economy (see Brown et al. [2009]; Buraschi, Kosowski, and Trojani [2014]; and Lo, Getmansky, and Lee [2015]). The experiences from these crises have motivated investors, academics, and regulators to better understand systemic risk in hedge funds and these funds' contribution to the overall risk of a portfolio (see Billio et al.

This accelerated pace of change in the financial system reflects the shift from identifying and studying methodologies for loss provisioning and capital measurement and allocation to actually creating the necessary infrastructure and implementing these methodologies to respond to regulatory and competitive pressures. At the highest level, risk management and strategic planning are intertwined. Goals for growth, profitability, and mix of products and services can only be met by carefully planned risk taking. Risk can be idiosyncratic or systemic. Idiosyncratic risk is the risk of price change due to the unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market. In terms of unexpected loss, this risk may be virtually eliminated from a portfolio through diversification, as losses converge on their expected value. In this case, it is called diversifiable risk. In contrast, systemic risk affects an entire financial market or system and not just specific participants or obligors. In practice, financial institutions are unable to completely eliminate systemic risk through diversification, making it a non-diversifiable risk. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The text proposes a framework according to which finance can best be understood as a complex technical system tightly coupled to other social, economic systems. To be more precise, the paper attempts to show how finance is not just any complex system but it can be understood as an ecology of evolving socio-technical systems, sub-systems such as investment banks, hedge funds, high-frequency trading traders, retail investors, pensions funds, etc. All of these are the technical building blocks of our financial markets. Moreover, we attempt to show how concepts from other disciplines, such as entropy, information and noise, can be useful in opening up the world of finance from its traditional economic milieu. Although the following text is confined to the discursive realm of humanities/social sciences, it echoes the analytical approaches of econophysics and experimental economics and particularly the ongoing research around ‘computational evolutionary economics’ [Mirowski, P. 2007. “Markets Come to Bits: Evolution, Computation and Markomata in Economic Science.” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 63: 209–242; Mirowski, P. 2010. “Inherent Vice: Minsky, Markomata, and the Tendency of Markets to Undermine Themselves.” Journal of Institutional Economics 6: 415–443]. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of the so-called robot phase transition from human-dominated trading to the more automatic electronic trading. The current microstructure of automatic market-making can be understood as an ‘ecological niche’ developed by ultra-fast trading algorithms which ‘feed’ on the asymmetries and disparities of the wider ‘financial ecology’. They do this by dissipating noise and adding to the complexity of market microstructure a behaviour that can push the whole ecology to critical thresholds, sometimes referred to as flash crashes. This whole process can ultimately be described by Philip Mirowski's notion of ‘inherent vice’, as well as by Sir Robert May's concept of instability ‘which develops in ecosystems upon increasing bio-diversity’ [Caccioli, F., M. Marsili, and P. Vivo. 2007. “Eroding Market Stability by Proliferation of Financial Instruments.” The European Physical Journal B–Condensed Matter and Complex Systems 71: 467–479; Haldane, A., and R.

The surge in quantity, quality and diversity of financial market participants, instruments and procedures, as well as of resources, is indeed remarkable. Numerous studies have shown that, over time, financial development has been increasingly driven by two major factors: innovation and globalization. A wave of financial innovations has helped multiply the volume of available funding. Simultaneously, the process of globalizing the financial markets has progressed at an extraordinary space. It has been fueled by factors of different natures, such as the IT revolution, capital account liberalization, deregulation of financial sectors and cross-national expansion of huge financial institutions. Financial development feeds into the macroeconomic performance of individual countries and of the global economy. There is broad agreement that financial stability is desirable for economic growth. In particular, international financial stability is perceived as a non-rival, non-excludable public good (Kanbur 2002). As such, it should be pursued by all stakeholders with an interest in maintaining it, as a lack of stability entails undesirable costs for them. The issue of which system is the most conducive to the achievement of international financial stability as well as for reaping benefits to economic growth from financial development is, however, more debatable. One view being advocated is that international financial stability is, by and large, achieved via a system of competitive financial markets, which provides an adequate environment for independent policies of actors such as sovereigns and profit-maximizing investors. Such a framework helps avoid excess volatilities and positively affects growth. The concept of an efficient market can be traced back to the work of Samuelson (1965). A market-clearing mechanism appears to be instrumental to the efficiency of allocation. Within that approach, financial innovations and financial globalization are regarded as important facilitators of economic growth. Under the market system, incentives for innovations, such as profit-maximizing or risk-optimizing behavior, are strong. New and improved financial products, procedures and institutions pave the way for the expansion of economic activity by facilitating the process of trading and risk-pooling, by raising the percentage of savings available for investment, and by improving the allocation of capital and producing higher total factor productivity (McKinnon 1973; Levine 1997). These positive effects are enhanced when financial innovations are allowed to work worldwide. Free financial movements are considered fundamentally sound. An improved diversification of risk and better allocation of capital are beneficial not only to growth, but also to the stability of consumption (Fischer 1998; Summers 2000; Henry 2007). A contrasting view rests on the assumption of imperfect and inefficient markets. Inefficiency is attributed to such distorting factors as information asymmetries, herding behavior or principal-agent problems (Greenwald and Stiglitz 1986). Both financial innovations and financial globalization are producing and channeling considerable risks for the stability of the international financial system. In particular, the synchronized and simultaneous behavior of large fractions of market participants within the global financial network multiplies the effects of single decisions and leads to a systemic risk of excessive price volatilities. New financial products are complex and not well understood by all market participants, thereby reducing transparency and contributing to the underpricing of risk (Dorrucci and McKay 2011). Securitization and sales of products to distant investors bring about a weakening of lending standards. Fast profitseeking and innovative financial institutions attempt to lower their costs and, therefore, expand activities into the least regulated environment. It is further recognized that financial globalization is aggravating risks by producing cross-border externalities and spreading them worldwide. These developments activate and fuel the process of financial contagion across the globe. It is therefore argued that the system of free global financial markets tends to produce excessive volatilities when markets switch from euphoria to excessive pessimism which cannot be appropriately priced through a pattern of the risk premium and returns (Griffith-Jones 2003). In particular, international financial flows may not result in the equalizing of currency-adjusted and risk-adjusted rates of return everywhere. Abrupt, market-led adjustments undermine the stability of the international financial system. In small open economies different causes of financial stress are usually translated into problems in the balance of payments. This refers to both external factors, such as terms of trade shocks or sudden reversals of capital flows, and domestic factors, which include excessive budget financing needs or run-on deposits. External shocks are more likely to lead to balance of payments tensions in economies with non-reserve currencies, even if sound policies are pursued. However, large fiscal deficits and the accumulation of domestic debt may also add to external debt which is further increased by the usually depreciating currency. Recent decades have seen many balance of payments crisis episodes in emerging economies, from Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s, through East Asia, Russia and Brazil in the 1990s to Argentina, Turkey, Ecuador, Nigeria, Venezuela and several European economies over the 2000s. Increasing reversals in international capital flows have posed persistent risk to external balances in emerging economies. Some of these crises have ended as sovereign defaults. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, however, some advanced economies, particularly from the Eurozone periphery, were also affected by serious sovereign external problems. Financial imbalances tend to expand, usually at high speed, across sectors and countries. In 2007 the crisis in the local financial subsector initiated developments that have diffused externally, creating, over time, fears of a global currency war. The view challenging the efficiency of financial markets calls for an inevitable and active policy involvement required to address the balance of payment crisis. Financial contagion, which is speeding up and producing many considerable externalities, may create problems which cannot be dealt with exclusively by individual countries. Approaching international financial stability as a global public good implies, therefore, that coordinated, international actions are more effective than the market mechanism as instruments of response to a financial crisis. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Andreas Pyka and Hans-Peter Burghof.",,,"Wilczynski, R.; Warsaw University of Finance and ManagementPoland",,Taylor and Francis,,9781135084912; 9780415696852,,,English,Innovation and Finance,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121891564,scopus

Methods: 188 patients who presented to us in eye Ophthalmology Department of Sur regional hospital with corneal ulcers were analyzed retrospectively. The historical aspects including the systemic and local predisposing factors, clinical picture of the ulcer which was noted on slit lamp at the time of presentation, results of culture for which material was taken by scraping of the ulcer, and its sensitivity pattern, type of management, and its outcome, were noted and the results were interpreted. Results: 60.83% were males above the age of 60 years. Severe ulcers were seen in 36.17% of cases. 43.18% of cases showed positive culture of which 88.2% were bacteria and rest were fungal isolates. Of the bacteria 53.84% were pseudomonas, and 20% staphylococcus. 83.5% were put on fortified gentamycin and 68.61% were on cefuroxime in the initial dual therapy. 37.23% were on ciprofloxacin one time or another during the course of the ulcer. 69.14% of cases recovered fully and 9.57% improved. 54.25% needed hospitalization for less than 1 week and 34% for less than 2 weeks. 58.76% of cases recovered in less than 3 weeks. As local predisposing factors 45 cases (24%) were post surgery, and 29 cases (15.4 %) were having CDK (climatic droplet keratopathy). Diabetes was seen in 8.5% of cases. Conclusion: Corneal ulcer was seen predominantly in males above the age of 60 years, pseudomonas being the main etiological organism. Dual therapy was the commonest empirical therapy. No major systemic risk factor was identified. Post surgical and CDK were the predominant local risk factors. © 2008, Oman Medical Specialty Board.

This theory offers a new vision of law as fundamentally a macro-level enterprise establishing normative commitments and a framework for numerous private transactions, rather than as an analogue to a market transaction. It explains how neoclassical law and economics sparked decades of deregulation culminating in the 2008 financial collapse. It then shows how economic dynamic theory helps scholars and policymakers make wise choices about how to avoid future catastrophes while keeping open a robust set of economic opportunities, with individual chapters addressing the law and economics of financial regulation, contract, property, intellectual property, antitrust, national security, and climate disruption. © David M.

However, in case the network presents cyclicality, then we need to inspect the average vulnerability of banks to estimate the underestimation gap. We find that the gap is small regardless of the cyclicality of the network when its average vulnerability is large. In contrast, the observed gap follows a quadratic behavior when the average vulnerability is small or intermediate.

The article discusses whether civil liability should be imposed on the leader of a consortium of underwriters (the lead or, more commonly, managing underwriter) and other underwriters of initial public offerings (IPOs) for misleading information in the offering prospectus. The justification of such liability is based on two new models that simulate the decision-making process of managing underwriters. The first model indicates that a statute imposing liability on underwriters plays a crucial role in solving the problem of hidden action by the managing underwriter, in which the degree of effort that the managing underwriter makes in performing due diligence is not revealed in the aftermarket. The second model shows that the managing underwriter acts strategically in setting the offering price and in allotting securities to investors, and that the law plays a central role in reducing the offering-related costs. This model describes the convergence of supply and demand in the bookbuilding method. The principal thesis of the study is that in the current structure of capital markets, the strategic behavior of the managing underwriter of a consortium of underwriters creates substantial costs through its method of distributing securities in the primary market and that this phenomenon justifies imposing civil liability on managing underwriters. In the first model, the moral hazard problem cannot be solved without statutory backing. In the second model, the managing underwriter cultivates a two-way relationship with potential investors during the course of marketing the offering. In this model, the managing underwriter determines the offering price and the allotment of securities to investors in a way that maximizes its profits. In equilibrium, only some of the regular investors perform valuations of the offered securities to the degree that enables efficiency in building a market-demand curve. The model indicates that imposing civil liability on the managing underwriter using the bookbuilding method can increase the efficiency of the allotment mechanism operation. Imposing liability on the managing underwriter is also expected to put some restraints on its strategic behavior in the after-market. Another aspect of efficiency that results from imposing liability, is that the managing underwriter's power to effectively supervise company directors, such as providing oversight of executive hirings and personal interest agreements, is strengthened. Imposing civil liability on managing underwriters is further justified by the fact that managing underwriters are the least expensive insurers, particularly in the distribution of systemic risks.",,,"Sher, N.; Department of Law, , Herzliya, Israel",,,10867872,,,,English,Univ.

Notably, we consider the effect of heterogeneous degree distributions, heterogeneous balance sheet size and degree correlations between banks. We study the probability of contagion conditional on the failure of a random bank, the most connected bank and the biggest bank, and we consider the effect of targeted policies aimed at increasing the capital requirements of a few banks with high connectivity or big balance sheets. Networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are shown to be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank, but more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly connected nodes. A power law distribution of balance sheet size is shown to induce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to contagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the biggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of high average degree.

Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks.

METHODS: Consecutive infants treated with laser at our institution and infants referred from outside centers with progression to stage 4 or 5 ROP after laser treatment were included in this retrospective study. Two groups were identified: those with regression of ROP after laser (LT group; 196 eyes of 98 infants) and those with progression to stage 4 or 5 ROP after laser (ST group; 134 eyes of 80 infants). RESULTS: Using a multiple logistic regression model, there was a statistically significant association for progression of treated ROP to retinal detachment (RD) with history of sepsis (P < 0.001), oxygen therapy (P = 0.003), mechanical ventilation (P = 0.003), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; P = 0.005), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; P = 0.042). On the other hand, jaundice (P = 0.563), anemia (P = 0.599), thrombocytopenia (P = 0.689), and blood transfusion (P = 0.878) did not show a statistically significant association with failure of laser treatment and progression of ROP to stage 4 or 5 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants with a history sepsis, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, RDS, and PDA may be at a higher risk for progression of ROP despite diode laser treatment. © The Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.",Laser; Retinal detachment; Retinopathy of prematurity; Systemic risk factors,"anemia; article; artificial ventilation; blood transfusion; diode laser; disease course; high risk population; human; infant; jaundice; laser surgery; major clinical study; oxygen therapy; patent ductus arteriosus; respiratory distress syndrome; retina detachment; retrolental fibroplasia; risk factor; sepsis; thrombocytopenia; Disease Progression; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Laser Therapy; Retinal Detachment; Retinopathy of Prematurity; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Failure","Gonzales, C.

Over 5900 houses, of which 1600 totally destroyed, and more than 21000 people were reported by local authorities to have been affected by the floods. The most affected areas were situated in Maramures, in Moldova, along the Prut and Siret rivers. These areas include critical infrastructure elements (town halls, border police offices, roads, dams, civil protection facilities) and had a negative impact on the economic activity. The assessment of the effects of the disaster, conducted by the Operational Centre for Emergency Situations (OCES) under the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, has demonstrated the increase of the risk level with implications as systemic risk. Considering the multiple effects and the serious micro and macroeconomic implications, the intervention of the governmental institutions must be prompt and efficient. The lack of experience in the case of these extreme risk events, but also the budgetary restrictions, require, on the one hand, the reassessment of the insurance solutions through the introduction of a new financing scheme based on PPP, or the use of the microfinance products specifically created for natural hazards risk management, on the other hand. Microfinance institutions could be efficient both in disasters, and also in events that correspond to the disaster response and the recovery process. Microfinance institutions could be easily informed on the potential consequences of natural hazards at different levels: clients, institutions, sectors. Microfinance products and services could be robust solutions, because they respond more directly to clients needs in the aftermath of extreme events. Identifying the optimal lending program is a difficult task and it is closely related to the global recovery process. The design of these specific products represents an important contribution in order to develop an efficient recovery process, as the funds will be used more efficiently and promptly, and we consider that innovative solutions should be used for Romania and for other emerging countries.",Extreme risk management (ERM); Microfinance institutions (MFIs); Microinsurance,Affected area; Civil protection; Disaster response; Economic activities; Emergency situation; Extreme events; Extreme risk management (ERM); Financing schemes; Governmental institution; Heavy rainfall; Innovative solutions; Local authorities; Microfinance; Microfinance institutions (MFIs); Microinsurance; Multiple effect; Natural hazard; Negative impacts; Products and services; Recovery process; Risk levels; Robust solutions; Romania; Critical infrastructures; Economics; Floods; Rain; Rating; Recovery; Risk analysis; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Finance,"Prelipcean, G.; Faculty of Economic Sciences and Public Administration, , Suceava, Romania; email: gabrielap@seap.usv.ro",,,,9789604741823,,,English,"Proc.

I argue that we have reached a state of economic development where creativity is a productive force, and imagination is the human activity that propels creativity. The market, I suggest, has become the projective screen for our imaginative capacities. But at the same time, the market itself creates systemic risks that require the exercise of authority and the subordination of imagination to rules and regulations. The result is a tension between imagination and authority. When poorly managed, this tension leads to crises. The chapter is divided into eight sections. In the first, I argue that the 2007-8 financial crisis was less the result of imprudent decisions and more the result of what are called ‘systemic risks’. In the second, I link the idea of systemic risk to what we call within the system psychodynamics tradition, ‘the group as a whole’ and the problem of authority. In the third, I suggest that markets are attractive to the mind not because they are rational but because we project onto them our capacity to imagine. I suggest this is so because increasingly imagination has become a ‘productive force’ in the economy. In the fourth section, I suggest that imagination as a psychic function integrates what Freud (1911) called the pleasure and reality principles, and that this integration takes psychological work to sustain. It is therefore prone to break down into one or the other of its constituent parts. When the pleasure principle wins out, the culture takes on a narcissistic color, and the sense of entitlement replaces the respect for authority. I suggest that the behavior of some bank and financial-firm executives and their employees reflected this sense of entitlement. In the fifth section, I argue that in our valuing of imagination, we therefore risk succumbing to the pleasure principle, which brings us into conflict with the authority system we need to manage systemic risks. But the authority system’s legitimacy is based on the useful work accomplished by the reality principle. Authority expresses the important idea that we must keep our narcissism and impulses in check in order to participate productively in the social world. We experience a conflict between the reality and the pleasure principles instead of their integration in imagination. In the sixth section, I explore the learning from two innovations that William Halton introduced to the Group Relations conference: the resource planning and marketplace events. I show how members’ experience in these events suggests that as imagination is broken up into its constituent parts, the reality principle and the pleasure principle each become social defenses for the other. In the seventh section, I suggest that we replace the idea of social psychology with the idea of psychosociology, a term our French colleagues use, because, increasingly, social and political conflicts are the result of the projections of our mind onto society. The meaning of the classic tension between markets and central planning has been transformed. In the final section, I summarize my argument. © 2012 Susan Long and Burkard Sievers.",,,"Hirschhorn, L.United States",,Taylor and Francis,,9781136666681; 9780415600316,,,English,"Towards a Socioanalysis of Money, Finance and Capitalism: Beneath the Surface of the Financial Industry",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123652632,scopus

Estimation of asset correlation with rating transition data has focused on the point estimation of the correlation without giving any consideration to the uncertainty around these point estimates. In this article we use Bayesian methods to estimate a dynamic factor model for default risk using rating data (McNeil et al., 2005; McNeil and Wendin, 2007). Bayesian methods allow us to formally incorporate human judgement in the estimation of asset correlation, through the prior distribution and fully characterize a confidence set for the correlations. Results indicate: i) a two factor model rather than the one factor model, as proposed by the Basel II framework, better represents the historical default data. ii) importance of unobserved factors in this type of models is reinforced and point out that the levels of the implied asset correlations critically depend on the latent state variable used to capture the dynamics of default, as well as other assumptions on the statistical model. iii) the posterior distributions of the asset correlations show that the Basel recommended bounds, for this parameter, undermine the level of systemic risk. © Revista de Economía del Rosario.

They create a network of interbank exposures by which they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper, we show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to devise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that captures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different impact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax a systemic risk tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the matching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique equilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient, i.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume. On the other hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings exist, which are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively stimulate a ‘rewiring’ of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it more resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume. Moreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like tax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it taxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to have a limited effect on reducing systemic risk while it decreases transaction volume. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Insolvency cascades; Interbank networks; Matching markets; Network formation; Systemic risk; Transaction-specific tax,,"Thurner, S.; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Schlossplatz 1, 2361 Laxenburg, Austria; email: stefan.thurner@meduniwien.ac.at",,Elsevier B.V.,01651889,,JEDCD,,English,J.

Although the chapter was written largely before the adoption of EU bank regulatory reforms in 2011, its main critique that EU bank regulation fails to provide an adequate balance between a common rule-book and common principles remains steadfast, especially in light of the lack of a structured early intervention regime for EU-based banking groups that operate on a cross-border basis. These banking organisations often pose systemic risks across EU jurisdictions and also have depositors in many European states. In addressing these risks, Mayes suggests that a common rule book with trigger points for supervisory intervention may be more eff ective for overseeing cross-border banking groups than primary reliance on common principles of action. While the chapter recognises that both common rules and common principles are important, a common rule book for structured early supervisory intervention is more appropriate for coordinating eff ective oversight of the cross-border operations of European banking groups. For PCA to work on a cross-border basis in Europe, however, it may be necessary to have further institutional consolidation at the European level to improve the oversight of European banks that operate in more than one jurisdiction or which pose systemic risk in more than one EEA state. © Kern Alexander and Rahul Dhumale 2012.

The retinal disorders which may be mis-diagnosed as optic neuritis include Leber neuroretinitis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and Stargardt macular dystrophy. Retinal changes which evolve in neuroretinitis, and the pseudopapilledema in Leber heredity optic neuropathy are helpful in differentiating these disorders from optic neuritis. Stargardt macular dystrophy, a disorder associated with a variety of mutations, may be mis-diagnosed as psychogenic visual loss due to the early normal appearance of the retina, and the loss of vision over a period of weeks. The differentiation of optic neuritis from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), depends upon the initial appearance of the optic disc (in AION either hyperemia due to reperfusion, or swelling and pallor if total infarction has occurred). The authors have described children with abrupt loss of vision during renal dialysis, whose risk factors for AION included systemic hypotension and intra-ocular hypertension. Children with vigorous treatment of accelerated hypertension, and children with migraine and pro-thrombotic disorders have also incurred AION. Thus, AION should be suspected when acute loss of vision occurs in association with certain ocular and systemic risk factors. In children capable of cooperating for visual field examination, the typical change in AION is an altitudinal defect, while optic neuritis it is a central scotoma. The association of optic neuritis with multiple sclerosis, DeVic disease, and with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require special consideration in regard to treatment and prognosis. Acute loss of vision due to cerebral cortical insults involves a large differential diagnosis which includes vascular, metabolic and infective disease; as well as disorders causing transitory blindness such as seizures and migraine.",Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION); Cortical blindness; Optic neuritis; Retinopathy,acute disease; blindness; brain infarction; child; childhood disease; conference paper; demyelinating disease; dialysis; differential diagnosis; disease association; hereditary optic atrophy; human; hyperemia; hypotension; intraocular hypertension; ischemic optic neuropathy; Leber congenital amaurosis; migraine; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; optic nerve disease; papilledema; prognosis; reperfusion; retina disease; risk factor; Stargardt disease; thrombosis; visual cortex; visual disorder; visual impairment,"Chutorian, A.M.; Department of Pediatrics, 68th Street, New York, NY 10021, United States",,Revista de Neurologia,02100010,,RVNRA,12599157.0,Spanish,Rev.

Aim: The aim is to quantify systemic risk as the capital shortfall an institution is likely to experience, conditional to the entire financial sector being undercapitalised. Setting: We measure the systemic risk index (SRISK) of the South African (SA) banking sector between 2001 and 2013. Methods: Systemic risk is measured with the SRISK. Results: Although the results indicated only moderate systemic risk in the SA financial sector over this period, there were significant spikes in the levels of systemic risk during periods of financial turmoil in other countries. Especially the stock market crash in 2002 and the sub-prime crisis in 2008. Based on our results, the largest contributor to systemic risk during quiet periods was Investec, the bank in our sample which had the lowest market capitalisation. However, during periods of financial turmoil, the contributions of other larger banks increased markedly. Conclusion: The implication of these spikes is that systemic risk levels may also be highly dependent on external economic factors, in addition to internal banking characteristics. The results indicate that the economic fundamentals of SA itself seem to have little effect on the amount of systemic risk present in the financial sector. A more significant relationship seems to exist with the stability of the financial sectors in foreign countries. The implication therefore is that complying with individual banking regulations, such as Basel, and corporate governance regulations promoting ethical behaviour, such as King III, may not be adequate. It is therefore proposed that banks should always have sufficient capital reserves in order to mitigate the effects of a financial crisis in a foreign country. The use of worst-case scenario analyses (such as those in this study) could aid in determining exactly how much capital banks could need in order to be considered sufficiently capitalised during a financial crisis, and therefore safe from systemic risk. © 2017.

In developing this contention, three major claims are advanced. First, for all their benefits, CCPs exhibit a major design flaw in as much as they are unable to diversify away marketwide systemic risk when counterparty failures become correlated – as exemplified by the global financial crisis (‘GFC’). Second, this design flaw is remarkably similar to the flaw which the modern trend towards market-based finance exhibits, again, as revealed during the GFC, and as persists in its more recent ‘fund-based’ guise, and that this parallel cautions against viewing CCPs in an unduly favourable light. That is to say, in much the same way that market-based finance helped to neutralise systemic risk in good or moderately turbulent times pre-crisis, but amplified it in times of acute market turbulence, so too CCPs are liable to exhibit similar tendencies. Finally, although the UK’s new regulatory and supervisory regime applicable to CCPs has much to commend it, these measures are, in fact, likely to be of limited assistance in ensuing that CCPs are able to perform their mutualisation role, or that they do not disrupt financial markets, when things go seriously wrong. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"McVea, H.; School of Law, United Kingdom; email: h.mcvea@bris.ac.uk",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,14735970,,,,English,J.

The Polish housing market experienced an unprecedented boom in mortgage lending, house prices and construction after the turn of the century, but this was stopped by the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).

Each bank faces fluctuations in liquid assets and stochastic investment opportunities that mature with delay, creating the risk of liquidity shortages. An interbank market lets participants pool this risk but also creates the potential for one bank's crisis to propagate through the system. We study banking systems with homogeneous banks, as well as systems in which banks are heterogeneous. With homogeneous banks, an interbank market unambiguously stabilizes the system. With heterogeneity, knock-on effects become possible, but the stabilizing role of interbank lending remains so that the interbank market can play an ambiguous role. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops a model of real estate pricing based on rational behaviour with two regimes. In 'normal times' prices of housing units are determined by the consumers who live in them and are equal to the discounted stream of housing services. In 'boom and bust times' speculators find it profitable to borrow from banks and enter the market. There is an agency problem because banks are unable to fully assess the risk that the speculators are taking and this leads to risk shifting and asset substitution. The result is a bubble in real estate prices in that they are higher than the discounted stream of housing services during the boom phase. This model is then used as the basis for analysing macro-prudential polices designed to prevent the occurrence of such bubbles. These measures include monetary policy, fiscal tools such as real estate transfer taxes, and annual real estate taxes and banking regulation such as restrictions on loan-to-value ratios, countercyclical capital requirements and loan provisions.

The tremendous cost of systemic risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the eficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current paper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk. Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures from the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial regulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms of capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two ingredients: A cash ow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations of the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome; and an acceptability criterion, i.e., a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a regulatory authority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of additional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual framework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm for their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case studies. Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal amount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after aggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail out. In contrast, our approach emphasizes operational systemic risk measures that include both ex-post-bailout costs as well as ex-Ante-capital requirements and may be used to prevent systemic crises.",Capital regulation; Financial contagion; Monetary risk measures; Set-valued risk measures; Systemic risk,,,,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Publications,1945497X,,,,English,SIAM J.

Given the new sources of liquidity generated by off-balance-sheet activities, time-varying indicators of leverage become more informative of the leverage dynamics. We introduce a Kalman filter procedure to study such elasticity-based measures of broad leverage. This approach enables the detection of the build-up of financial imbalances-as measured by the increase in bank risk-years before what the traditional assets to equity ratio predicts. Most elasticity measures we propose appear in line with the historical episodes, well tracking the cyclical pattern of leverage.

This conclusion is usually reached under an assumption of independence or asymptotic independence between insurance risk and financial risk. Such an assumption seems reasonable if the insurer focuses on the traditional insurance business that does not interact much with the capital market. However, we shall argue that at least for insurers who partic ipate in financial guarantee insurance and as a result cause systemic risk, asymptotic dependence between insurance and financial risks needs to be considered. Under a bivariate regular variation structure, we investigate the interplay of insurance and fi nancial risks, and show that the asymptotic dependence introduces extra risk for the insurer's solvency. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Commerce; Financial markets; Investments; Risk perception; Asymptotic dependence; Asymptotic independence; Financial guarantees; Financial risks; Insurance claims; Insurance risk; Regular variations; Systemic risks; Insurance,"Tang, Q.; University of IowaUnited States",,CRC Press,,9781498701310; 9781498701297,,,English,Extreme Value Model. and Risk Anal.: Methods and Appl.,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012235309,scopus

Methods: In this prospective study, detailed medical history and slit-lamp examination were performed on all patients prior to intraocular surgery. Patients with local risk factors were defined as those with chronic blepharitis, conjunctivitis or discharge. Those with systemic risk factors were patients with diabetes, autoimmune, immunodeficient or skin disorders, asthma and those taking immunosuppressant medications. Conjunctival cultures were obtained prior to preoperative antibiotics and povidone-iodine. Bacteria isolated were identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined. Bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics were defined as multiresistant (MR). Results: Among the 207 patients enrolled in the study, 73 patients had local risk factors. Of these patients, 32 patients (44%) carried MR organisms, compared to 32 of the 134 patients (24%) without local risk factors (P = 0.0049). Thirty-two of 71 patients (45%) with systemic risk factors harbored MR organisms, compared to 32 of 136 patients (24%) without systemic risk factors (P = 0.0025). Seventeen of 93 patients (18%) who had neither local nor systemic risk factors had MR organisms on their conjunctiva. In contrast, 17 of the 30 patients (57%) with both local and systemic risk factors (57%) carried MR bacteria (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Patients with local and/or systemic risk factors are more likely to harbor MR organisms. This may be one mechanism for the reported increased risk of postoperative endophthalmitis in this group of patients.",,"amikacin; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; antibiotic agent; carbapenem derivative; cefazolin; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; cephalosporin derivative; chloramphenicol; ciprofloxacin; erythromycin; gentamicin; imipenem; immunosuppressive agent; insulin; levofloxacin; meropenem; meticillin; mezlocillin; neomycin; norfloxacin; ofloxacin; oral antidiabetic agent; oxacillin; penicillin derivative; penicillin G; povidone iodine; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; tobramycin; unindexed drug; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; article; asthma; autoimmune disease; Bacillus; bacterial flora; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; blepharitis; conjunctivitis; controlled study; Corynebacterium; diabetes mellitus; endophthalmitis; eye surgery; human; immune deficiency; major clinical study; Micrococcus; postoperative infection; priority journal; Propionibacterium acnes; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; skin disease; slit lamp; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Physiology; Conjunctiva; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Endophthalmitis; Humans; Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors","Miño de Kaspar, H.; Department of Ophthalmology, 300 Pasteur Dr., Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: dekaspar@stanford.edu",,,0721832X,,GACOD,12928904.0,English,Graefe's Arch.

Although the link between this catastrophic disease and very high mortality is well recognized, even after undergoing emergent revascularization, the systemic risk stratification and longterm outcome are currently unclear. The clinical presentation, parameter-related in-hospital death and long-term outcomes of these patients with acute LMCA obstruction undergoing emergency revascularization were carefully reviewed. Methods and Results: From January 2000 through December 2007, 1,588 patients were diagnosed to have STEMI and received emergent cardiac catheterization. The 38 (2.4%) of these 1,588 patients were enrolled into the present study due to LMCA obstruction. The analytical results identified the 30-day mortality rate as 42.1% (16/38). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that renal insufficiency was independently predictive of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR): 5.642; p=0.029), whereas successful revascularization was independently predictive of freedom from in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.174; p=0.044). The cut-off value of a Parsonnet score >20 was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (p=0.002). Conclusions: Even undergoing emergency revascularization for patients with acute LMCA obstruction, the inhospital mortality remains very high. Additionally, the worse clinical outcome was observed in those with renal insufficiency and Parsonnet score of >20.",Left main coronary artery; Revascularization; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction,adult; aged; article; clinical feature; controlled study; coronary artery obstruction; female; heart infarction; human; left coronary artery; major clinical study; male; mortality; prognosis; revascularization; risk; scoring system; ST segment elevation; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Body Height; Body Weight; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Vessels; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping; Kidney Failure; Male; Medical Records; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardial Revascularization; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Smoking; Survival Analysis; Survivors; Thrombolytic Therapy,"Yip, H.-K.; Department of Internal Medicine, No.123, Ta-Pei Road, Niao-Sung Township, Kaohsiung County, 83301, Taiwan; email: hkyip@adm.cgmh.org.tw",,,13469843,,CJIOB,18762703.0,English,Circ.

It builds on the thesis that organizational decisions in the area of public administration are mainly driven by three factors: policy objectives, constitutional restraints, and available resources including staff and finances. In the European Union, the legislator initially pursued the idea of completing the internal market on the basis of the concepts of mutual recognition and minimum harmonization. The Member States implemented the applicable secondary law and supervised the financial institutes according to the home country model with minor forms of cross-border administrative cooperation. Yet, two different regimes existed for the supervision of the provision of services and the establishment of branches by a financial institution on the one hand, and for consolidated supervision of internationally operating groups on the other hand. The inefficiencies of this administrative model surfaced in the wake of the financial crisis from 2007 to 2009. As a consequence, the European legislator decided to reform the decentralized model of supervision and in 2010 introduced a new administrative layer of European supervisory authorities (ESAs). In addition, the supervisory objectives were complemented by a new instrument, macroprudential supervision, which aims at identifying and preventing systemic risks. From the point of view of EU constitutional law, the new system was a considerable step forward in the development of a genuine European administration. However, issues of legislative competence and of the principle of institutional balance were still not fully settled. Only two years later, the ongoing debt crisis in Europe led to a fundamentally new assessment of this supervisory system. With a view to severing the linkages between ailing banksandstrained public budgets, the European Council decided to establish the SSM. Under the SSM regulation, the ECB is directly responsible for significant banks whereas the less significant banks are still supervised by the national competent authorities. This is, so far, the most radical reform in public administration in the Euro area in recent years. It reduces considerably the extent of the decentralized model, streamlines supervisory practices, and bypasses the constitutional constraints which apply to the ESAs. © 2016 Duncker und Humblot GmbH.

But the failure of American International Group in 2008 posed a more complex aspect of financial contagion. This study presents an extension of the asset network systemic risk model (ANWSER) to investigate whether credit default swaps mitigate or intensify the severity of financial contagion. A protection buyer bank transfers the risk of every possible debtor bank default to protection seller banks. The empirical distribution of the number of bank bankruptcies is obtained with the extended model. Systemic capital buffer ratio is calculated from the distribution. The ratio quantifies the effective loss absorbency capability of the entire financial system to force back financial contagion. The key finding is that the leverage ratio is a good estimate of a systemic capital buffer ratio as the backstop of a financial system. The risk transfer from small and medium banks to big banks in an interbank network does not mitigate the severity of financial contagion. © 2014 IEEE.,,Intelligent computing; Risk assessment; Bank transfers; Credit default Swap; Empirical distributions; Extended model; Financial contagions; Financial system; International group; Systemic risks; Finance,"Maeno, Y.; NEC CorporationJapan",Serguieva A.Maringer D.Palade V.Almeida R.J.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781479923809,,,English,IEEE IAFE Conf Comput Intell Fin Eng CIFEr,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908131321,scopus

The study is unique in the sense that CBRT's monetary policy reaction function is augmented with a distinctive financial stress index, i.e. the composite index of systemic stress (CISS). The index pays special attention to the systemic risk component of financial markets by taking into account the cross-correlations between financial market segments. The responsiveness of the CBRT to financial stress is measured by a generic policy interest rate, comprising of the overnight rate, BIST interbank rate and weighted average funding rate. CBRT has publicly announced the change in its policy framework as a response to heightened financial stability concerns after the third quarter of 2010. This study aims to look whether the CBRT's response to financial systemic stress has really changed or not after 2010 by carrying out a subsample regression analysis. The results are further crosschecked with rolling window and interaction dummy regression analysis. The empirical results collected from these econometric exercises indicate that the CBRT's monetary policy was leaning more against financial stress after mid-2010 compared to the previous period. © 2016",Financial stress; Inflation; Monetary policy rule,,,,Elsevier B.V.,13030701,,,,English,Central Bank Rev.,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041136838,scopus

The Banking Act of 1984 paved the way for a substantial regulatory overhaul of the French banking system. The Banking Act also created three collegial authorities, whose functioning is tightly linked to the functioning of Bank of France, to provide control for the banking sector's activities: The Banking Regulation Committee (CRB), the Credit Organisations Committee (CEC) and the Banking Commission (CB). The chapter also presents three waves of regulation. First, it presents the situation during the 1980s and shows how European integration influenced French regulation. Next, it details the impact of the crisis on banking and financial regulation and finally presents the French regulatory framework. With respect to supervision at the European level, in France, the Committee on Financial Regulation and Systemic Risk (COREFRIS) aims to ensure the coordination of the various institutions concerned with financial stability. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Rainer Kattel, Jan Kregel and Mario Tonveronachi; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,Taylor and Francis,,9781317428848; 9781138914049,,,English,Financial Regulation in the European Union,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148846644,scopus

This paper suggests a more nuanced view of the effect of interconnectivity and resource sharing since interconnectivity may contribute to system fragility, which is associated with a possibility of abrupt/discontinuous system transition to a persistent overloaded regime with unacceptably high delays. This possibility is a result of the same system interconnectivity, which enables not only desirable but also undesirable load transfer throughout the networked system. Our results indicate that benefits of dynamic queuing disciplines, including low latency, can be realized provided that the relevant systemic risks of undesirable contagion are eliminated or mitigated. Due to the intractability of conventional performance models of large-scale interconnected systems, we use the 'Complex Systems' methodology, e.g., a mean-field approximate performance model. © 2017 IFIP.",cloud computing model; dynamic queuing; fragility; low latency,Cloud computing; Large scale systems; Dynamic resource sharing; fragility; Interconnectivity; Large-scale interconnected systems; Low latency; Networked systems; Performance Model; System transitions; Queueing theory,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9783901882944,,,English,"IFIP Netw.

Methods: To ensure the safety of this new approach, we have reviewed the personal series of a single surgeon using a standardized skin-sparing technique during 1989 to 2004. Results: Skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed on 225 patients, and standard mastectomy was performed on 1,022 patients. The age distribution was 8 years younger on average in the reconstructed group. The average follow-up for each group was 49 months. The local recurrence for each group was 1.7% and 1.5% (P > .80). The regional recurrence was 3.8% and 3.9% (P > .80). The average time to local recurrence was similar in each group (33.1 and 32.6 months, P > .80).

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed at a tertiary referral eye hospital on patients who presented with DSCH following glaucoma surgery. Cases were compared with a matched-control population that underwent equivalent procedures but did not develop DSCH. The main outcome parameters were incidence of DSCH, risk factors associated with its occurrence, visual outcome and prognostic factors. Results: Of the 2752 glaucoma surgeries performed during the 10-year recruitment period, 29 cases of DSCH (1%) were identified. An increased incidence of DSCH was observed after glaucoma drainage device implantation compared with trabeculectomy-associated DSCH (p<0.0001; odds ratio 3.4; 95% Cl 1.9 to 5.4). Risk factors for DSCH included low postoperative intraocular pressure (≤3 mm Hg; p<0.001), aphakia (p<0.001), prior intraocular surgery (p<0.002), hypertension (p<0.001), anticoagulation (p = 0.002), ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.001) and respiratory disease (p = 0.008). The visual outcome of patients with haemorrhage was poor (logMAR 1.34 (SD 0.41)) and was significantly worse when compared with the control group (p = 0.002).

Materials and Methods: The study included type II diabetes mellitus subjects who were enrolled from a cross-sectional study. Participants underwent biochemical testing and comprehensive ocular examination including stereo fundus photography. The VI was defined based on the World Health Organization criteria. Results: The prevalence of VI was 4% in the cohort. The risk factors associated with the presence of VI included a female gender, age greater than 60 years, low socio-economic status, hypertension, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, neuropathy, use of insulin and alcohol. Various ocular risk factors are nuclear sclerosis, subjects who have undergone cataract surgery, myopia and sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR). After adjusting for the factors using stepwise logistic regression analysis, hypertension, use of alcohol, post-cataract surgery and myopia were not risk factors. Stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that VI was higher among subjects older than 60 years (odds ratio (OR): 4.95 [2.67-9.15]) and those who belonged to a low socio-economic status (OR: 2.91 [1.24-6.85]). The systemic risk factors for VI included microalbuminuria (OR: 2.91 [1.59-5.33]), macroalbuminuria (OR: 4.65 [1.57-13.77]) and presence of neuropathy (OR: 1.97 [1.09-3.59]) among subjects. Subjects with nuclear sclerosis (OR: 36.82 [11.12-112.36]) and presence of STDR (OR: 4.17 [1.54-11.29]) were at a higher risk of VI. Cataract was the most common cause of VI in the cohort. Conclusion: Visual impairment, among type II diabetic subjects (4%), is a major public health problem that needs to be addressed.

One of the reforms that Congress introduced in the Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) was mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives through clearinghouses, in an effort to remake the OTC market more in the image of the regulated futures exchanges. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash or liquid assets, called margin, to cover potential losses and prevent any firm from building up a large uncapitalized exposure, as happened in the case of the American International Group (AIG). Clearinghouses thus limit the size of a cleared position based on a firm's ability to post margin to cover its potential losses. As lawmakers focused on clearing requirements to reduce systemic risk, concerns also arose as to whether the small number of large swaps dealers in existence-mostly the largest banks-might influence clearinghouses or trading platforms in ways that could undermine the efficacy of the approach. Concerns about conflicts of interest in clearing center around whether, if large swap dealers dominate a clearinghouse, they might directly or indirectly restrict access to the clearinghouse; whether they might limit the scope of derivatives products eligible for clearing; or whether they might influence a clearinghouse to lower margin requirements. Trading in OTC derivatives is in fact concentrated around a dozen or so major dealers. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) estimated that, as of the third quarter of 2010, five large commercial banks in the United States represented 96% of the banking industry's total notional amounts of all derivatives; and those five banks represented 81% of the industry's net credit exposure to derivatives. The first group of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. As a result of the high degree of market concentration, the failure of a large swaps dealer still has the potential to result in the nullification of tens of billions of dollars worth of contracts, which could pose a systemic threat. A 2009-proposed amendment proposed to H.R. 4173, which passed the House, would have limited ownership interest and governance of the new derivatives clearinghouses by certain large financial institutions and major swap participants. Sections 726 and 765 in the final version of the Dodd-Frank Act mandate that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), respectively, must adopt rules to mitigate conflicts of interest. However, it allowed the agencies to decide whether those rules include strict numerical limits on ownership or control. In the CFTC's proposed rules to mitigate conflicts of interest, published on October 18, 2010, and on January 6, 2011, the CFTC did choose to adopt strict ownership limits, along the lines of the Lynch amendment. The SEC's proposed rule, published on October 13, 2010, does the same. This report examines how conflicts of interest may arise and analyzes the measures that the CFTC and SEC proposed to address them. It discusses what effect, if any, ownership and control limits may have on derivatives clearing; and whether such limits effectively address the types of conflicts of interest that are of concern to some in the 112th Congress. These rulemakings may interest the 112th Congress as part of its oversight authority for the CFTC and SEC. Trends in clearing and trading derivatives, and the ownership of swap clearinghouses, are discussed in the Appendix. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The announcement that the IMF will provide a rescue package for a country has a positive impact on domestic bank stock prices in the countries receiving the bailouts, which supports the view that these bailouts help ameliorate systemic risk. Our results show that banks in the nonbailout countries generally experience either insignificant or negative abnormal returns, which is contrary to the view of opponents of IMF bailouts, who argue that these bailouts lead to moral hazard among international banks. Our results support the view that the reaction of investors differs from bank to bank, but consistent with the contagion and the heterogeneous creditor hypotheses, banks' stock price reactions are not proportional to their loan exposure. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

In such systems, the lead into a crisis appears to be characterized by a decoupling of the networks from the keystone network. This decoupling can also be seen in the crumbling of the keystone's power structure toward a more horizontal hierarchy.

Objective: To explore whether an increase in urinary cotinine fumarate level is caused by ingested nicotine and cotinine in breast-feeding infants. Methods: We studied newborns at risk for developing asthma and allergies based on a strong family history. We measured urinary cotinine levels in the infants as a measure of environmental tobacco smoke exposure and cotinine levels in the breast milk of breast- feeding mothers. Results: Of 507 infants, urinary cotinine levels during the first 2 weeks of life were significantly increased in infants whose mothers smoked. Breast-fed infants had higher cotinine levels than non-breast-fed infants, but this was statistically significant (P<.05) only if mothers smoked. Urinary cotinine levels were 5 times higher in breast-fed infants whose mothers smoked than in those whose mothers smoked but did not breast- feed. Conclusions: Mothers should be encouraged to not smoke, and parents must be advised of the potential respiratory and systemic risks of environmental tobacco smoke exposure to their child, including the potential for future addiction to smoking.",,cotinine; nicotine; tobacco smoke; allergy; article; asthma; breast feeding; breast milk; environmental exposure; family history; high risk population; human; infant; infant welfare; milk level; normal human; patient education; priority journal; risk management; smoking; urine level,"Becker, A.B.; Children's Hospital of Winnipeg, 820 Sherbrook St, Winnipeg, Man.

If external shocks or excess loads at some agents are propagated to the other connected agents due to failure, the domino effects often come with disastrous consequences. In this paper, we design the least susceptible network to systemic risk. We consider the threshold-based cascade model, proposed by Watts [13]. We propose the network design model in which the associated adjacency matrix has the largest maximum eigenvalue. The topology of such a network is characterized as a core-periphery structures that consists of a partial complete graph of hub nodes and stub nodes that are connected to one of the hub nodes. The introduced network can reduce the turbulence of shocks triggered and prevent the spread of systemic risk. By both mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations, we show that the slightly differences of the structure of network causes systemic risk. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014",,,"Zamami, R.; Department of computer science, National Defense Academy of JapanJapan",,Springer Verlag,00758442,,,,English,Lect.

For this retrospective consecutive case series, microbiologic and clinical records were reviewed to identify all patients with intraocular culture-proven endogenous fungal endophthalmitis treated at a single institution between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2011. Results: Sixty-seven eyes of 53 patients were identified; 51 eyes of 39 patients had positive cultures for yeast and 16 eyes of 14 patients had positive cultures for molds. Patients with molds as a causative organism had significantly shorter duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (molds 3.8 days, yeast 21.0 days, p = 0.002), were more likely to be receiving iatrogenic immunosuppression (molds 57.1%, yeast 7.7%, p = 0.001), have a history of whole-organ transplantation (molds 35.7%, yeast 2.6%, p = 0.001), and were more likely to have hypopyon at the time of diagnosis (molds 37.5%, yeast 6.0%, p = 0.001). Patients with endogenous endophthalmitis caused by molds had significantly worse visual acuity at the time of diagnosis (logMAR visual acuity molds 1.80, yeast 1.15, p = 0.008) and at final visit (logMAR visual acuity molds 1.97, yeast 1.05, p = 0.005) compared to those patients with yeast as a causative organism. There was no significant difference in the rate of retinal detachment between the two groups (mold 12.5%, yeast 30.6%, p = 0.201). Patients with cultures positive for mold were significantly more likely to undergo enucleation (molds 25.0%, yeast 0%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Systemic risk factors for patients with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis caused by molds were iatrogenic immunosuppression and a history of whole-organ transplantation. Shorter duration of symptoms before diagnosis and higher rates of hypopyon occurred in mold cases. While endogenous fungal endophthalmitis is generally associated with poor visual acuity outcomes, infection with mold species was associated with worse visual acuity on presentation and on final follow-up than infection with yeast species. Enucleation rates were much higher in mold cases. © 2013 Sridhar et al.",Aspergillus; Candida; Fungal eye infections; Infectious endophthalmitis,adolescent; adult; aged; article; Aspergillus fumigatus; Aspergillus niger; Aspergillus terreus; Candida albicans; Candida tropicalis; child; Cladophialophora; Cladophialophora devriessi; clinical feature; controlled study; Cryptococcus neoformans; disease duration; enucleation; Eurotium herbariorum; fungal endophthalmitis; Fusarium oxysporum; human; infant; major clinical study; middle aged; organ transplantation; preschool child; priority journal; retina detachment; risk factor; school child; treatment outcome; very elderly; visual acuity; young adult,"Sridhar, J.; Department of Ophthalmology, , Miami, FL 33136, United States; email: jsridhar@med.miami.edu",,Springer Verlag,18695760,,,,English,J.

Periodontal disease shares several common modifiable factors with major cardiometabolic diseases, and may also be an independent risk factor for some systemic disease. Accordingly, periodontists can think more broadly in motivating and enabling reduction of common risk factors for periodontitis, which would help prevent periodontal disease as well as cardiometabolic health. Smoking is a major risk factor for periodontal disease (acting locally andsystemically) and for many chronic diseases; motivating and enabling smoking cessation can be an important means for improving oral and systemic health. Inflammation has a bi-directional association with periodontal disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for local and systemic inflammation and is associated with increased periodontitis. In addition, various nutritional factors play a role in preventing cardiometabolic disease and some of these same factors may also improve periodontal disease status. Dentists can promote healthy lifestyle factors including improving diet, physical activity and weight. Diabetes and its precursors such as insulin resistance and pre-diabetes could lead to complications including periodontitis. Psychosocial factors, such as anger and stress, may also affect periodontal status. This chapter will review nutritional and systemic risk factors for periodontitis, focusing on modifiable common risk factors that also impact cardiometabolic disease, which can be targeted through oral and medical health professionals for improving periodontal and cardiometabolic health. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,,,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781634858106; 9781634857505,,,English,"Periodontal Disease: Diagnosis, Management Options and Clinical Features",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021991826,scopus

CoVaR stands for conditional Value-at-Risk, i.e.it indicates the Value at Risk for a financial institution that is conditional on a certain scenario. In this paper, two alternative extensions of the classic univariate Conditional Value-at-Risk are introduced in a multivariate setting. The two proposed multivariate CoVaRs are constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions (. resp. of multivariate survival distribution functions). These vector-valued measures have the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. Several characterizations of these new risk measures are provided in terms of the copula structure and stochastic orderings of the marginal distributions. Interestingly, these results are consistent with existing properties on univariate risk measures. Furthermore, comparisons between existent risk measures and the proposed multivariate CoVaR are developed. Illustrations are given in the class of Archimedean copulas. Estimation procedure for the multivariate proposed CoVaRs is illustrated in simulated studies and insurance real data. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Copulas and dependence; Level sets of distribution functions; Multivariate risk measures; Stochastic orders; Value-at-Risk,,"Fernández-Ponce, J.M.; Universidad de Sevilla, Departamento de Estadística e Investigación Operativa, Calle Tarfia sin númeroSpain",,Elsevier,01676687,,IMECD,,English,Insur.

Rarely, it can occur in the cerebral or splanchnic veins and these are the most frightening manifestations because of their high mortality rate. A third site of rare venous thrombosis is the deep system of the upper extremities that, as for the lower extremity, can be complicated by pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The authors conducted a narrative review focused on clinical manifestations, risk factors, and treatment of rare venous thromboses. Local risk factors such as infections or cancer are frequent in thrombosis of cerebral or portal veins. Upper extremity deep-vein thrombosis is mostly due to local risk factors (catheter- or effort-related). Common systemic risk factors for rare venous thromboses are inherited thrombophilia and oral contraceptive use; chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are closely associated with splanchnic vein thrombosis. In the acute phase rare venous thromboses should be treated conventionally with low-molecular-weight heparin. Use of local or systemic fibrinolysis should be considered in the case of clinical deterioration in spite of adequate anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with vitamin K-antagonists is recommended for 3-6 months after a first episode of rare venous thrombosis. Indefinite anticoagulation is recommended for Budd-Chiari syndrome, recurrent thrombosis or unprovoked thrombosis and permanent risk factors. In conclusion, the progresses made in the last couple of decades in diagnostic imaging and the broadened knowledge of thrombophilic abnormalities improved the recognition of rare venous thromboses and the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. However, the recommendations for treatment mainly derive from observational studies. © Schattauer 2010.",Budd-Chiari syndrome; Cerebral vein thrombosis; Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis; Mesenteric vein thrombosis; Upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis,anticoagulant agent; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant agent; contraceptive agent; vitamin K group; arm; Budd Chiari syndrome; deep vein thrombosis; human; lung embolism; mesenteric vein thrombosis; mortality; observational study; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; pathophysiology; portal vein thrombosis; postthrombosis syndrome; priority journal; rare disease; review; risk assessment; risk factor; vein thrombosis; antagonists and inhibitors; blood flow; brain vein; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; Hematologic Neoplasms; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; splanchnic blood flow; vascularization; Venous Thrombosis; Anticoagulants; Cerebral Veins; Contraceptive Agents; Diagnostic Imaging; Hematologic Neoplasms; Heparin; Humans; Intracranial Thrombosis; Regional Blood Flow; Risk Factors; Splanchnic Circulation; Upper Extremity; Venous Thrombosis; Vitamin K,"Martinelli, I.; IRCCS Maggiore Hospital, Mangiagalli and Regina Elena Foundation, University of Milan, Via Pace 9, 20122 Milan, Italy; email: martin@policlinico.mi.it",,Schattauer GmbH,03406245,,THHAD,20352171.0,English,Thromb.

Richardson School of Law, United States","Baker, S.H., University of Hawaii, William S. Richardson School of Law, United States","Natural gas sits in deposits across vast regions of the United States, and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) is the current method used to extract it. Fracking for natural gas has been billed as the next economic boon to poor communities and the key to mitigating the negative effects of climate change. But fracking also involves risks: risks to our environment, to our communities, and to our markets. To date, the debate about fracking - and efforts to address concerns about the risks of fracking - has largely been a debate about who should regulate, the federal government, the states, or some combination of the two. Framing the current fracking debate as a federalism question is a mistake. This Article argues that the narrow frame of the current fracking debate misses important features of the problem. It argues that fracking is best understood within the much broader context of development in the United States, and more specifically as an example of an approach to development called ""hybridity."" The Article maps hybridity as comprised of the following three key features: (1) private actors engaged in difficult-to-regulate activities, (2) involvement of public goods, and (3) creation of systemic risk. Drawing together the financial crisis of 2008, the BP oil spill of 2010, and fracking shows that all three share the common features of hybridity, and give rise to a similar suite of concerns. Regulation alone is not sufficient to address these concerns. Instead, the Article proposes several ways in which the hybridity of fracking might be disrupted, thereby easing the overall risks of fracking while realizing its potential benefits.

The empirical analysis relies on financial econometric models, which determine the underlying conditional volatility. We find that improved environmental management system and environmental performance result in reductions in firms' beta. Specifically, our empirical estimates show evidence of volatility clustering, short- and long-run persistence of shocks to the returns of the market and asymmetry in the leverage effect between negative and positive shocks to returns.

Thus, symmetric countries always benefit from relinquishing their authority to a central regulator that establishes uniform regulations across countries.

The euro zone was taken to be, in effect, a victim of ‘collateral damage’ from the fallout of a crisis manufactured elsewhere. The financial systems of core euro-zone countries were held to be fundamentally different from Anglo-Saxon ones and thereby less vulnerable to systemic risks, although there had been a shift towards more capital market-based financial systems amongst European economies. The core euro-zone countries had not seen house price booms on US or UK levels and associated consumption growth; with greater provision of social housing there was not the same expansion of subprime lending. Nor had European countries run major external deficits-overall the euro zone was in approximate balance, with Germany running a clear surplus, and most of the member countries’ trade was conducted with each other. Indeed, the European Commission (2009, p. 48) recently asserted that ‘Overall, the role of the euro area in global imbalances was negligible until the crisis broke’, rather overlooking the role of Germany’s large current account surplus. © Philip Arestis, Rogério Sobreira and José Luis Oreiro 2011.",,,"Perraton, J.; Department of Economics, United Kingdom",,Palgrave Macmillan,,9780230306912; 9780230271609,,,English,An Assess. of the Global Impact of the Financial Crisis,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016715145,scopus

Superficial erosion of the stenotic plaque can be observed in one-third of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In these cases the presence of classic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and smoking favor a state of «vulnerable blood» or high risk. Increased thrombogenicity can exacerbate thrombus formation and is able to trigger an ACS. The vessel endothelium regulates contractile, mitogenic and thrombotic activities of the vessel wall. Risk factors impair both homeostasis and hemostasis of the vessel wall and promote inflammatory signals. Platelet and monocyte activation favors the expression of tissue factor (TF), thus triggering the coagulation cascade with thrombin generation and clot formation. Increased blood thrombogenicity linked to classic risk factors may be associated with circulating TF levels which are much higher than those observed in healthy subjects without risk factors.

Systemic risk factors are commonly associated with RVO, while unclear it is the role of the thrombophilic and coagulation disorders. To evaluate ""classic"" and ""emerging"" risk factors, and to establish a good treatment for RVO. Fifty patients, 31 males and 19 females, with RVO were selected for our study. RVO patients were divided into two groups: those with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and those with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). All patients were subjected to an anamnestic investigation and were tested for thrombophilia, coagulation disorders and hyperlipidemia. Treatment and prophylaxis were evaluated. We have named ""classic"" the systemic risk factors associated with RVO and ""emerging"" those risk factors, haemostasis related, not clearly associated with RVO. RVO occurs more commonly in patients aged over 50. ""Emerging"" risk factors were more frequent in CRVO, ""classic"" in BRVO. Hyperhomocysteinemia is the most common ""emerging"" risk factor related to RVO. 71.4% of tested patients had hypercholesterolemia. Treatment with LMWH would appear to be safe and effective, but the small number of patients considered not allow us a definitive evaluation of its efficacy. Although our study has shown the correlation between RVO and the ""emerging"" risk factors, more studies are necessary to better know the real role of thrombophilic and coagulation disorders in this disease and to determine a specific protocol for the treatment and prophylaxis of RVO. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",Coagulation disorders; Retinal vein occlusion; Systemic risk factors; Thromboprophylaxis,acenocoumarol; acetylsalicylic acid; nadroparin; ticlopidine; warfarin; adult; aged; article; blood clotting disorder; branch retinal vein occlusion; central retina vein occlusion; chemoprophylaxis; clinical article; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug hypersensitivity; drug safety; female; hemostasis; human; hypercholesterolemia; hyperhomocysteinemia; male; priority journal; retina vein occlusion; risk factor; thrombophilia; adolescent; blindness; blood clotting disorder; comparative study; hypercholesterolemia; hyperhomocysteinemia; middle aged; mortality; retina vein occlusion; thrombophilia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blindness; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Female; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Male; Middle Aged; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Risk Factors; Thrombophilia,"Pasca, S.; Center for Hemorrhagic and Thrombotic Diseases, , Udine, Italy; email: sampasca@alice.it",,,09295305,,JTTHF,19669864.0,English,J.

Methods: One hundred and fifty-nine patients with mild diabetic retinopathy who showed one or more soft exudates were recruited. We selected the possible predictors on the basis of relevant factors, including concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and lipoprotein(a) in plasma, and serum level of von Willebrand factor and thrombomodulin. Results: Macular edema was not detected in 94 eyes; focal macular edema was detected in 46 eyes; diffuse macular edema was detected in 18 eyes; and cystoid macular edema was present in 1 eye. The plasma level of IL-6 concentration and the state of the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) correlated significantly with the severity of macular edema (odds ratios = 3.68, 1.70, respectively). Other risk factors were not significantly associated with macular edema. We estimated the probability of macular edema according to the IL-6 level in plasma and the state of the PVD, and were able to predict the probability of macular edema.

We find evidence of a simultaneous relation between systemic risk exposure and sovereign debt yields. This suggests that models of sovereign debt yields should also include the systemic risk of a country's financial system in order to avoid potentially important mis-specification errors. We find evidence that systemic risk of a country's financial institutions and the risk of sovereign governments are inter-related and shocks to these domestic linkages are stronger and longer lasting than international risk spillovers. Thus, the channel in which domestic sovereign debt yields can be affected by another nation's sovereign debt is mostly an indirect one in that shocks to a foreign country's government finances are transmitted to that country's financial system which, in turn, can spill over to the domestic financial system and, ultimately, have a destabilizing effect on the domestic sovereign debt market. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Banking crises; Contagion; Financial institutions; Sovereign debt; Systemic risk,,"Pagano, M.S.; Villanova UniversityUnited States; email: michael.pagano@villanova.edu",,Elsevier,15723089,,,,English,J.

In particular, while an analysis assuming independent, homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one has an unrealistically high number of participants, the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are realistically taken into account.We argue that empirically plausible specifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing does reduce interdealer exposures: the gain frommultilateral netting in a CCP overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements.When a CCP exists for interest rate derivatives, adding a CCP for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures. These findings are shown to be robust to the statistical assumptions of the model as well as the choice of risk measure used to quantify exposures.

The current financial crisis in Europe has arguably casted fresh doubt on the role and need for deposit insurance. In this regard, the deposit insurance system’s rationale is a key starting issue in order to fully understand its design and role within a financial safety net system. Design/methodology/approach – Using the UK regulatory regime as the main reference point, the deposit insurance system’s objectives are divided into two broad categories: depositor protection and financial stability. Findings – It is argued that a deposit insurance system could only be effective if designed to perform key regulatory objectives. Otherwise, authorities will keep resorting to other rescue measures, as this system will never be well equipped to respond to a bank failure. Practical implications – Notwithstanding recent regulatory reforms, there is still a lack of clear objectives and, thus, a clear profile for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, as the UK deposit compensation scheme. In light of systemic risk and increased demands on prudential banking regulation, the UK deposit insurance system should be reformed to perform significant regulatory objectives. Social implications – The further reform of the UK deposit insurance will enhance depositor protection and financial stability, especially amid the euro-crisis. Originality/value – An effective reform of deposit insurance requires a clear role-setting for deposit insurance. To this end, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis of all regulatory objectives that the post-crisis UK deposit insurance system should serve. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bank competition; Bank resolution; Deposit guarantee scheme; Deposit guarantee schemes directive; Deposit insurance; Depositor protection; Financial services compensation scheme; Financial stability; Government guarantee,,"Kleftouri, N.; Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, United Kingdom; email: nikoletta.kleftouri@postgrad.sas.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,13581988,,,,English,J.

DESIGN:: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS:: Five patients (five eyes) with triple infection keratitis were identified. METHODS:: Eyes with polymicrobial keratitis were identified from January 2002 to December 2010. Only culture-positive cases and eyes infected by three different organisms were included. Demographics, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: The size of the corneal infiltrate, presence of hypopyon, pre- and post-treatment best-corrected visual acuity, antibiotic regimen and sensitivity, types of isolated pathogens, duration of infection, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS:: The mean age was 39 years (SD, ±23.4; range, 21-74). Use of topical steroids was the commonest risk factor (80%). Multiple risk factors were identified in four eyes. The average size of corneal infiltrate was 23.5 mm (SD, ±35.2; range, 2.08-85.5), and all eyes developed hypopyon. A total of 15 organisms belonging to 10 species (bacteria=7, fungi=3) were isolated. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were the most frequently isolated bacteria (n=3) and fungi (n=3), respectively. All patients had at least one type of fungal isolate. Infection resolved with medical treatment in four eyes and one eye had to be eviscerated as the patient developed panophthalmitis. The average time taken for infection to resolve was 30 days (SD, ±19.3; range, 13-61). CONCLUSIONS:: A high index of suspicion of polymicrobial keratitis should be made in patients with multiple and systemic risk factors. Use of topical steroid was the most common risk factor. Prolonged course of disease, relatively large infiltrate, and presence of hypopyon and fungal isolates are typical features of triple infection keratitis. © 2014 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.",Keratitis; Polymicrobial; Triple infection,"amphotericin B; cefazolin; ciprofloxacin; gentamicin; natamycin; piperacillin; steroid; antiinfective agent; steroid; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; article; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; Candida albicans; candidiasis; clinical article; contact lens; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; drug sensitivity; eye surgery; female; fungus isolation; human; hypopyon; injury; keratitis; keratomycosis; male; panophthalmitis; priority journal; Pseudomonas infection; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; triple infection keratitis; visual acuity; Bacteria; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; fungus; isolation and purification; keratitis; microbiology; middle aged; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; Female; Fungi; Humans; Keratitis; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Steroids; Young Adult","Ray, M.; Department of Ophthalmology, National University Health System, National University Hospital, 1E, Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228, Singapore; email: mantoshr@yahoo.com",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,15422321,,,24681610.0,English,Eye Contact Lens,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899899681,scopus

If successfully implemented, the convergence would lead to potentially seven global audit-credit rating alliances (the Big 7) in the financial reporting industry, instead of an audit market dominated by the Big 4 and a credit rating market by the Big 3. Given the exploratory, conjectural nature of this article and non-existence of research literature on the convergence subject, issues and ideas discussed in this article, such as the auditor independence issue for assigning GC ratings and CRAs assigning GC ratings through internal audit practices, will inevitably require further conceptual exploration and fundamental research.

Their complexity is characterized by highly interconnected and interdependent physical, cyber, organizational, and economic subsystems through shared resources, decisions, and states. This paper explores potential sources of systemic risks in complex S-o-S by analyzing unique failure modes of such systems in a nonlinear dynamic multiobjective sequential decision-making process. We posit that certain preferences of decision-makers when choosing among multiple competing objectives may reduce the safety margin of a specific subsystem within the S-o-S to withstand unexpected external perturbations due to the interdependencies manifested by shared states among the subsystems. This can contribute to the failure of an entire S-o-S even though all decisions are made based on Pareto-optimality. By quantifying the level of subsystem interdependency caused by shared states, this paper develops a method to mitigate such systemic risks through decomposing and coordinating the interconnected subsystems of an S-o-S in a decentralized way. The implication of the proposed theory is demonstrated using an illustrative example of a highway bridge S-o-S. © 2016 IEEE.",Decision theory; fault trees; reliability; state-space; systems engineering; systems of systems,Decision theory; Pareto principle; Reliability; Reliability theory; State space methods; System of systems; Systems engineering; External perturbations; Fault-trees; Interconnected subsystems; Multiobjective decision; Pareto-optimality; Potential sources; Sequential decision making; Systems of systems; Decision making,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21682216,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

Likewise, states may increasingly be caught in networks of interconnections and dependency, while at the same time they must deal with great social forces and struggles that could yet break key links in the system.

Modern finance is becoming an industry in which the main players are no longer entirely human. Instead, the key players are now cyborgs: part machine, part human.

Next, it explores the evolution and birth of a new investor paradigm in law precipitated by that rise. This Article then identifies and addresses regulatory dangers, challenges, and consequences tied to the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence and computers. Specifically, it warns of emerging financial threats in cyberspace, examines new systemic risks linked to speed and connectivity, studies law's capacity to govern this evolving financial landscape, and explores the growing resource asymmetries in finance.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct an event study to identify spillover effects of operational loss events using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model as a benchmark model. In addition, they conduct multiple regression analyses to investigate the extent to which firm-specific factors or the market environment affect abnormal returns. Findings: They observe significant negative abnormal returns following operational loss announcements exceeding € 50 million for both the announcing firms and their competitors. In addition, they find that stock market reactions occur only within a very small event window around the announcement date, indicating a high degree of market efficiency. Finally, abnormal returns tend to be insignificant for smaller loss amounts. Originality/value: While operational risk is often believed to be strictly firm-specific, the results show that large operational risk events are not purely idiosyncratic; rather, they are systemic in the sense that they have contagious effects on non-event banks. Thus, the authors shed new light on how operational risk affects equity investors’ investment behaviour in an opaque and highly interconnected banking market. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Banking; Contagion; Operational risk; Risk management; Systemic risk,,"Pakhchanyan, S.; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat OldenburgGermany; email: suren.pakhchanyan@uol.de",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,15265943,,,,English,J.

The study captures multiple snapshots of a dynamic financial network and uses counterfactual simulations to propagate shocks emerging from three sources of systemic risk: interbank, asset price, and sovereign credit risk markets. As conditions deteriorate, these channels trigger severe direct and indirect losses and cascades of defaults, whilst the dominance of the sovereign credit risk channel amplifies, as the primary source of financial contagion in the banking network. Systemic risk within the northern euro area banking system is less apparent, while the southern euro area banking system is more prone and susceptible to bank failures provoked by financial contagion. By modelling the contagion path the results demonstrate that the euro area banking system insists to be markedly vulnerable and conducive to systemic risks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",European banks; Financial network; Interbank market; Maximum Entropy; Sovereign credit risk; Systemic Risk,,"Paltalidis, N.; Portsmouth Business School, Richmond Building, Portland St., United Kingdom; email: nikos.paltalidis@port.ac.uk",,Elsevier,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

The Food and Drug Administration currently recommends limiting the use of superpotent topical steroids to 50g per week for 2 or 4 consecutive weeks depending on the formulation, which is mostly based on the exact duration with which phase 3 clinical trials were allowed to be conducted per the FDA. This article reviews all published clinical incidence of adrenal adverse effects in the medical literature, specifically Cushing's syndrome (CS) and pathologic adrenal suppression (PAAS), to try to ascertain a more realistic limit for the safe use of superpotent topical steroids as it pertains to its potential systemic effects. METHODS: Literature search was conducted using PubMed. Only cases of CS and PAAS secondary to the use of Class I superpotent topical steroids were included. Pediatric cases and full articles unavailable in English were excluded. RESULTS: There were a total of 14 cases of CS and 5 cases of subsequent PAAS found in the current literature. DISCUSSION: From our review of these cases, if the amount used per week is within FDA guidelines, it appears that patients needed to use superpotent topical steroids for far greater than 2 or 4 weeks to develop CS or PAAS. CS did not necessarily predict occurrence of PAAS, but in all cases CS appeared to be a prerequisite for developing PAAS. All cases of CS and all but one case of PAAS were reversible. If excessive amount of greater than 50g per week is avoided, it appears that superpotent topical steroids may be safe to use consecutively for months, perhaps even years, without causing systemic effects.",,"steroid; steroid; adrenal insufficiency; adrenal suppression; Article; bibliographic database; Cushing syndrome; drug formulation; drug potency; drug safety; food and drug administration; human; risk factor; skin absorption; systemic therapy; topical treatment; treatment duration; adrenal disease; adult; aged; case report; chemically induced; Cushing syndrome; eczema; female; male; middle aged; psoriasis; risk factor; topical drug administration; Administration, Topical; Adrenal Gland Diseases; Adult; Aged; Cushing Syndrome; Eczema; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; Risk Factors; Steroids","Nakamura, M.; University of California San Francisco, United States",,Journal of Drugs in Dermatology,15459616,,,28697215.0,English,J.

We investigate the stability of several benchmark topologies in a simple default cascading dynamics in bank networks. We analyze the interplay of several crucial drivers, i.e., network topology, banks' capital ratios, market illiquidity, and random vs targeted shocks. We find that, in general, topology matters only-but substantially-when the market is illiquid. No single topology is always superior to others. In particular, scale-free networks can be both more robust and more fragile than homogeneous architectures. This finding has important policy implications.

Apart from its place of origin in United States, more similarities can be tracked down. Both started in financial markets turbulence with its repercussions in decline in industrial production as well as world trade. Existing studies identify several categories of different causes that might have contributed to financial and subsequently economic crisis and its spread around the world. Short term explications point mainly to loose monetary policy, which kept interest rates lower than would have corresponded to real economic situation. In combination with revised Community Reinvestment Act, which enabled even lower-income population groups to invest into real estates, this was a start-up for real estate bubble and consequent problems of many financial institutions once this bubble burst out. However, long term factors of more fundamental nature should not be overlooked. Insufficient and/or rather missing regulations of financial markets at which financial instruments of different kinds evolved during previous period bear its soured fruit. Nontransparent operations of investment bank reinforced with positive ratings of rating agencies, excessive securitization as well as underestimation of systemic risk led to moral hazard with its ramifications in bankruptcies of many financial institutions. Some experts claim that savings-investment imbalance across the world together with increasing oil prices, as well as prices of other raw materials and food have played its role in escalation of the whole problem too. Indubitably, all analysed factors have had its more or less significant impact on current economic situation. Ensuing measures taken by governments and central banks to mitigate crisis impact on national economies together with state budgets current condition as well as spillover effects of such measures are to be discussed in more detail in following research.",Economic crisis; Financial market regulations; Fiscal policy; Interest rates; Monetary policy; Subprime mortgages,,"Lungová, M.; Technická univerzita v Liberci, Czech Republic; email: miroslava.lungova@tul.cz",,Technical University of Liberec,12123609,,,,Czech,E M Ekon.

This paper considers the economic and strategic drivers of SIFIs - if such institutions are a key source of systemic risk, it is important to understand how and why they get that way. The paper then sets forth a public-interest perspective on the financial architecture by setting out key benchmarks - static and dynamic efficiency, stability and robustness, and competitiveness - and the tradeoffs that exist between them, and examines how SIFIs can support or detract from these benchmarks. If SIFIs are to be subject to much sharper prudential regulation, its impact must be calibrated against systemic performance benchmarks. Finally, the paper focuses on some of the major regulatory initiatives following the 2007-09 financial crisis, and in particular the US Dodd-Frank legislation of 2010, in terms of their possible impact on business models of SIFIs. The paper concludes that improving the financial architecture in a disciplined, consistent, internationally coordinated and sustained manner with a firm eye to the public interest should ultimately be centered on market discipline. By being forced to pay a significant price for the negative externalities SIFIs generate - in the form of systemic risk - managers and boards will have to draw their own conclusions regarding optimum institutional strategy and structure in the context of the microeconomics and industrial organization of global financial intermediation. If this fails, constraints on their size, complexity and interconnectedness will be a major part of the policy reaction to the next financial crisis. © 2012.",Economies of scale; Economies of scope; Financial architecture; Regulation; Shadow banking; Systemic risk,,"Walter, I.; Stern School of Business, United States; email: iwalter@stern.nyu.edu",,,10629769,,,,English,Q.

The impact on liquidity buffers and the probability of a liquidity shortfall is simulated by a Monte Carlo approach. An application to Dutch banks illustrates that the second-round effects in specific scenarios could have more impact than the first-round effects and hit all types of banks, indicative of systemic risk. This lends support policy initiatives to enhance banks' liquidity buffers and liquidity risk management, which could also contribute to prevent financial stability risks.

Other reliable methods with lower side effects and shorter test duration are being investigated. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the nasal provocation test (NPT) and the basophil activation test (BAT) in the diagnosis of different subtypes of aspirin sensitivity. Methods: Thirty aspirin sensitivity patients with cutaneous and respiratory manifestations underwent NPT and BAT with lysine-ASA. NPT result was interpreted as recommended in EAACI/GA2LEN guidelines and receiver operating characteristic analysis of BAT was performed by using 15 NSAIDs tolerant volunteers as a control group. Results: NPT was positive in 60% (18/30) of patients and BAT was positive in 76.7% (23/30) of patients. The incubation of basophils with 0.31. mg/ml of lysine-aspirin and using 4.6% activated basophils gives the best predictive values to diagnose aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests yielded positive results in 80% and 93.3% of aspirin-induced cutaneous and respiratory patterns. The agreement between NPT and BAT results was 63.3%. Conclusions: NPT and BAT are beneficial to detect patients with aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests have additional diagnostic values; less time-consuming than OPT and their complications are negligible.

Although they exhibit similar cash flow patterns (economic perspective) this article argues that from a legal, accounting and regulatory perspective credit default swaps (CDS) are not considered to be an insurance contract. The protection buyer of a CDS is eligible to obtain the compensation without suffering any loss (and potentially realizing a gain) whereas insurance policies only pay out to compensate a loss (and not potentially realizing a gain). This disconnect between protection and exposure is the source for potential over-coverage. Furthermore, the concentrated set of reference entities and (interbank) counterparties as well as their tradeability make CDS highly systemically significant products. Our conclusion is that CDS are not default insurance policies and their systemic risk potential sharply contrasts the limited systemic risk in the insurance industry. We propose to use “default protection” instead of “credit default insurance” to avoid the mislabelling. The legal classification of CDS as insurance contracts would have an enormous impact on the liquidity of CDs, as the ability of counterparties to issue and participate in CDS contracts would be limited. © Copyright by author(s).",Credit Default Insurance; Credit Default Swaps; Insurance Contract,,"Schmaltz, C.; Aarhus University, Denmark",,CLUTE Institute,08927626,,,,English,J.

The reason for writing this paper is that applying single risk communication strategy for public often fails because food risks are systemic risks and public perceptions toward them consist of multiple dimensions. Launching an effective risk communication need to investigate the perception dimensions of the target audience. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 2,673 parents of 3-14-year-old children from the rural area of Sichuan province in China were chosen as target audience. Based on the survey conducted about parents’ food risk perceptions, this study used factor-cluster analysis method to segment parents to sub-clusters with significantly different risk perception dimensions. Parents’ representative demographic characteristics within each cluster were further identified through cross-tabs analysis with χ2 tests. Findings: All the parents could be segmented into four sub-clusters, namely, sensitive parents, dependent parents, familiarity-oriented parents and institutional distrust parents, according to their risk perception difference on five dimensions. A series of risk communication strategies were specifically designed for each cluster based on their risk perception features as well as demographic characteristics. Originality/value: The insight derived from this study described a deeper image of public risk perceptions and provided suggestions for risk communication launchers to pinpoint the risk perception as well as perception dimensions of the target audience and accordingly develop effective risk communication strategies. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",China; Food risk perception; Parents; Risk communication; Risk perception dimensions,adolescent; chi square test; child; China; cluster analysis; human; human experiment; perception; population model; rural area; writing,"Li, J.; School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development, China; email: lijiajie@ruc.edu.cn",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,0007070X,,,,English,Br.

The proposed risk measures aim to capture extreme tail co–movements among several multivariate connected market participants experiencing contemporaneous distress instances. Analytical expressions for the risk measures are obtained under a parametric model that postulates a joint dynamic evolution of the underlying institutions' losses and gains.

However, despite such advances, these diseases remain highly prevalent in industrialized nations, and the recent increase in obesity and diabetes, especially in children, forecasts a resurgence in the incidence of atherosclerosis-associated morbidity. Over the last three decades, the field has rediscovered the critical role that inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. An important component of inflammation is the emigration of leukocytes from the blood into tissues. The vascular endothelium, being situated at the interface between the blood and tissues, has important regulatory functions in atherosclerosis. In normal arteries, the endothelium has homeostatic functions, including nonadhesive and antithrombotic properties, and it provides a barrier to plasma protein and lipoprotein extravasation (1). Endothelial cells (ECs) are not a passive impermeable “Teflon-like” lining, but are active cells, which respond to diverse blood-and tissue-derived stimuli. For example, in response to the repertoire of local cytokines and modified lipoprotein components, ECs synthesize and present molecules that regulate the recruitment of distinct leukocyte subpopulations to atherosclerotic lesions. Profound and diverse changes in EC phenotype in response to different cytokines have been referred to as EC activation (2). ECs also can respond to external mechanical forces, including hemodynamic forces of blood (3). This is probably why atherosclerotic lesions initially form at sites of arterial branches and curvatures. These regions have unique hemodynamics and EC gene expression patterns that influence signaling, the cellular composition of intimal cells, and responses to systemic risk factors for atherosclerosis © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009.",,,"Cybulsky, M.I.; Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Canada",,Cambridge University Press,,9780511546198; 0521853761; 9780521853767,,,English,Endothelial Biomedicine,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928865587,scopus

We document strong evidence that, since the early 1980s, consumption has been increasingly funded by smaller savings, booming financial profits, wealth extracted from house price appreciation and explosive debt. This is in stark contrast with the productivity-fueled growth that was seen in the 1950s and 1960s. We describe the transition, in gestation in the 1970s, towards the regime of the “illusion of the perpetual money machine”, which started at full speed in the early 1980s and developed until 2008. This regime was further supported by a climate of deregulation and a massive growth in financial derivatives designed to spread and diversify the risks globally. The result has been a succession of bubbles and crashes, including the worldwide stock market bubble and great crash of October 1987, the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s, the burst in 1991 of the enormous Japanese real estate and stock market bubbles, the emerging markets bubbles and crashes in 1994 and 1997, the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis of 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting in 2000, the recent house price bubbles, the financialization bubble via special investment vehicles, the stock market bubble, the commodity and oil bubbles and the current debt bubble, all developing jointly and feeding on each other until 2008. This situation may be further aggravated in the next decade by an increase in financialization, through exchange-traded-funds (ETFs), speed and automation, through algorithmic trading and public debt, and through growing unfunded liabilities. We conclude that, to get out of this catch 22 situation, we should better manage and understand the incentive structures in our society, we need to focus our efforts on our real economy and we have to respect and master the art of planning and prediction. Only gradual change, with a clear long term planning, can steer our financial and economic system from the turbulence associated with the perpetual money machine to calmer and more sustainable waters. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Economic growth; Financial bubbles; Financial crises; Financialization; Monetary policy; Productivity; Systemic risks,,"Sornette, D.; Department of Management, Scheuchzerstrasse 7, Switzerland; email: dsornette@ethz.ch",,MDPI,22279091,,,,English,Risks,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905818485,scopus

Design: Retrospective study. Methods: Records of all AION patients seen between 1989 and 2006 were reviewed. Patients younger than 50 years when initial visual loss occurred were included. Results: Of 727 consecutive patients with AION, 169 (23%) were younger than 50 years (median, 43 years; range, 13 to 49 years; 58% men; 93% White). Involvement was unilateral in 59% of patients and bilateral in 41%. At least one cardiovascular risk factor was found in 74% of patients. Hypercoagulable states and vasculitis were found in 8%. An underlying small or anomalous optic disk was found in 92% of eyes (210/230). Isolated disk anomalies (without systemic risk factors) were present in 26% of eyes. Final visual acuities were 20/40 or better in 64% of eyes and 20/200 or worse in 22%. Among patients with bilateral involvement, final visual acuity was similar in the two eyes in 70% of patients. Anemia and type I diabetes were associated significantly with fellow eye involvement. Recurrent AION in the same eye occurred in 6% of patients. Conclusions: AION in younger patients is not uncommon and represents 23% of AION patients in a tertiary neuro-ophthalmic service. Except for giant cell arteritis, ocular and systemic risk factors and associated disorders are similar to those described in older AION patients.

The framework models investment funds' distress dependence explicitly and captures the time-varying non-linearities and feedback effects typical of financial markets. It measures investment funds' systemic credit risk in three forms: (1) credit risk common to all funds within each of the seven categories the Eurosystem reports to the ECB; (2) credit risk in each category of investment fund conditional on distress on another category of investment fund and; (3) the buildup of investment funds' vulnerabilities over time which may unravel disorderly. In addition, the estimates of the common components of the investment funds' distress measures contain early warning features, and the identification of their drivers is useful for macroprudential policy. The ranking of drivers of those common components in terms of importance differs from the ranking of the drivers of the common components of marginal measures of distress.

The goal of our study is to investigate how these two channels of risk interact to propagate individual defaults to a systemwide catastrophe. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that incorporates both channels of risk, and exploit the problem structure to generate the solution (to the clearing payment vector) via a partition algorithm. Through sensitivity analysis, we are able to identify two key contributors to financial systemic risk, the network multiplier and the liquidity amplifier, and to discern the qualitative difference between the two, confirming that the market liquidity effect has a great potential to cause systemwide contagion. We illustrate the network and market liquidity effects-in particular, the significance of the latter-in the formation of systemic risk with data from the European banking system. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of certain policy interventions. In addition, our algorithm can be used to pin down the changes of the net worth (marked to market) of each bank in the system as the spillover effect spreads, so as to estimate the extent of contagion, and to provide a metric of financial resilience as well. Our framework can also be easily extended to incorporate the effect of bankruptcy costs. © 2016 INFORMS.",Contagion; Financial network; Market liquidity; Systemic risk,Commerce; Constrained optimization; Optimization; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Contagion; Financial institution; Financial networks; Market liquidity; Partition algorithms; Qualitative differences; Systemic risks; Finance,,,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences,0030364X,,OPREA,,English,Oper Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991503904,scopus

Ex ante anticipation of greater regulatory forbearance, in case of joint failures, incentivize banks to keep their portfolios highly concentrated so as to succeed and fail simultaneously. However, when depositors are insured, regulatory forbearance is minimal and banks do not have incentives for failing together. Also, subordinate debt can penalize banks for increasing asset correlations since the payoffs to the subordinate debt are negatively influenced by higher correlations. The featuring of deposit insurance along with subordinate debt incentivizes banks to choose lower asset correlations among themselves as their respective optimal strategies. Therefore, the choice of lower asset correlations by the banks mutually represents a Nash equilibrium with reduced systemic risk endogenously. © International Economic Society.",Deposit insurance; Market discipline; Risk monitoring; Risk shifting; Subordinate debt; Systemic risk,,"Chauhan, G.S.; Indian Institute of Management IndoreIndia; email: f08gauravc@iimidr.ac.in",,International Economic Society,13071637,,,,English,Int.

All subjects underwent conventional oral examinations to identify mucosal lesions according to the EC-Clearinghouse/World Health Organization classifications.Results: The findings revealed that 68% of the HIV group exhibited HIV-related lesions compared with 4% in the control group. The most commonly observed oral or peri-oral HIV manifestations, which were statistically different between the groups were in descending order, mucosal hyperpigmentation: 28 (56%), candidiasis: 7 (14%), dry lips/dry mucosa: 6 (12%), and unilateral or bilateral swelling of major salivary glands: 5 (10%). Other non HIV-related oral lesions that were reported more in the HIV group than the control group was coated tongue and leukoedema (p<0.05). The relationship of the reported HIV oral manifestations to demographic data, some relevant local and systemic risk factors, and medical characteristics of the HIV population were analyzed, however, the results showed no statistical significant relations were observed (p>0.05).Conclusion: Oral mucosal conditions were highly prevalent in HIV-infected patients, which suggested that patients with HIV should undergo periodic oral examinations, and patients with HIV-related lesions should undergo screening tests for HIV infection. © 2014, Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

To study how sub-markets are mutually co-dependent, we combine granular data on over-the-counter derivatives by trade repositories and the joint probability of distress (JPoD) approach introduced by the International Monetary Fund. We define an indicator that combines several distress drivers and observe that results on co-dependencies are similar to those that would be expected: similarities between financial and contractual terms seem to be responsible for stronger co-movements among sub-markets. However, high values for JPoD even in correspondence of quite dissimilar sub-markets suggest the presence of other drivers that should be investigated in future research.

The article begins by examining the critical reaction both in Australia and abroad to the doctrine which appeared to imply Australia's increased reliance on the 'special relationship' with the US and its role as a 'deputy' of its ANZUS partner in the East Asia region. The article then demonstrates the historical origins of the doctrine's thinking in Australia's reliance since the post-war period on a system of serial bilateralism and special relationships with first the UK, the US and then Indonesia. However, the article also points out the essential vulnerabilities inherent in this type of serial bilateralism and its relative inability to respond effectively to the East Timor crisis. Finally, the article considers the systemic risk in Australian policy as manifested in the doctrine, and the future viability of serial bilateralism in dealing with Australia's regional diplomatic and security agenda. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Australia; Bilateralism; East Timor; John Howard; Security; USA,diplomatic relations; foreign policy; international relations; policy analysis; Australia; East Timor,"Leaver, R.; School of Political and International Studies, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, 5001, Australia; email: ptrll@sigma.sss.�inders.edu.a",,,09512748,,,,English,Pac.

We examine some previous insurance crises and consider the effect of the crisis on insurance risk-the liabilities arising from contracts that insurers underwrite. We then analyse the effects of the crisis on the performance of insurers in different markets and assess the extent of systemic risk in insurance. We conclude that, while systemic risk remains lower in insurance than in the banking sector, it is not negligible and has grown in recent years, partly as a consequence of insurers increasing links with banks and their recent focus on non-(traditional) insurance activities, including structured finance. We conclude by considering the structural changes in the insurance industry that are likely to result from the crisis, including possible effects on bancassurance activity, and offer some thoughts on changes in the regulation of insurance markets that might ensue. © 2011 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.",credit risk; financial crisis; Insurance; systemic risk,,"Baluch, F.; Commerzbank, , London EC3V OHR, United Kingdom",,,10185895,,,,English,Geneva Pap. on Risk Insur.

Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on patients who underwent cataract surgery in a public hospital over an 11-year period. An ocular infection database was used to report endophthalmitis occurrences and to collect the clinical features. Qualitative variables are described with their frequency distribution and qualitative variables, with the mean and the standard deviation. Results: From January 1999 to December 2009, 15.173 patients underwent cataract surgery. A total of 43 patients suffered from postoperative endophthalmitis, giving an overall infection rate of 0.28% (95% CI: 0.20-0.36%). Among the 43 cases, there were 19 men and 24 women with a mean age of 78.5. Other clinical parameters evaluated were as follows: 25.58% were diabetic, 44.18% had some degree of immunosuppression and there were complications with posterior capsular tears in 18.6%. As regards antibiotic prophylaxis, 2 groups were considered: the first one did not receive intracameral antibiotic (8,099 patients) and the second group received intracameral cefuroxime (7,074 patients). There were 39 endophthalmitis in the first group with an infection incidence of 0.48% and 4 endophthalmitis in the second group with an infection incidence of 0.056%. The relative risk (RR) after-before cefuroxime was 0.12 (0.04-0.33) with P < 0.05. Conclusions: The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in an 11-year period was lower than 0.3%. Almost half of the patients had a higher systemic risk. Intracameral cefuroxime resulted in nearly a 9-fold reduction in the rate of infection. © 2010 Sociedad Española de Oftalmología.

Single Photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is routinely applied for MPI allowing the characterisation of localisation, extent and severity of perfusion abnormalities. Several radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced to study myocardial perfusion enabling accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The documented prognostic value of scintigraphic parameters is of clinical importance to guide decision making in the work up of the cardiac patient. Event rates associated with a normal or low-risk MPI study have been shown to be <1%/year of follow-up. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of radionuclide imaging in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected CAD has been extensively demonstrated. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the most advanced scintigraphic imaging technique developed for in-vivo assessment of cardiac physiology and biochemistry. Assessing myocardial blood flow at rest and under stress conditions and calculating (regional) coronary flow reserve by N-13 ammonia, Rb-82 or O-15 water PET is the most sensitive means to detect any abnormal vasoreactivity which is already found at very early stages of the atherosclerotic process before any angiographic or clinical evidence of CAD. Flow tracers provide also quantitative information on the hemodynamic effects of any local, invasive (angioplasty) or systemic (risk factor modification) intervention.

We therefore aimed to assess cardiovascular risk factor profiles of consecutive patients hospitalized with TIA/IS to stratify the risk of recurrent stroke according to the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) and of future cardiovascular events according to the ankle brachial index (ABI) as a marker of generalized atherosclerosis Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, 85 neurological stroke units throughout Germany documented cardiovascular risk factor profiles of 10 consecutive TIA/IS patients on standardized questionnaires. Screening for PAD was done with Doppler ultrasonography to calculate the ABI. Results: A total of 852 patients (57% men) with a mean age of 67±12.4 years were included of whom 82.9 % had IS. The median National Institutes of Health stroke sum score was 4 (TIA: 1). Arterial hypertension was reported in 71%, diabetes mellitus in 26%, clinical PAD in 10%, and an ABI ≤ 0.9 in 51%. An ESRS ≥ 3 was observed in 58%, which in two previous retrospective analyses corresponded to a recurrent stroke risk of ≥ 4%/year. The correlation between the ESRS and the ABI was low (r = 0.21). Conclusion: A high proportion of patients had asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease and a considerable risk of recurrent stroke according to the ABI and ESRS category.

Vascular leakage, angiogenesis and neuronal degeneration are key features of DR. Current effective interventions for DR include treatment of systemic risk factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ocular treatments include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibitors, laser photocoagulation and surgery. While anti-VEGF therapy has become as first-line treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) that causes reduced vision, intravitreal glucocorticoids also have been shown to be efficacious in this situation. It has been reported that all the major pathological processes of DR are susceptible to glucocorticoid treatment. The effects of glucocorticoids on vascular leakage and angiogenesis may be mediated through their well established anti-inflammatory role. Alternatively, glucocorticoids may affect other mechanisms known to be activated in DR. Potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids include blockage of cytokine production and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion induced by VEGF-A. Glucocorticoids decrease the expression of VEGF-A directly, and increase the production, or decrease phosphorylation, of tight junction-associated proteins. Glucocorticoids have also been shown to be neuroprotective, in contrast to VEGF-A inhibitors which animal studies suggest may be neurotoxic. This review outlines the biological properties of synthetic glucocorticoids, with particular emphasis on the potential beneficial effect of combining glucocorticoids with anti-VEGF treatment for DME and DR. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",Diabetic retinopathy; Glucocorticoid receptors; Glucocorticoids; Neuronal protection,betamethasone; chemokine receptor; dexamethasone; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; fk 506 binding protein; fluocinolone acetonide; glucocorticoid; glucocorticoid receptor; heat shock protein 70; heat shock protein 90; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interleukin 1; interleukin 12; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; interleukin 9; lymphotoxin; methylprednisolone; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; occludin; placebo; prednisone; tight junction protein; transcription factor AP 1; triamcinolone acetonide; tumor necrosis factor; unindexed drug; vasculotropin inhibitor; glucocorticoid; angiogenesis; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; blood retina barrier; cataract; central retina artery occlusion; connective tissue disease; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; drug bioavailability; drug mechanism; drug structure; electric resistance; endophthalmitis; genetic transcription; human; hypopyon; intraocular pressure abnormality; Kirisawa uveitis; laser coagulation; leukocyte adherence; ligand binding; myopia; nerve cell degeneration; neuroprotection; nonhuman; open angle glaucoma; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); protein expression; protein phosphorylation; randomized controlled trial (topic); retina detachment; retina exudate; review; signal transduction; transactivation; vitreous hemorrhage; animal; chemistry; diabetic retinopathy; macular edema; metabolism; Animals; Diabetic Retinopathy; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Macular Edema,"Zhang, X.; Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, Tongren Eye Centre, Tongren Hospital, Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Key Lab, Capital Medical University, 100730, China; email: mmzxy2010@163.com",,Bentham Science Publishers B.V.,15665240,,CMMUB,24467200.0,English,Curr.

On the one side, research focuses on the impact of monetary policy on economic growth, unemployment, and output-price inflation, while ignoring financial aspects. On the other side, some scholars leave aside macroeconomics in order to study the narrow, but crucial, subjects of financial behaviours, and financial supervision and regulation. This book aims at merging both approaches by using macroeconomic analysis to show that financial considerations should be the main preoccupation of central banks. Eric Tymoigne shows how different views regarding the conception of asset pricing lead to different positions regarding the appropriate role of a central bank in the economy. In addition, Hyman P. Minsky's framework of analysis is used extensively and is combined with other elements of the Post Keynesian framework to study the role of a central bank. Tymoigne argues that central banks should be included in a broad policy strategy that aims at achieving stable full employment. Their sole goal should be to promote financial stability, which is the best way they can contribute to price stability and full employment. Central banks should stop moving their policy rate frequently and widely because that creates inflation, speculation, and economic instability. Instead, Tymoigne considers a pro-active financial policy that does not allow financial innovations to enter the economy until they are certified to be safe and that focuses on analyzing systemic risk. He argues that central banks should be a guide and a reformer that allow a smooth financing and funding of asset positions, while making sure that financial fragility does not increase drastically over a period of expansion. This book will be of interest to students and researchers engaged with central banking, macroeconomics, asset pricing and monetary economics. © 2009 éric Tymoigne.

Specifically, differences between taking risks that affect primarily the shareholders of the institution and risks contributing to the overall systemic risk of the financial sector are examined. Additionally, differences between risk-taking before, during and after the financial crisis of 2007/2008 are examined. Design/methodology/approach: To analyze the determinants of stand-alone and systemic risk, a generalized linear model including size, governance, charter value, business cycle, competition and control variables is estimated. Furthermore, Granger causality tests are conducted. Findings: The results show that systemic risk has a positive effect on valuation and that corporate governance has no significant effect on risk-taking. The influence of competition is conditional on the state of the economy and the risk measure used. Systemic risk Granger-causes idiosyncratic risk but not vice versa. Research limitations/implications: The major limitations of this study are related to the analyzed subset of large financial institutions and important risk-culture variables being omitted. Practical implications: The broad policy implication of this paper is that systemic risk cannot be lowered by market discipline due to the moral hazard problem. Therefore, regulatory measures are necessary to ensure that individual financial institutions are not endangering the financial system. Originality/value: This study contributes to the empirical literature on bank risk-taking in several ways. First, the characteristics of systemic risk and idiosyncratic risk are jointly analyzed. Second, the direction of causality of these two risk measures is examined. Moreover, this paper contributes to the discussion of the effect of competition on risk-taking. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bank risk-taking; Bank valuation; Financial crisis; Systemic risk,,"Strobl, S.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Finland; email: drsstrobl@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,15265943,,,,English,J.

The overriding theme of the book is to pose two approaches to attaining financial stability in the future. One approach is to establish a council of wise men and women supported by an army of highly skilled professional financial economists to formulate and implement regulations designed to prevent future financial crises that wreak havoc on the real economy and require financial support from taxpayers. This is the approach of the Dodd-Frank Act. The second approach proposed by the authors of this book is to design a taxing system that taxes systemically important financial institutions on the basis of their contribution to systemic risk. Borrowing ideas from the literature on the taxation of negative externalities their view is that financial institutions that create crises should pay for the clean-up. They also argue that requiring the financial polluters to pay for the creation of systemic risk will reduce the supply of systemic risk.

Measuring the systemic risk of an individual hedge fund by using the marginal expected shortfall (MES), we find evidence for a positive and statistically significant relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns. The risk-adjusted return of a hedge fund portfolio with a high systemic risk is 0.64% per month higher than for one with a low systemic risk during 1994–2012, while negative performance is observed during crisis periods. The relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns holds for both live and defunct funds. Moreover, the relation holds even after controlling for a large set of fund characteristics. Hence, systemic risk is a powerful determinant of cross-sectional variations in hedge fund returns. Our results imply that the positive relation between hedge fund returns and systemic risk is due to compensation for the realized losses during systemic events. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cross-section of expected returns; Hedge fund; Systemic risk,,"In, F.; Department of Accounting Finance and Economics, Australia; email: f.in@griffth.edu.au",,Elsevier B.V.,09275398,,JEFIE,,English,J.

First, what is the raison d'être of open global markets? Second, is it possible to foster open markets without an international governance structure supervising them? Post-crisis regulatory reform presents an acute paradox. While the content of international financial regulation is changing rapidly, the reform of governance structures is painfully slow. There is no formal governance structure dealing with cross-border supervision of global financial institutions. In addition, there is no crystallized institutional capacity at the international level dealing with cross-border crises and the resolution of global institutions. Other areas of concern are the global supervision of systemic risk and the absence of a reliable finance research watchdog dealing with the production of regulatory standards. This article outlines an international governance framework to deal effectively with these concerns. The adoption of the proposed plan would lead to breaking down the territorial link in the supervision of large financial institutions and of systemic risk, without causing intolerable loss of sovereignty. In addition, the proposed structure is premised on a set of explicit values. These would provide a strong signal to global markets that they need to shift their focus from speculation to development goals. © 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,"Avgouleas, E.; School of Law, United Kingdom",,,17585880,,,,English,Global Policy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880341867,scopus

Focus on Bisphosphonates (BPs) and Bisphosphonates Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (B-ONJ), are an important class of drugs that are useful in the treatment of certain metabolic and oncologic diseases of the skeletal system. Their efficacy in the treatment and palliative care of patient with these diseases is indisputable, but avascular osteonecrosis of the jaws (B-ONJ) has recently been reported as an adverse effect of intravenous BP therapy and with prolonged therapy with oral BPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the most recent scientific literature on B-ONJ in an attempt to characterize this adverse event from an epidemiological point of view and to elaborate guidelines for its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. RESULTS. B-ONJ usually arises in the mandible, in most cases at the level of mylohyoid line; involvement of the upper jaw is less common. It normally occurs after a dental extraction or other types of oral surgery, but it can also develop spontaneously. In cases of the latter type, systemic risk factors (e.g., comorbidities, concomitant therapies), or local pathological/anatomical conditions of the oral cavity play an important role. For patients without identified risk factors, intravenous BP therapy is associated with an estimated incidence of B-ONJ between 0.8 and 1.15%; figures may be as high as 9.1% if these patients undergo dentoalveolar surgery. In patients treated with oral BF, the incidence rate ranges from 0.01 to 0.04% and increases to 0.09%-0.34% after extractions. None of the treatments currentIy used to treat B-ONJ are completely effective and predictable, so prevention is essential for patients receiving BPs. Oral and dental risk factors should be eliminated before BP therapy begins, and this requires close collaboration by the patient's physician and dentist. After BP therapy has been started, there are relative contraindications to dentoalveolar surgery, and only unavoidable procedures should be performed. If B-ONJ develops, the best clinical results are achieved with combined treatment that includes antibiotics, antiseptic mouthwashes, surgical removal of necrotic bone, surgical debridement, biostimulation with low-level laser therapy and ozone-therapy. CONCLUSIONS. B-ONJ is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of BP therapy. It can produce significant morbidity and severely diminish the quality of life. The prognosis appears poor even when appropriate treatment is provided. Since the first cases of B-ONJ have been reported, considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease and its risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, therapy, and management of the complications.",Adverse effects; Bisphosphonates; Oral pathology; Osteonecrosis; Prevention,antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; mouthwash; debridement; dental surgery; dentist; drug efficacy; human; jaw osteonecrosis; palliative therapy; pathogenesis; physician; quality of life; review; risk factor; tooth extraction,"Annibali, S.; Dipartimento di Scienze Odontostomatologiche, via Caserta 6, 00161 Roma, Italy; email: susanna.annibali@uniromal.it",,,00118524,,,,Italian,Dent.

VaR is the basis of Basel II, and all three approaches are proposed in Basel III. This paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we prove that these three rules provide an incentive to increase the probability of catastrophic financial institution failure. Collectively, these rules provide an incentive to increase (not decrease) systemic risk. Second, we argue that an unintended consequence of the Basel II VaR capital adequacy rules was the 2007 credit crisis. Third, we argue that to reduce systemic risk, a new capital adequacy rule is needed.

This crisis started from the US and consequently, it was expanded to all economies of the world due to the systemic risk that globalization has induced to the developed and dependent nations. Thus, this European debt crisis is a crisis of capitalism. Chapter Two analyses different factors that may explain the changes in firms’ performance after privatization in Europe.

The interconnection is a key contributing factor to the past worldwide financial crisis. A default bank may cause its creditors to default, and the risk may be further propagated to up-stream institutes. We study how the mechanism of default liquidation affects the total wealth of the financial system and curbs the risk contagion. We formulate this problem as a nonlinear optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and propose an optimal liquidation policy to minimize the system's loss without changing the partition of default and non-default banks. We show that the optimization problem resembles a Markov decision problem (MDP) and therefore we can apply the direct-comparison based optimization approach to solve this problem. We derive an iteration algorithm which combines both the policy iteration and the gradient based approach. Our work provides a new direction in curbing the risk contagion in financial networks; and it illustrates the advantages of the direct-comparison based approach, which originated in the field of discrete event dynamic system, in nonlinear optimization problems. © 2017",Direct-comparison based optimization; discrete event systems; financial network; Markov decision problems; policy iteration; risk contagion,Discrete event simulation; Iterative methods; Nonlinear programming; Discrete event dynamic systems; Equilibrium constraint; Financial networks; Markov decision problem; Non-linear optimization problems; Optimization approach; Optimization problems; Policy iteration; Finance,,,Elsevier B.V.,24058963,,,,English,IFAC-PapersOnLine,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031771621,scopus

We deal first with business and then government. We conclude that government manages risks and that governmental value creation is distinctively concerned with stability. Hence, to make government work better, risk management ought to be central to the practice of public finance, public policy, and public administration. Understanding the importance of stability is potentially of even greater importance to those who research and teach public policy and administration. Indeed, we propose that the elaboration of a general risk assessment model explaining, among other things, government’s systemic inclination to stability, would take our field a long towards integration with mainstream positive social science and, therefore, holds out the prospect of considerable interdisciplinary consilience, although at this time we can do no more than suggest the contours of such a model. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",government spending and taxing; mechanism; performance; Process; public management; risk; sustainability; systemic risk,,"Thompson, F.; Willamette University Center for Governance and Public Policy Research, United States",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,14719037,,,,English,Public Manage.

Global 4C offers a financial reward for mitigation and aims to internalise a Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) into the economy. Carbon taxes (i.e. carbon prices) are essential for internalising the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), however a SCC-RCC duality is inferred with an epistemological method and is supported with a new hypothesis, called the Holistic Market Hypothesis. Based on the inferred SCC-RCC duality, a system of complementary market pricing is proposed as an effective response to emerging climate systemic risk and fat-tailed probability distributions for the Earth's climate sensitivity. The recommended policy instrument is a currency, called Complementary Currencies for Climate Change (4C). 4C should be priced in foreign exchange currency markets (Forex) to mirror the RCC and to incentivise a spectrum of mitigation services, including clean renewable energy and carbon sequestration. A public broadcast message for climate systemic risk should be made each year, in the form of a ‘100-year advance 4C price alert’, which is an assurance of reward prices for carbon mitigation (i.e. the 4C exchange rate) under a Carbon Exchange Standard (CES).

We then extend the model to account for a possible strategic response, where financial firms adapt to the regulatory regime. Using empirical game-Theoretic analysis, we derive equilibria with and without regulation.

It is essential to understand banker agency and the institutional and structural contexts which shaped such agency. Bankers experienced variegated patters of constraint and opportunity. At one level institutional theories that emphasise institutional constraint cannot easily account for the authority and agency enjoyed by key bankers. On the other hand, bankers were heavily influenced by institutional change in the shape of market 'liberalisation', which produced intense levels of competition and pressures to achieve higher profit returns: an exacting form of market discipline. Bankers and financiers in the US and UK modified institutions and revolutionised the banking industry prior to the 2007-8 crisis. These agents were however heavily constrained and eventually overwhelmed by institutional pressures and wider structural forces that encouraged high-risk leveraged trading and which generated systemic risk. To account for this, institutional theory needs to incorporate a broader canvas of conditioning contexts, particularly the impact of structural or systemic forces on agents and the way in which these are actualised as a form of 'ecosystem power'. © 2014 Political Studies Association.",Banking; Financial crisis; Historical institutionalism; Systemic risk,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,13691481,,,,English,Br.

The paper posits and demonstrates that due to the inherent structure of CCT as S-o-S, users of public CCT are at a higher risk of unlawful intrusion than users of non-CCT systems. At the same time, the flexibility and the agility of CCT S-o-S provide advantages relative to most non-CCT S-o-S. The need is for the CCT community to employ these advantages as an integral part of its cyber security strategy. Our analysis builds on the following theory and methodology: we consider CCT and its users as complex interconnected hardware and software subsystems that interact as S-o-S through shared states, resources, and subsystems, which are connected in series (rather than in parallel, as is the case for most non-CCT systems); exploiting the serial connectivity of CCT S-o-S, we use fault-tree analysis to demonstrate the resulting unreliability of CCT S-o-S; building on the published literature, we incorporate Pareto-optimal frontiers to compare the risks faced by security-conscious users of CCT (e.g., large corporations) versus those faced by cost-conscious users (e.g., small or startup companies); and we show that users of CCT as S-o-S are at a higher risk than users of non-CCT systems for certain assumptions and types of cyber attacks. The paper is structured as follows: Part A outlines the characteristics of CCT S-o-S, addresses the inherent vulnerability of CCT S-o-S to cyber intrusion and attack, and provides a brief literature review; Part B offers a rationale for modeling CCT as interconnected and interdependent S-o-S; Part C demonstrates, through the use of fault-tree analysis, the higher risk faced by CCT and its users as complex S-o-S; Part D presents an economic analysis of the security of CCT as S-o-S; and Part E offers conclusions and lessons learned. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Systems of systems, cloud computing, risk to cloud users",Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer crime; Economic analysis; Fault tree analysis; Network security; Pareto principle; Risk perception; System of systems; Cloud computing technologies; Complex interconnected systems; Cyber intrusion; Hardware and software; Literature reviews; Pareto-optimal frontiers; Start-up companies; Systems of systems; Risk assessment,"Haimes, Y.Y.; Center for Risk Management of Engineering Systems, United States; email: yyh4f@virginia.edu",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,10981241,,,,English,Syst.

Design/methodology/approach: Considering several performance variables, this analysis compares the benefits of diversification across different bank types relative to margin income and fee income. Further, regression analysis considers bank risk and revenue concentration. Findings: This paper documents that fee-based income is riskier than margin income but offers diversification benefits to bank shareholders. While improving bank risk-return tradeoff, these benefits are of second order importance compared to the large negative impact of poor asset quality on shareholder returns. Practical implications: These results have implications for all stakeholders in Australian banks. The results suggest that shareholders of banks will benefit from increased bank exposure to non-interest income via diversification. From a regulatory perspective, diversification reduces the possibility of systemic risk, but caution must be offered with respect to banks pursuing absolute returns rather than monitoring risk-return trade-offs, and so exploiting the benefits of the implied guarantee offered by ""too big to fail"" However, shareholders should also monitor bank exposure to non interest income to ensure that they do not become over-exposed to the point where the volatility effect outweighs the diversification benefits. Originality/value: The results of this study suggest that Australian regulators should consider requiring increased disclosure of the composition of bank non-interest income. Such disclosure would aid in understanding the changing nature of banking in Australia. Given the recent sub-prime crisis in the USA and the role played by fee based income sourced from securitization, increased disclosure of the nature of bank non interest income is now of global importance. This disclosure is particularly germane within the context of the implementation of Basle II, with its increased emphasis upon market discipline, given that Stiroh found increased disclosure in this area is accompanied by improved market pricing for risk. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Australia; Banks; Diversification; Income; Risk management,,"Williams, B.; School of Business, , Robina, Australia; email: Barry_Williams@bond.edu.au",,,17439132,,,,English,Int.

A recent historical retrospect is used to discuss the evolution of events before the crisis. The global uncertainty had increased the price of gold and the U.S. debts and deficits had caused a depreciation of the dollar, which with the help of speculators had heightened the price of oil until the Fall of 2014 and had created a commodity bubble. The deregulation in financial markets and institutions and the easy money policy had increased lending, corruption, speculation, prices in financial and real assets (even in food) and had caused an enormous bubble, which some people (the world planners) burst in 2008 and created the worst financial crisis, followed by the latest most severe recession in modern economic history. The moral and political crisis in the western free-market economies led them in deep recessions, enormous unemployment, annihilation of their wealth, complete distrust for the financial markets, a new cold war, and an elevation of terrorism. A theoretical model is used to describe the sequence of events first and to measure the benefits (gains) and costs (losses) to society by considering some objective macroeconomic variables and their deviations from the target ones. Then, we determine the factors affecting the objective variables of the economy (unemployment, prices, and real GDP) by taking into consideration policy variables (i.e., federal funds rate, taxes, and government spending). Nations and people face an absolutely uncertain future and the powerless world governments and regulators are just inactively watching the events that we are all part and responsible for this interdependent and complex world, which we created for the future generations. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We show that the extent to which borrowers can ward off an individual run depends on whether it has sufficient liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation capacity. These determinants depend on the borrower's (endogenous) balance sheet and on (exogenous) fundamentals. Systemic runs are possible if shocks to the valuation of collateral held by outside investors are sufficiently strong and uniform, and if the system as a whole is exposed to high short-term funding risk.

The analysis focuses upon Margin Call (2011) and Cosmopolis (2012), two films that draw from the genre commonly referred to as ‘the thriller’. Both films are fictional and exhibit the interplay between systemic risk, the revision of historical conventions of the thriller, and financial crisis. Specifically, the narratives build their central dramatic tensions around representations of the persistent challenge to locate, quarantine, and coordinate networked responses against systemic risk, a challenge which comes to symbolise the fundamental struggle of a global financial culture. Within these films, systemic risk is represented through a new set of semiotic codes involving technology and mathematics, which work to join near-automated financial industries of late-stage capitalism with an appearance of human relevancy. When positioned against the rhetorical specifics of U.S. congressional hearings and news media reports about the crisis, a dynamic pattern about ‘thrills’ and risk begins to emerge wherein the films’ representational fields and the adopted structures of the allegedly nonfictional, expert language form a reciprocal relation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Economic criticism; Film; Genre; Great recession; Risk; Thriller,,"Clavin, K.; Department of English, United States; email: kclavin@rwu.edu",,Routledge,0950236X,,,,English,Textual Pract.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014494385,scopus

Nevertheless, in credit insurance, the impact of the systemic risk is even more important and can lead to major losses during a crisis. Because of this, the insurer surveils and manages policies almost continuously. The management actions it takes limit the consequences of a downturning cycle. However, the traditional modeling of economic capital does not take into account this important feature of credit insurance. This paper proposes a model aiming to estimate future losses of a credit insurance portfolio, while taking into account the insurer’s management actions. The model considers the capacity of the credit insurer to take on less risk in the case of a cycle downturn, but also the inverse, in the case of a cycle upturn; so, losses are predicted with a more dynamic perspective.

We compute the index for 10 European countries, exploiting the information incorporated in the CDS premia of 44 large banks over the period January 2007-September 2010. In this way, we provide a market based measure of the liability incurred by the Governments, due to the implicit bail-out guarantees they provide to the financial sector. We find that during the financial crisis the systemic component of the default risk in the banking sector has significantly increased in all countries, with the exception of Germany and the Netherlands. As a consequence, the Governments' liability implicit in the bail out guarantee amounts to a quite relevant share of GDP in several countries: it is huge for Ireland, lower but still important for the other PIIGS (Italy is the least affected within this group) and for the UK. Finally, our estimate is very close to the overall amount of money already committed in the rescue plans adopted in Europe between October 2008 and March 2010, despite strong cross-country differences: in particular, Germany and Ireland seem to have committed an amount of resources much larger than needed; to the contrary, the Italian Government has committed much less than it should. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Financial crisis; Government budget; Systemic risk,,"Baglioni, A.; Catholic University of Milan, Largo Gemelli, n. 1, 20123 Milano, Italy; email: angelo.baglioni@unicatt.it",,Elsevier Ltd,02615606,,,,English,J.

As a result, heavy-handed measures have been introduced, such as those in the Dodd–Frank Act and the European market infrastructure regulation, which mandate central counterparty clearing for OTC credit derivatives. The deployment of central counterparties (CCPs) is by no means a panacea for global financial stability. Drawing on the ongoing debate about the benefits of CCPs, this paper considers them through the lens of the Legal Theory of Finance proposed by Katharina Pistor. This leads to a number of observations: firstly, CCPs lack sufficient tools to adjust for the materialisation of unexpected circumstances, not least because of precarious state-contingent collateral calls. Moreover, the hierarchy of the financial system highlights a hierarchy with respect to the vindication of property rights in times of crisis. This causes one to consider financial stability as a public good and to argue in favour of stronger social responsibility in financial markets. Major financial players ought to be required to have more ‘skin in the game’. CCPs therefore lend themselves as a focal point for regulatory measures. © 2016, T.M.C.

As a result, some assets will have to be liquidated and sold to outsiders at firesale prices, giving rise to a potentially high losses given default (LGDs) for creditors of failed institutions. This study analyzes the consequences of this firesale mechanism for systemic risk. Our findings suggest that systemic risk is likely to be heavily underestimated when the potential for firesales, and thereby the endogenous nature of LGDs, is not taken into account. The magnitude of the negative bias increases with asset return correlations, banks’ return variability, the degree of asset specificity of bank loans and the degree of concentration in the banking sector. The analysis suggests that time-varying liquidity requirements are an effective way to reduce the potential for firesales and thereby lower systemic risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Financial stability; Firesales; Systemic risk,,"IJtsma, P.; University of Groningen, P.O.

A composition effect is a change in the market risk of a sector that is caused not by a direct change in that sector but by a change in another sector that affects the composition of the stock market. In the paper we investigate the pre and during crisis market risk of the industrial, banking and utilities sectors. Amongst other results, we find a positive relationship across the G12 countries between the increase in the market risk of industrials during the crisis and both the pre-crisis market risk of the banking sector and the scale of the systemic crisis in a country. The six G12 countries that experienced a major systematic banking crisis are amongst the seven countries with the largest increases in the market risk for industrials. Results drawn from our detailed analysis using US data are consistent with these findings. Finally, we show how the results add to our understanding of the linkages between the financial and real sector and conclude that composition effects of the financial crisis could have a significant chilling effect on investment in industrials, which is in addition to the effect of other linkages already documented. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Banking sector; Financial crisis; G01; G1; G15; Industrials; Market risk; Systemic risk; Utilities,,"Zalewska, A.; School of Management, United Kingdom; email: a.zalewska@bath.ac.uk",,Elsevier Inc.,10575219,,,,English,Int.

For the first time, systemic risk was caused by a lack of liquidity in the marketplace. To deal with this newly revealed systemic risk, researchers have developed various quantitative indicators. Despite successful empirical results, these indicators are mainly empirically based and are not capable of differentiating liquidity risk from other sources of risk, such as market and credit risks. In this article, the authors develop a liquidity index to measure the systemic risk caused by liquidity distress in the financial market. The index is based on a parsimonious model that has a semiclosedform solution to compute a discount due to illiquidity. The model can be used to distinguish liquidity default from economic default (solvency). The authors construct their liquidity index using stocks in Standard & Poor's 1500 financial sector index over the January 1996-December 2013 period. This liquidity index then can be used for various systemic risk analyses. They discover that there is large variation among banks in their liquidity health, that large banks suffer more liquidity discounts than smaller banks, but only a portion of banks suffered severely during the crisis. Using measured liquidity discounts, the authors relate their index to several financial variables used to represent financial distress or economic conditions in the academic literature. © 2015 Institutional Investor LLC.",,,,,"Institutional Investor, Inc",10598596,,,,English,J.

As monetary circuit theory shows, banks are special, insofar as they can grant loans without the need to dispose of preexistent bank deposits. When the loans-generate-deposits causal chain occurs on the factor market, for firms to pay the wage bill, the money-output relation is not affected by banks' intermediation. This relation is modified when banks exploit the loans-generate-deposits mechanism for any financial market transactions, whether for their clients or for their own sake. Financial liberalization and deregulation pushed banks to compete with nonbank financial institutions, for them to retain their market share, reducing both their markup on monetary policy rates of interest and the credit standard they used to apply to firms as well as households. In that process, banks have, therefore, become ""financial supermarkets,"" engaged first and foremost in investment banking, which is a misnomer, because, in fact, it has nothing to do with investment properly speaking: it is speculation on ""global"" financial markets, which are indeed far from providing any support to productive investment within the economic system. © 2011, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",bank money; financial crisis; payment systems; systemic risk,,"Rossi, S.; University of FribourgSwitzerland",,Routledge,15580970,,,,English,Int.

Indeed, due to the special structure of the balance sheet of a bank and to the interconnections with other institutions of the financial system, the standard pricing formulas do not apply and their use can imply severe mispricing. The pricing of credit derivatives written on a single bank name requires a joint analysis of the risks of all banks directly or indirectly interconnected with the bank of interest. Each name cannot be priced in isolation, but the banking system must be treated as a whole. It is necessary to analyze the contagion of losses among banks, especially the equilibrium of joint defaults and recovery rates at liquidation time.

In cascade models of systemic risk, this skeleton acts as the medium through which financial contagion is propagated. It has been observed in real networks that such counterparty relationships exhibit negative assortativity, meaning that a bank’s counterparties are more likely to have unlike characteristics. This paper introduces and studies a general class of random graphs called the assortative configuration model, parameterized by an arbitrary node-type distribution P and edge-type distribution Q. The first main result is a law of large numbers that says the empirical edge-type distributions converge in probability to Q as the number of nodes N goes to infinity. The second main result is a formula for the large N asymptotic probability distribution of general graphical objects called configurations. This formula exhibits a key property called locally tree-like that in simpler models is known to imply strong results of percolation theory on the size of large connected clusters. Thus this paper provides the essential foundations needed to prove rigorous percolation bounds and cascade mappings in assortative networks. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2017.",Assortativity; Banking network; Configuration graph; Laplace method; Large graph asymptotics; Locally tree-like; Percolation theory; Random graph simulation; Skeleton; Systemic risk,,"Hurd, T.R.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Canada; email: hurdt@mcmaster.ca",,Springer New York LLC,10695265,,,,English,Fields Inst.

The model is tested with various parameter settings in Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses yield the following key results: first, in the short term, all the support measures improve systemic stability. Second, in the longer run, there are settings which mitigate the systemic crisis and settings which contribute to systemic breakdown. Finally, there are differences among the effects of the different types of support measures.

County level data are available in longer time series, however. The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to make full use of the information inherent in each of these data sets. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a novel application of statistical tools for using farm and county level yield data to generate farm level yield densities that explicitly incorporate within county yield heterogeneity while accounting for systemic risk and other spatial or intertemporal correlations among farms within the county. Findings – The empirical analysis shows that current approaches used by the Risk Management Agency to individualize premiums for a farm result in substantial mispricing of crop insurance premiums because they do not adequately capture farm yield variability and yield correlations between farms. The new premium setting method is empirically shown to substantially reduce government subsidies for crop insurance premiums. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates how to extract more information from available data when setting crop insurance premiums, which allows the government to more closely tailor premiums to the farm than do current approaches. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Agriculture; Copulas; Corn; Crop yield; Crops; Federal crop insurance; Insurance premiums; Monte Carlo simulation; Multivariate density functions; Soybeans; United States of America,,"Cooper, J.; Department of Market and Trade Economics, United States; email: jcooper@ers.usda.gov",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,00021466,,,,English,Agric.

We observe that a variety of natural systems, including colonies of ants and bees and perhaps even neurons in the human brain, make decentralized decisions using common processes involving information search with positive feedback and consensus choice through quorum sensing. We model this process with an urn scheme that runs until hitting a threshold, and we characterize an inherent tradeoff between the speed and the accuracy of a decision. The proposed common mechanism provides a robust and effective means by which a decentralized system can navigate the speed-accuracy tradeoff and make reasonably good, quick decisions in a variety of environments. Additionally, consensus choice exhibits systemic risk aversion even while individuals are idiosyncratically risk-neutral. This too is adaptive. The model illustrates how natural systems make decentralized decisions, illuminating a mechanism that engineers of social and artificial systems could imitate. 2015 © The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.",,Decision making; Feedback; Artificial systems; Common process; Decentralized decision making; Decentralized system; Information search; Natural systems; Quorum-sensing; Social systems; Search engines,"Hagmann, D.; Department of Social and Decision Sciences, 5000 Forbes Avenue, United States; email: hagmann@cmu.edu",,American Association for the Advancement of Science,23752548,,,,English,Sci.

This study examined 15-year outcomes among women younger than 40 years treated with breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation therapy (BCT) compared with those treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM).Methods and Materials: Women aged 20 to 39 years with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2003 were identified in a population-based database. Primary outcomes of breast cancerespecific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes of local relapseefree survival (LRFS), locoregional relapseefree survival (LRRFS), and distant relapseefree survival (DRFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between BCT and MRM cohorts using logrank tests. A planned subgroup analysis was performed on patients considered ideal for BCT (ie, T1N0, negative margins and no extensive ductal carcinoma in situ) and in whom local therapy may have the largest impact on survival because of low systemic risk.Results: 965 patients were identified; 616 had BCT and 349 had MRM. The median follow-up time was 14.4 years (range, 8.4-23.3 years). Overall, 15-year rates of BCSS (76.0% vs 74.1%, P=.62), OS (74.2% vs 73.0%, P=.75), LRFS (85.4% vs 86.5%, P=.95), LRRFS (82.2% vs 81.6%, P=.61), and DRFS (74.4% vs 71.6%, P=.40) were similar between the BCT and MRM cohorts. In the ideal for BCT subgroup, there were 219 BCT and 67 MRM patients with a median follow-up time of 15.5 years. The 15-year BCSS (86.1% vs 82.9%, P=.57), OS (82.6% vs 82.9%, P=.89), LRFS (86.2% vs 84.2%, P=.50), LRRFS (83.1% vs 78.3%, P=.24), and DRFS (84.8% vs 79.1%, P=.17) were similar in the BCT and MRM cohorts.Conclusions: This population-based analysis with long-term follow-up confirmed that women younger than 40 years treated with BCT had similar 15-year outcomes compared with MRM.

The clinical picture is typically characterized by very painful skin lesions and ulcerations following calcification and occlusion of small cutaneous arterioles. CUA is life-threatening due to infections and concomitant cardiovascular diseases. Methods: We performed a literature search for the terms calciphylaxis and calcific uremic arteriolopathy and summarized current state-of-the-art knowledge about pathophysiology, clinical picture, course of the disease, as well as treatment options. We have filled out the literature data with our personal treatment experiences. Results: A combination of various local and systemic risk factors are necessary to cause the development of calciphylaxis. This pathophysiological cascade is still incompletely understood. Patients with advanced CKD and dialysis patients are especially at risk to develop CUA. Regarding therapy, no randomized prospective trials are available, and treatment is rather based on pathophysiological considerations as well as on evidence derived from case reports or case series. Therapy focuses on optimized dialysis treatment, control of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder parameters, experimental anticalcification strategies and wound care. Conclusion: Facing the still deleterious outcome of patients with calciphylaxis, further studies on prophylaxis as well as treatment are urgently needed. Current treatment strategies may help ameliorate the course of the disease in some patients. However, it is still unclear if they are able to decrease mortality. © 2011 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.",Calcific uremic arteriolopathy; Calcification; Calciphylaxis; Chronic kidney disease; Vascular disease,anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; bisphosphonic acid derivative; cinacalcet; heparin; mineral; osteocalcin; sodium thiosulfate; steroid; vitamin K group; warfarin; artery calcification; article; bone disease; calcinosis; chronic kidney disease; clinical feature; dialysis; disease control; disease course; disease severity; human; hyperbaric oxygen; parathyroidectomy; pathophysiology; risk assessment; risk factor; surgical wound; wound care; Arterioles; Calcinosis; Calciphylaxis; Chelating Agents; Chronic Disease; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Skin; Thiosulfates,"Brandenburg, V.

Systemic risk is defined as the propensity of a financial institution to be undercapitalised when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalised. By the law of large numbers, traditional lines of insurance with idiosyncratic non-catastrophic risks cannot be systemic. On the contrary, undiversified insurers specialised in activities whose insured risks are highly correlated with GDP are systemic. In the life insurance sector, some contractual clauses such as unhedged minimum guarantees and free options to surrender raise the chance of systemic relevance. On the contrary, life insurers satisfying the classic solvency capital requirements contribute to the liquidity of financial markets thanks to the long-termist approach of their portfolio management. Finally, using historical data in the U.S. on the contribution of different sectors to the aggregate volatility of the economy, we show that investment banking is almost twice as volatile as aggregate GDP, while insurance is one fifth as volatile as aggregate GDP. The insurance sector thus appears to be a stabilising force of the economy. © 2016 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.",,,"Bobtcheff, C.; Toulouse School of Economics, 21 allée de Brienne, France",,Palgrave Macmillan,1554964X,,,,English,GENEVA Risk Insur.

Based on China's emission abatement target, this paper first analyzes enterprises' emission reduction pathways in practical production processes, and then develops a framework to derive the magnitude of investment required in each pathway in order to achieve the designated target at the minimal cost. Under the framework, it is found that in the absence of policy guidance, individual enterprises' emission reduction investments deviate from the optimal level. To correct the distortion, an alternative option is provided. Meanwhile, to ensure achievement of the emission reduction target, a stochastic model is introduced to measure the uncertainty arising from emission abatement investment. The results show that an appropriate emission abatement ratio can reduce 'the systemic risk' of emission abatement. Finally, a simulation is given to demonstrate the results derived from the stochastic model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Emission abatement; Investment; Uncertainty,Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Emission abatement; Emission reduction; Environmentally sustainable development; Minimal cost; Optimal investments; Optimal level; Per unit; Policy guidance; Practical production; Uncertainty; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Economics; Global warming; Industry; Investments; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Stochastic models; carbon emission; computer simulation; Gross Domestic Product; investment; numerical model; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; China,"Wang, M.; Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, , Beijing 100190, China; email: mxwang@amss.ac.cn",,,03014215,,ENPYA,,English,Energy Policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855975982,scopus

So in this paper we mainly focus on modeling and analysing the financial contagion in a system where a large number of financial institutions are randomly connected by the direct balance sheets linkages own to the lending or borrowing relationships. We propose a simple contagion algorithm to study the effect of several determinants, such as the topology of financial network, exposure ratio, leverage ratio, and the liquidation ratio. One of our finding is that the financial contagion is weaker as the growth of connectivity of network, so a financial system with a higher connectivity is more stability or robustness; we also find that the exposure ratio increases the risk of financial contagion, but both the leverage ratio and liquidation ratio has a negative relationship on financial contagion.",Contagion algorithm; Financial contagion; Financial stability; Financial system; Random network; Systemic risk,Information systems; Management information systems; System stability; Financial contagions; Financial stability; Financial system; Random network; Systemic risks; Finance,,,City University of Hong Kong Press,,9789624423938,,,English,"Int.

Contrarily to the common belief that margining always reduces default risk, we find that there exist situations in which margining increases default risk, reduces aggregate derivatives' trading volume, and has an ambiguous effect on welfare in the banking sector.

Given increased interconnections around the globe there is general agreement that in recent time financial system has become much more vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The main channels of transmission are trade and financial linkages among nations. The former are more traditional for developing countries while the latter-for developed markets. The appetite of global investors to risk, the level of uncertainty and information asymmetry in the global financial market are also important factors which can influence the magnitude of shock transmission. The article gives an overview of different methods to calculate the risks of financial shock transmission across countries including correlation and volatility analysis, contingent claims analysis, econometric models with a global factor and different types of VAR (VEC). Using the method of forecast error variance decomposition from a vector auto regression, first proposed by F. Diebold and K. Yilmaz to analyze stock markets interconnectedness, the author quantifies directions of financial shock spillovers in equity, government bond and real estate markets. This methodology was applied to 10 countries. It was found that US, Germany and France are the major transmitters of shocks to other countries. The results point to a slight difference in the magnitude of transmission in different sectors: stock markets tend to suffer more from spillover effects while government bond markets are more sensitive to internal factors of instability. The article also discusses various approaches to global systemic risk modeling which is a new area of research in recent time. Regulatory reforms which began in the post-crisis period are considered to be a necessary condition to decrease the intensity of financial shocks transmission.

Governments increasingly seek to maximise the benefits of globalisation for national populations by eliminating unnecessary regulatory divergences and barriers, and ensuring greater co-ordination of regulatory objectives. At the same time, intensification of global challenges, such as those pertaining to systemic risks (financial markets), the environment (air or water pollution), and human health and safety, is leading to growing regulatory co-operation efforts as a key component of risk management strategies across borders. Regulatory co-operation is not a new topic (OECD, 1994). However, renewed attention has been paid to its importance since the economic crisis began in 2008. Perceived regulatory failures related to poor articulation of regulation across borders, limited enforcement of rules and regulatory capture have raised questions regarding the role of the state as a regulator and, specifically, how and where it should intervene to achieve key policy objectives in an increasingly globalised world. The gains that can be achieved through greater co-ordination of rules and their application across jurisdictions remain largely untapped and underanalysed. Consensus has grown among countries over the years on the elements of ""good"" regulation at domestic level, culminating in 2012 with Council's approval of the Recommendation on Regulatory Policy and Governance. By contrast, the potential of international regulatory cooperation (IRC) to transfer good regulatory practices, to make markets function better, to level the playing field, to reduce costs, to manage global goods and risks better and to generate substantial benefits for business and the public has not been explored systematically. Despite its potential and the fact that the OECD and others have accumulated a large body of experience in fostering regulatory co-operation in a number of specific areas, including environment, competition, consumer protection and tax, this vast body of (mostly qualitative) knowledge has yet to be synthesised and analysed to provide useful lessons. This report is a unique attempt to gather in a synthetic but systematic manner, the knowledge and evidence available to date on IRC. This report reviews the available evidence on IRC drawn from a literature review, a survey to OECD countries and case studies of specific IRC experiences and lays the foundation for further work on IRC. Chapter 1 systematically defines and documents a wide range of IRC mechanisms and highlights a number of prevailing trends in the internationalisation of regulation, laying the foundation for the development of a typology. Chapter 2 reviews the benefits, challenges and costs of IRC and highlights the critical conditions of success, laying the foundations for the development of a checklist to support governments' efforts in identifying adequate forms of IRC in a specific context and in developing and strengthening successful co-operation. The areas where further work is needed are elaborated upon in the conclusion. The review of evidence confirms the increased internationalisation of regulation, which takes place through a wide variety of IRC mechanisms and multiple actors. Today, governments use and combine a broad range of formal and informal, broad and specific IRC mechanisms to achieve their co-operation objectives. In a given policy area, there can be different forms of IRC. The strengthening of IRC is accompanied by a multiplication of state and non-state actors with regulatory powers, i.e. different levels of government and public agencies and private national and international stakeholders. As a result, countries are embedded in webs of regulatory cooperation that go beyond the traditional treaty-based model of international relations, to encompass transgovernmental networks involving multiple actors with sometimes limited oversight or monitoring by the centre of government. To keep pace with the need to regulate across borders, the nature of IRC has changed from complete ""harmonisation"" of regulation (i.e. uniformity of laws) to more flexible options - such as mutual recognition agreements. This shift is partly due to the recognition that frictions generated by regulatory divergences result as much from diverging enforcement and implementation efforts as from differences in the regulations and standards themselves. Consequently, harmonisation of rules will address only one aspect of regulatory divergences. The understanding that regulatory co-operation needs to encompass all phases of the policy cycle is growing and with it the recognition that flexible mechanisms need to be put in place to address implementation challenges and to anticipate forthcoming issues. In this context, soft law and informal co-operation - such as dialogue between regulators and exchange of information - Are becoming more important in promoting regulatory co-operation, generally in support or in anticipation of more binding processes, and as a flexible tool to address emerging global issues. Similarly, the trend is towards the development of supporting international organisations that provide a platform for continuous discussions. Despite growing regulatory co-operation, decision making on IRC remains mainly guided by political considerations and is not informed by a clear understanding of benefits, costs and success factors of the diverse IRC options. In some areas, co-operation has led to obvious successes. Experience accumulated in chemical safety, for example, shows that the use of harmonised approaches and instruments leads to important savings for governments and industries, while allowing greater achievement of public policy objectives. Most cases of successful co-operation have, however, tended to develop in an ad hoc manner, along ""paths of least resistance"", and without following general principles of good regulatory governance. There is no overall and cross-country consensus yet on the language used in relation to IRC, or on the range and definition of the different mechanisms in the hands of policy makers to promote IRC. The quantitative evidence on the benefits and costs of IRC remains scant. Changing language and anecdotal evidence generate uncertainty with regards to the benefits and costs of regulatory co-operation and prevent systematic and rational decision making on IRC. The shortcomings and gaps in policy making related to IRC call for further analytical work and guidance for which the OECD Regulatory Policy Committee is well positioned to provide useful inputs. While most countries acknowledge the importance and potential value of IRC, very few have started considering and mainstreaming issues of international co-operation into their regulatory process. More could be done in support of country efforts to identify the range of existing IRC mechanisms, to assess the benefits, costs and challenges of IRC in specific sectors and situations, and to strengthen IRC following good regulatory policy principles. Similarly, the emergence of new actors with regulatory powers on the international scene has been mostly spontaneous, and has not necessarily been matched with corresponding good regulatory practices. As an example, while transnational private regulation plays a growing role, governments have limited systematic tools at their disposal to evaluate when and under which conditions transnational private regulation might be a preferable regulatory option. Similarly, while international organisations play a growing role in supporting IRC, the extent to which they do so while following good regulatory policy practices is unclear. © OECD 2013.",,,,,Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),,9789264200463; 9789264200463,,,English,Intl.

Despite this, many laboratories do not perform nerve conduction studies (NCS) in patients with a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Furthermore, some labs do not perform needle EMG or at least do not examine some of the higher risk muscle groups in patients on anticoagulant or even antiplatelet therapy. In rare cases, EMG examination may also be complicated by leakage, transmission of infectious diseases, pneumothorax, compartment syndrome, or a peripheral nerve lesion. The aim of this study was to summarize current knowledge and recommendations related to these limitations and complications of EMG examination. According to published studies, common as well as repetitive electrical peripheral nerve stimulation can be performed in patients with pacemaker/defibrillator. Stimulation in close proximity to pacemaker/defibrillator should be avoided to prevent electromagnetic interference with their function. No increased systemic risk of clinically significant intramuscular haemorrhage was found in patients on an anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. Intramuscular hematomas resulting from needle EMG are usually very small (several millimetres) and clinically asymptomatic. Symptomatic and asymptomatic haemorrhages following needle EMG can occur without any relation to anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy. However, they are generally rare and needle EMG is considered to be a safe diagnostic tool. In patients taking anticoagulation medication, thrombotic riskof discontinuing anticoagulation prior to EMG outweighs the risks associated with needle examination while on anticoagulation. All other EMG complications listed above are very rare but relevant. Therefore, it should always be carefully considered whether EMG examination is indicated. General technical and hygienic-epidemiological recommendations for EMG examination should be strictly followed to minimise the incidence of complications.",Anticoagulant agents; Antiplatelet agents; Artificial pacemaker; Electric stimulation; Electromyography; Haemorrhage; Implantable defibrillators; Infection; Pneumothorax; Warfarin,anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; anticoagulant therapy; complication; defibrillator pacemaker; diagnosis; electromyography; human; muscle bleeding; muscle hematoma; needle electromyography; nerve conduction velocity test; nerve stimulation; Review; risk benefit analysis; treatment contraindication,"Vlčková, E.; Neurologická Klinika, Jihlavská 20, Czech Republic; email: evlckova@email.cz",,Czech Medical Association J.E.

This study investigates the contribution of US and European exchange rate interactions to overall stress in the US financial system from 1992 to 2013. The impacts of these interactions are assessed using a financial stress index that aggregates measures of national and international stresses. There are three main findings for the sample period. First, we find that European influences on US financial stress have increased. Second, observing several structural breaks with changing correlation and Granger causality patterns, we find that the euro and the British pound have contributed varying levels of stress. Third, we find that stress in US markets tends to spill over into European markets, while the reverse influences are of lesser importance. These findings have important implications for supervisors in international markets. Understanding the amplifying or attenuating feedback effects from international connectivity provides valuable insight into the development of macroprudential policies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",financial stress; financial stress index; risk contributions; supervision; systemic risk,,"Gramlich, D.; DHBW–Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State UniversityGermany; email: gramlich@dhbw-heidenheim.de",,Routledge,1351847X,,,,English,Eur.

Method 409 eyes from 268 patients with 10 reliable VFs from the Japanese Archive of Multicentral Databases in Glaucoma (JAMDIG) were investigated. VFs were divided into six sectors (mean total deviation (mTD) s20+, mTD s10-20 and mTD s0-10, >20°, 10-20° and <10° in the superior hemifield, respectively; and mTD i20+, mTD i10-20 and mTD i0-10, >20°, 10-20° and <10° in the inferior hemifield, respectively). The relationship between sectorial progression rate and eight variables (age, mTD at baseline VF, average intraocular pressure (IOP), SD of IOP, systemic hypertension, migraine, family history of glaucoma and smoking status) was investigated. Result The mTD progression rate was -0.21dB/year. Older age was related to progression of mTD s20+, mTD s10-20, mTD i20+ and mTD i10-20. Mean IOP was not related to progression in any VF sector; however, a larger SD of IOP was related to progression of mTD s20+, mTD i0-10, mTD i10-20 and mTD i20+. Smoking status was related to progression in all inferior VF sectors (mTD i0-10, mTD i10-20 and mTD i20+). Conclusions Smoking status is related to glaucomatous VF progression in all sectors of the inferior hemifield. © 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",Glaucoma,"adult; age; aged; Article; deterioration; family history; female; human; Humphrey perimeter; hypertension; intraocular pressure; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; migraine; open angle glaucoma; perimetry; priority journal; smoking; visual field defect; adverse effects; disease course; glaucoma; middle aged; multicenter study (topic); pathophysiology; physiology; risk factor; very elderly; visual field; young adult; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disease Progression; Female; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Migraine Disorders; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Risk Factors; Smoking; Visual Fields; Young Adult","Asaoka, R.; Department of Ophthalmology, 7-3-1 Hongo, Japan; email: rasaoka-tky@umin.ac.jp",,BMJ Publishing Group,00071161,,BJOPA,27941050.0,English,Br.

The analysis of systemic risk is the focus of recent econometric analyses and uses tail event and network based techniques. Here, in this paper we bring tail event and network dynamics together into one context. In order to pursue such joint efforts, we propose a semiparametric measure to estimate systemic interconnectedness across financial institutions based on tail-driven spillover effects in a high dimensional framework. The systemically important institutions are identified conditional to their interconnectedness structure. Methodologically, a variable selection technique in a time series setting is applied in the context of a single-index model for a generalized quantile regression framework. We could thus include more financial institutions into the analysis to measure their tail event interdependencies and, at the same time, be sensitive to non-linear relationships between them. Network analysis, its behaviour and dynamics, allows us to characterize the role of each financial industry group in 2007-2012: the depositories received and transmitted more risk among other groups, the insurers were less affected by the financial crisis. The proposed TENET - Tail Event driven NETwork technique allows us to rank the Systemic Risk Receivers and Systemic Risk Emitters in the US financial market. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A number of firms used derivatives to construct highly leveraged speculative positions, which generated enormous losses that threatened to bankrupt not only the firms themselves but also their creditors and trading partners. Hundreds of billions of dollars in government credit were needed to prevent such losses from cascading throughout the system. AIG was the best-known example, but by no means the only one. Equally troublesome was the fact that the OTC market depended on the financial stability of a dozen or so major dealers. Failure of a dealer would have resulted in the nullification of trillions of dollars worth of contracts and would have exposed derivatives counterparties to sudden risk and loss, exacerbating the cycle of deleveraging and withholding of credit that characterized the crisis. During the crisis, all the major dealers came under stress, and even though derivatives dealing was not generally the direct source of financial weakness, a collapse of the $600 trillion OTC derivatives market was imminent absent federal intervention. The first group of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients included nearly all the large derivatives dealers. The Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) sought to remake the OTC market in the image of the regulated futures exchanges. Crucial reforms include a requirement that swap contracts be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by one or more federal agencies. Clearinghouses require traders to put down cash (called initial margin) at the time they open a contract to cover potential losses, and require subsequent deposits (called maintenance margin) to cover actual losses to the position. The intended effect of margin requirements is to eliminate the possibility that any firm can build up an uncapitalized exposure so large that default would have systemic consequences (again, the AIG situation). The size of a cleared position is limited by the firm's ability to post capital to cover its losses. That capital protects its trading partners and the system as a whole. Swap dealers and major swap participants-firms with substantial derivatives positions-will be subject to margin and capital requirements above and beyond what the clearinghouses mandate. Swaps that are cleared will also be subject to trading on an exchange, or an exchangelike ""swap execution facility,"" regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the case of security-based swaps. All trades will be reported to data repositories, so that regulators will have complete information about all derivatives positions. Data on swap prices and trading volumes will be made public. The Dodd-Frank Act provides exceptions to the clearing and trading requirements for commercial end-users, or firms that use derivatives to hedge the risks of their nonfinancial business operations. Regulators may also provide exemptions for smaller financial institutions. Even trades that are exempt from the clearing and exchange-trading requirements, however, will have to be reported to data repositories or directly to regulators.

Using event study methodol- ogy and allowing systematic risk to change gradually within the event window, this paper provides empirical evidence that securitization has a positive impact on Spanish bank's systematic risk (beta) from the beginning to the end of the event window. Additionally, we assess how much of the beta effect is due to volatility and how much to market cor- relation. The increase in beta is solely due to an increase in banks’ correlations, improving portfolio diversification. The empirical results presented in this paper show important informative implications for the different agents related to banks.

The authors build and empirically utilise the measure of systemic risk, which is based on the traditional CoVaR approach, as proposed by Adrian and Brunenmeier (CoVaR. Staff Report No. 348, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2008 [revised September 2014]; CoVaR. NBER Working Paper No. 17454, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2011; Am Econ Rev 106:1705–1741, 2016), but uses market-based data (instead of the book values) for calculation. The assumptions of this method, among all else are that 1) the aspects of systemic risk which closely relate to financial system stability, for relatively small financial systems, where the banking sector is the main provided of funding and liquidity, may be modelled with banking-sector-based methods; and 2) the stock market is efficient enough to price the risk related to those financial institutions, whose stocks are quoted on the relevant stock exchange. The empirical research is carried on the example of Poland, as in the authors opinion, also following the literature, the two mentioned assumptions hold for this particular country. The paper concludes with ideas for future research, including further development of the proposed method to include institutions other than banks, and a range of other central European countries for which this method is applicable. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Banking sector; CoVaR; Systemic risk; Value at risk,,"Karaś, M.; Department of Financial Investment and Risk Management, Poland; email: marta.karas@ue.wroc.pl",Jajuga K.Orlowski L.T.Staehr K.,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,21987246,9783319548845,,,English,Springer Proc.

In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: eligible as collateral and not eligible, with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisions - which affects their return - and on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model. In a calibration exercise, it is shown how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority to have a preference for a gross system, like TARGET, over a net system, like EURO1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.",Collateral; Contagion; EURO1; European Union; Gross payment system; Intraday liquidity; Net payment system; Payment systems; Systemic risk; TARGET,,"Muoz, F.J.C.; Department of Economics, , 17071 Girona, Spain; email: franciscojose.callado@udg.es",,,1351847X,,,,English,Eur.

A possible conjecture in this context is that individual risk diversification across more numerous counterparties should make also systemic defaults less likely. We show that this view is not always true. In particular, the diversification of credit risk across many borrowers has ambiguous effects on systemic risk in the presence of mechanisms of loss amplifications such as in the presence of potential runs among the short-term lenders of the agents in the network. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Contagion; Financial crisis; Network models; Systemic risk,,"Battiston, S.; ETH ZurichSwitzerland; email: sbattiston@ethz.ch",,,15723089,,,,English,J.

BPs have shown a sure effectiveness in the treatment and in the palliative care of such pathologies; on the other hand, an avascular osteonecrosis of the jaws (B-ONJ = Bisphosphonate OsteoNecrosis of the Jaw) has recently been reported as an adverse effect not only of BP intravenous infusions, but also of their prolonged oral administration. B-ONJ normally follows a dental extraction or other surgical procedure in the oral cavity, but it also can develop spontaneously. In the latter case, some systemic risk factors, such as comorbidities and co-therapies or jaw anatomical conditions, can play a leading role in the onset of this pathologic condition. B-ONJ is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of BP therapy that can gravely affect the patient's quality of life, producing significant morbidity. To date, no therapies are completely effective and predictable in the treatment of B-ONJ, therefore prevention should be strongly promoted by sharing knowledge in the involved medical community.

Beyond the increase in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, in addition to internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors. This further stresses the importance of simple representations of complex data. The present paper focuses on the background and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube. © 2016",Analytical visualization; Interactive visualization; Macroprudential oversight; Risk communication; VisRisk; Visualization,,"Sarlin, P.; Hanken School of Economic, Arkadiagatan 22, Finland; email: peter@risklab.fi",,Elsevier B.V.,15723089,,,,English,J.

To study how biomechanical forces regulate EC redox homeostasis, an important pathogenic factor in atherogenesis, we have cultured human ECs under 2 prototypic arterial shear stress waveforms, ""atheroprone"" and ""atheroprotective, "" which were derived from 2 distinct vascular regions in vivo that are typically ""susceptible"" or ""resistant"" to atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that atheroprotective flow decreases EC intracellular redox level and protects ECs against oxidative stress-induced injury. To identify the molecular mechanisms that control this cellular response, we examined several major oxidative/antioxidative pathways and found that atheroprotective flow upregulated certain antioxidant genes and strongly activated the transcription factor Nrf2. Using a strategy of small interfering RNA inhibition of Nrf2 expression combined with genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we determined the downstream targets of Nrf2 activation and identified Nrf2 as a critical determinant for the changes in endothelial redox balance exerted by atheroprotective flow. In addition, we showed that atheroprotective flow activates Nrf2 via the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, and this activation occurs differentially in atherosclerosis-resistant and atherosclerosis- susceptible regions of the mouse aorta. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hemodynamic forces present in atherosclerosis-resistant and -susceptible regions of the vasculature differentially regulate EC redox state and antioxidant potential. These alterations in redox homeostasis are primarily the result of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt-dependent activation of Nrf2 and its downstream transcriptional targets. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.",Biomechanical force; Endothelial cells; Nrf2; Redox homeostasis,"phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; transcription factor Nrf2; antioxidant activity; aorta; article; atherogenesis; atherosclerosis; biomechanics; cell culture; controlled study; endothelium; endothelium cell; enzyme activation; genetic transcription; hemodynamics; human; human cell; molecular dynamics; oxidation reduction state; oxidative stress; priority journal; shear stress; upregulation; 1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase; Atherosclerosis; Carotid Arteries; Cells, Cultured; Endothelium, Vascular; Enzyme Activation; Homeostasis; Humans; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Oxidation-Reduction; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Stress, Mechanical; Transcription, Genetic","Gimbrone Jr., M.A.; Office of the Chairman, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115-6110, United States; email: mgimbrone@rics.bwh.harvard.edu",,,00097330,,CIRUA,17673673.0,English,Circ.

The East Asian economies are rebounding from last year's collapse in output. Improved prospects and an easing of monetary conditions in many parts of the developing world have boosted emerging equity markets and reduced interest rates from the sky-high levels of mid-1998. Developing countries also are benefiting from the acceleration of growth and interest rate reductions in industrial countries. However, the recovery is both uneven and fragile, and many countries continue to struggle in the aftermath of the crisis. Several countries in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe face declines in output in 1999, and outside of Asia developing countries' per capita income is expected to fall. Continued imbalances in industrial countries markedly increase the risks presented by the international economic environment. Furthermore, the cyclical recovery in East Asia has not addressed severe difficulties that were either caused or exacerbated by the crisis. In addition to a review of international economic developments and prospects, Global Economic Prospects 2000 considers three areas where the crisis has had a major impact on growth and welfare in the developing world. First, the crisis has increased poverty in the East Asian crisis countries, Brazil, and the Russian Federation, and elsewhere. Chapter 2 reviews the evidence on the crisis' social impact on East Asia and other developing countries and addresses the broader issue of the impact of external shocks on poverty in developing countries. Second, though the East Asian crisis countries are experiencing a strong cyclical recovery, severe structural problems remain, notably the banking systems' high levels of nonperforming loans and the large share of insolvent firms. Chapter 3 outlines the depth of the problems faced by the corporate and financial sectors of these economies, analyzes the challenges facing the restructuring and reducing systemic risk. Third, exchange rate depreciations and declines in demand in East Asia exacerbated the fall in primary commodity prices that began in 1996. Countries that depend on primary commodities have faced an enormous challenge in smoothing consumption in the face of booms and busts in commodity prices and adjusting to the secular decline in commodity prices relative to manufactures. Chapter 4 examines how the most commodity- dependent economies in the world - the major oil exporting countries and the non-oil exporters of Sub-Saharan Africa - have adjusted to the commodity price cycle.",,economic conditions; economic development; financial crisis; future prospect; poverty alleviation,,,World Bank Publications Department,,0821345508,,,English,,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034087934,scopus

Methodology/approach - To test this hypothesis, the chapter uses the residuals of the trend relationship among housing wealth and labor income to predict both stock returns and government bond yields. Specifically, it shows that nonlinear deviations of housing wealth from its cointegrating relationship with labor income, hwy, forecast expected future returns. Findings - Using data for a set of industrialized countries, the chapter finds that when the housing wealth-to-income ratio falls, investors demand a higher risk premium for stocks. As for government bond returns: (i) when they are seen as a component of asset wealth, investors react in the same manner and (ii) if, however, investors perceive the increase in government bond returns as signaling a future rise in taxes or a deterioration of public finances, then they interpret the fall in the housing wealth-to-income ratio as a fall in future bond premia. Finally, this work shows that the occurrence of crisis episodes amplifies the transmission of housing market shocks to financial markets. Originality/value of chapter - These findings are novel. They also open new and challenging avenues for understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the housing sector, stock market and government bond developments, and the banking system.

The transmission of financial distress is governed by a heterogeneous interbank credit network and an investment portfolio of banks. Bankruptcy reproductive ratio of a financial system is computed as a function of the diversity and risk exposure of an investment portfolio of banks, and the denseness and concentration of a heterogeneous interbank credit network. An analytic solution of the bankruptcy reproductive ratio for a small financial system is derived and a numerical solution for a large financial system is obtained. For a large financial system, large diversity among banks in the investment portfolio makes financial contagion more damaging on the average. But large diversity is essentially effective in eliminating the risk of financial contagion in the worst case of financial crisis scenarios. A bank-unique specialization portfolio is more suitable than a uniform diversification portfolio and a system-wide specialization portfolio in strengthening the robustness of a financial system. © 2013 IEEE.",,Analytic solution; Financial contagions; Financial crisis; Financial distress; Financial system; Investment portfolio; Numerical solution; Optimal portfolios; Artificial intelligence; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Investments,"NEC Corporation, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa 211-8666, Japan",,,,9781467359214,,,English,"Proc.

Frequently, these actors are human agents, such as rogue traders or aggressive financial innovators, terrorists, groups of dissidents, or unauthorized sources of sensitive or secret information about government or private sector activities. In other instances, influential ""actors"" take the form of climate change, communications technologies, or socioeconomic globalization. Although these individual forces may be small relative to state governments or international institutions, or may operate on long time scales, the changes they catalyze can pose significant challenges to the analysis and practice of international relations through the operation of complex feedbacks and interactions of individual agents and interconnected systems. We call these challenges ""femtorisks,"" and emphasize their importance for two reasons. First, in isolation, they may be inconsequential and semiautonomous; but when embedded in complex adaptive systems, characterized by individual agents able to change, learn from experience, and pursue their own agendas, the strategic interaction between actors can propel systems down paths of increasing, even global, instability. Second, because their influence stems from complex interactions at interfaces of multiple systems (e.g., social, financial, political, technological, ecological, etc.), femtorisks challenge standard approaches to risk assessment, as higher-order consequences cascade across the boundaries of socially constructed complex systems. We argue that new approaches to assessing and managing systemic risk in international relations are required, inspired by principles of evolutionary theory and development of resilient ecological systems.",Complex adaptive systems; Contagion; Resilience; Risk analysis; Systemic risk,Arab; Article; authority; biological model; climate change; coping behavior; decision making; economics; environmental change; femtorisk; financial deficit; government; homicide; human; international relations; kidnapping; policy; risk; risk assessment; spring; Ukraine; war; winter,"Frank, A.B.; Department of Computational Social Science, George Mason UniversityUnited States",,National Academy of Sciences,00278424,,PNASA,,English,Proc.

Previously the authors reported a significant correlation between a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the discovery of an unruptured aneurysm in a group of healthy volunteers. This study corroborates and extends previous findings regarding the relationship between genetic and acquired factors in the formation of cerebral aneurysms. Methods. The incidence of asymptomatic, unruptured cerebral aneurysms was studied among patients with a family history of SAH within the second degree of consanguinity. Forty-one unruptured cerebral aneurysms were found in 34 (13.9%) of 244 patients. This incidence was significantly higher than that found in a control group of healthy volunteers (6%). Furthermore, patients who had a family history of SAH combined with multiple systemic risk factors were found to have the highest incidence of unruptured aneurysms (32%; odds ratio 3.49, 95% confidence interval 1.37-8.9). Conclusions. These findings suggest that patients with a family history of SAH with or without the presence of more than one systemic risk factor are at significantly higher risk of harboring cerebral aneurysms.

Our proposal would require that a small fraction of each MMF shareholder's recent balances, called the ""minimum balance at risk"" (MBR), be available for redemption only with a delay of 30 days. Most regular transactions in the fund would be unaffected; the requirement would only affect redemptions of the shareholder's MBR. In addition, in the rare event that a fund suffers losses, the MBRs of investors who have recently made large redemptions would absorb losses before those of nonredeeming investors. This subordination of redeeming investors' MBRs would create a disincentive to redeem if the fund is likely to have losses, but would have little effect on incentives when the risk of loss is remote. We use empirical evidence, including a novel data set from the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on MMF losses in 2008, to calibrate an MBR rule that would reduce the vulnerability of MMFs to runs.",,,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve SystemUnited States,,,00072303,,,,English,Brookings Pap.

In this vein, this chapter examines the experience of Canada and the United States in the run-up to the two biggest financial crises in global history, in the 1920s and 2000s, and the roles of their central banks. The central bank policy we focus on is monetary policy, but we also consider a broader set of policies that would fall under the heading of “financial stability” policy, which may not be exclusively the purview of the central bank. In this context, the goal of financial stability policy would be to limit systemic risk stemming from pro-cyclical movements in credit, leverage, and asset prices, which would render the financial system and the real economy more vulnerable to an adverse shock. Canada and the United States experienced a similar boom-bust economic cycle in the 1920s and 1930s and 2000s. Although this occurrence is perhaps not surprising given the close economic and financial relationships between the two countries, they did have very different institutional frameworks for determining monetary and financial conditions over the two periods. In the 1920s, the United States had a central bank, the Federal Reserve, that was responsible primarily for setting monetary conditions, whereas Canada was still in an era of free banking, where note issue and control of monetary conditions were primarily in the hands of the private commercial banks, although the Canadian Ministry of Finance did provide access to a lending window. In the 2000s, the Bank of Canada (BoC) followed an explicit inflation targeting rule, whereas the Federal Reserve (Fed) had a dual inflation and employment mandate. Both countries had limited micro-and macroprudential financial regulation and supervision in 1920s, which was greatly strengthened in the 1930s in the aftermath of the crisis. In contrast, in the years before the most recent crisis, Canada stepped up its financial regulation and supervision, whereas the United States deregulated. © Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 2015.",,,,,Cambridge University Press,,9781316162774; 9781107099098,,,English,Current Federal Reserve Policy Under the Lens of Economic History: Essays to Commemorate the Federal Reserve System's Centennial,Book Chapter,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954133179,scopus

Following this trail, we apply and extend the use of a data reduction technique such as principal component analysis (PCA), to assess the degree of systemic risk in the Chilean banking system. In particular, we address the following questions: (i) to what extent the degree of common risk exposure in the banking system has changed over the past decades; (ii) during which periods this exposure increased the most; and (iii) based on predefined thresholds, when this commonality has become systemically relevant. Additionally, we identify systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) based on their contribution to the degree of common risk exposure during periods of higher systemic risk. We find that prior to the 2008-09 global financial crisis the degree of common risk exposure in Chile increased significantly, and that the banks that contributed the most were not necessarily the biggest ones in size, as measured by their assets share. © 2015 IOS Press and the authors.

Under partial information on interbank links, revealed in conjunction with the spread of contagion, the optimal control problem is shown to become a Markov decision problem. We determine the optimal intervention policy by using dynamic programming. Our numerical results show that the value of the system depends on the connectivity in a nonmonotonous way: it first increases with connectivity and then decreases with connectivity. The maximum value attained depends critically on the budget of the controller.

We show that when regulatory intervention is perfect and costless, the volatility of the system can be substantially reduced with no loss of productivity. In fact, perfect credibility can actually reduce the volatility of intrinsically risky banking systems below the volatility of intrinsically less risky systems as banks anticipate intervention and mitigate their investment behaviour accordingly. However, when the credibility of the regime is weakened because of increased uncertainty stemming from regulation, such as random costs or imperfect timing of regulatory intervention, both the stability and productivity of the financial system are impaired. Importantly, we find that in the presence of regulatory costs and imperfect credibility, there is no universal optimal intervention policy rule.

Cholesterol efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) was upregulated at all sites in response to short-term high-fat diet. Proinflammatory and antioxidative endothelial gene expression profiles were induced in atherosusceptible and atheroprotected regions, respectively. However, markers for endoplasmic reticulum stress, a signature of susceptible endothelial phenotype, were not further enhanced by brief hypercholesterolemia.

In the subsequent sections, I argue that the new mechanistic and praxis-oriented mechanism of global governance is built on the nexus between (1) the G20 acting as a hub of multi-level cooperation and as an apex systemic risk manager; (2) IOs offering expertise on specific issue areas; and (3) GOs as sherpas, or ministers responsible for specific subjects, who are able to meet before and after commitments, and are endorsed by and influence the iteration leaders use at subsequent summits to soften difficult issues. The mechanism represents a departure from the Schumpeterian ""creative destruction"" process, understood in broader terms as not restricted solely to the role of entrepreneurs and innovations, but extended also towards global politics and institutions (norms, systems, and organizations). As shown in G20 communiqués and declarations, the elite global governance institutions are providing valuable input to the G20 process. A good example of the G20 and IOs' effective synergy is the relationship between the G20 and the OECD, which can be described as a ""partnership of convenience"". The activity of sherpas, finance ministers, central bank governors, expert groups and similar sub-summit entities are also an essential component of the global governance mechanism. They are all responsible for major preparatory work before G20 summits. In conclusion, I argue that the successful spreading of this mechanism makes it possible to achieve ambitious objectives, such as (1) crisis response and closing global governance gaps, (2) enhancing international cooperation, and (3) building a capacity for international innovation.",G20; Global governance; Government officials; International organizations,,"Rewizorski, M.; Institute of Political Science, Ul.

Through the MAS, the case was declared settled based on mutual commitments of the two parties, while the original violation by the US remains in place. The paper first discusses whether MAS are a means through which WTO law allows such flexibility, concluding that such a view is tenable despite valid objections. Then, it inquires whether the MAS found between Indonesia and the US can be considered an efficient breach. In this context, the paper analyses the mutual commitments of the US and Indonesia with specific attention to the potential role of power in the settlement. The paper argues that from a legal perspective the MAS between Indonesia and the US cannot be considered a case of efficient breach, although politically the situation established through the MAS resembles a situation of efficient breach. The paper finds that power imbalances played a role in the settlement and suggests that the case study of this specific MAS highlights systemic risks in the current handling of WTO dispute settlement through MAS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland and G.

One particular power, found in section 113 of the Act, gives the newly formed Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Once designated, these nonbank SIFIs are placed under the supervision of the Federal Reserve and subject to enhanced prudential regulation. In 2013, after designating four NBFIs—AIG, GE Capital, Prudential Financial, and MetLife—as systemically important, FSOC turned its attention to the asset management industry. This Note examines the efficacy of the legal framework underlying section 113 for regulating systemic risk when it arises in asset managers. By aligning the enhanced prudential standards mandated by systemic designations with the unique characteristics of the asset management industry, this Note identifies a mismatch created by deploying bank regulatory principles to address systemic risk in nonbank sectors. Ultimately, this Note argues that a better solution to the systemic oversight problem may be to limit FSOC’s role as systemic regulator to that of an information-gathering and coordinating device, while leaving prudential regulatory authority with primary regulators. © 2016 Columbia Law Review Association.

Whereas much of the extant literature has focused on the relationship between competition and the absolute level of risk of individual banks, in this paper we examine the correlation in the risk taking behavior of banks. We find that greater competition encourages banks to take on more diversified risks, making the banking system less fragile to shocks. Examining the impact of the institutional and regulatory environment on bank systemic risk shows that banking systems are more fragile in countries with weak supervision and private monitoring, greater government ownership of banks, and with public policies that restrict competition. We also find that the negative effect of lack of competition can be mitigated by a strong institutional environment that allows for efficient public and private monitoring of financial institutions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Bank competition; Bank concentration; Credit risk; Default risk; Distance to default; Lerner index; Merton model; Systemic risk,,"Anginer, D.; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State UniversityUnited States; email: danginer@vt.edu",,,10429573,,,,English,J.

The conducted analyses reveal that there is a subset of financial institutions that act as money centres. The local importance of financial institutions is moderately concentrated and assumes increased values between 2006 and 2011. Moreover, we investigate the impact that default of institutions cause on their neighbourhood and also find the most probable contagion paths within the banking system. The contagion paths change over time, but the network's central institutions remain the same. In order to assess the systemic impact of the banks' defaults, we simulate default cascades and complement the results with liquidity and solvency stress measures. We find that failure cascades hardly happen. When they do occur, the average propagation chain's length is very short. We also do not find any significant stress measure associated with banks' defaults. As a consequence, we do not find evidence of significant systemic risk associated with the BPS. Finally, we extract topological information of the network's structure by using several network measures, such as ones related to centrality and degree correlation. The extracted information is relevant for monitoring the financial stability and for understanding, in an intuitive way, many structural characteristics of the investigated network. © The authors 2014.",Complex networks; Contagion path; Payments system; Systemic risk,Complex networks; Contagion path; Degree correlation; Financial institution; Financial stability; Payments system; Structural characteristics; Systemic risks; Topological information; Finance,"Stancato de Souza, S.R.; Research Department, Brazil; email: sergio.souza@bcb.gov.br",,Oxford University Press,20511310,,,,English,J.

This transformation has been institutional and substantive. The institutional reform has taken the form of, first, the new European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), composed of national competent authorities (NCAs), the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA), and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)), and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB); and, second, sitting somewhat uneasily alongside/within the ESFS, Banking Union (composed, institutionally, of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM, composed of the ECB and NCAs) and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM, based on a complex institutional arrangement which includes the ECB, the Single Resolution Board and Fund, and national resolution authorities)). The substantive reform relates to the massive “single rule-book” which now governs banking, securities, and insurance markets in the EU. By the time the crisis-era Commission and European Parliament terms closed in mid-2014, and following the plethora of final reforms adopted by the European Parliament on “Super Tuesday” on April 15, 2014, EU financial system regulation, and its related institutional architecture, had changed beyond all recognition from the pre-crisis period. The support of pan-EU financial stability has been the defining concern of this period. But how have retail investor interests been addressed? The US and Australia, to take examples from two major retail investment markets, have engaged in wide-ranging crisis-era reforms to retail market intervention, which embrace institutional and substantive reforms. Even at the international level, where there are few incentives to engage with the retail interest given the local nature of retail markets, there is evidence of a concern to address longstanding and intractable retail market failures: the Seoul 2010 G20 meeting led to the crisis-era global agenda somewhat belatedly engaging with the retail interest and to the related November 2011 adoption by the Cannes G20 meeting of the G20/OECD High Level Principles on Consumer Protection. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,"Moloney, N.; London School of Economics and Political ScienceUnited Kingdom",,Cambridge University Press,,9781316026649; 9781107084261,,,English,Financial Regulation: A Transatl.

While state bailouts were politically sensitive, policy-makers had little alternative but to supply funds to financial institutions that were viewed as 'too big to fail', or TBTF. In this paper, I review the history of, and the rationale for, the TBTF policy. I argue that, from a policy perspective, the most important costs of the TBTF problem are incurred ex ante, in the form of distorted incentives that arise as a consequence of distortions to the capital markets, and to the choice of banks' scale and scope. I argue that it is impossible credibly to withdraw the TBTF policy, and, hence, that it should be managed so as to minimize the costs of these distortions. In this context, I discuss the role of policy in institutional design, in the restriction of bank scope, and in designing appropriate capital regulations. © The Author 2012.

In particular, it draws attention to a flaw in the design of the FSOC's power to designate nonbank financial companies as ""systemically important"" financial institutions, commonly known as ""SIFIs."" Specifically, the Article argues that the binary nature of the designation power has underappreciated costs, which hinder the FSOC's stability goals. This Article makes both positive and normative claims. First, it sheds light on the ways a binary designation power incentivizes certain financial institution behavior, such as litigation and restructuring. A binary designation power can also influence regulatory behavior by creating an opportunity for politicized decision making. This Article highlights the social and economic costs of these behaviors, which include the potential for underinclusive supervisory scope, increased information asymmetries, and distorted business decisions. Such costs can undermine the SIFI stability agenda as well as financial institution efficiency. Second, in teasing out the normative implications of that cost analysis, the Article argues for a more marginal-nuanced-apparatus for regulating nonbank financial institutions. In doing so, this Article also probes the broader question of whether the entity-based paradigm is the most effective regulatory strategy for appraising and addressing systemic risk in the nonbank arena. Ultimately, by exploring how SIFI policy should be revised to reflect these normative insights, this Article develops a broader theory about post-Crisis regulatory design-that regulators have undervalued supervision, and the information it produces, as a tool for systemic risk management outside the traditional banking system. © 2017, Christina Parajon Skinner.",,,"Skinner, C.P.; University of Oxford, United States",,Georgetown Law Journal Association,00168092,,,,English,Georget.

To enable assessment of healthcare value in stroke management, an international standard set of patient-centered stroke outcome measures was defined for use in a variety of healthcare settings. Methods - A modified Delphi process was implemented with an international expert panel representing patients, advocates, and clinical specialists in stroke outcomes, stroke registers, global health, epidemiology, and rehabilitation to reach consensus on the preferred outcome measures, included populations, and baseline risk adjustment variables. Results - Patients presenting to a hospital with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage were selected as the target population for these recommendations, with the inclusion of transient ischemic attacks optional. Outcome categories recommended for assessment were survival and disease control, acute complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes proposed for assessment at 90 days were pain, mood, feeding, selfcare, mobility, communication, cognitive functioning, social participation, ability to return to usual activities, and health-related quality of life, with mobility, feeding, selfcare, and communication also collected at discharge. One instrument was able to collect most patient-reported subdomains (9/16, 56%). Minimum data collection for risk adjustment included patient demographics, premorbid functioning, stroke type and severity, vascular and systemic risk factors, and specific treatment/care-related factors. Conclusions - A consensus stroke measure Standard Set was developed as a simple, pragmatic method to increase the value of stroke care. The set should be validated in practice when used for monitoring and comparisons across different care settings. © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.",outcome; outcome and process assessment; patient-centered outcomes research; quality improvement; stroke; stroke care,adult; Article; blood clot lysis; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; consensus; controlled study; Delphi study; disease control; feeding; health; human; medical specialist; outcome assessment; patient care; percutaneous thrombectomy; priority journal; quality of life; risk assessment; total quality management; transient ischemic attack; female; international cooperation; male; outcome assessment; risk factor; Stroke; Female; Humans; Internationality; Male; Patient Outcome Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke,"Schwamm, L.H.; Department of Neurology, United States; email: lschwamm@mgh.harvard.edu",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,00392499,,SJCCA,26604251.0,English,Stroke,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952630068,scopus

Free riding leads to excess risk production. This problem may be solved, at least partially, either by financial regulation or by taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. However, reality shows that financial regulation is adopted more frequently. This paper makes a positive, politico-economic argument. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners. The same kind of majority may strategically choose regulation in order to burden the minority with a larger share of the cost of reducing systemic risk. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Banking regulation; Financial crisis; Financial transaction taxes; Political economy; Systemic risk,,"Masciandaro, D.; Department of Economics and Paolo Baffi Centre, , Milan, Italy; email: donato.masciandaro@unibocconi.it",,,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

Often, for every participant, only the total liabilities and total assets within this network are observable. However, systemic risk assessment needs the individual liabilities. We propose a model for the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and, potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with respect to prior information included to model the network.

When initial loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are low (e.g., 80%), the sensitivity of theoretical mortgage yield spreads to housing price volatility occurs for housing price volatility at annualized rates of 9%–11%. Annual price volatilities of 9%–11% are primarily observed in ‘hot’ residential markets. When initial LTV ratios are high (e.g., 95%), we find the sensitivity of theoretical mortgage yield spreads to housing price volatility begins at annualized rates of 3%–8%, levels consistent with normal real estate markets. These sensitivities are generally irrespective of interest rate levels and interest rate volatilities. Ignoring the sensitivity of mortgage values to housing price volatility can cause lenders to misprice mortgages, and can cause insurance companies to misprice mortgage insurance. This can cause perverse incentives and unintended consequences, with substantial public policy implications including unsafe lending practices, excessive real estate speculation, and systemic risk. © 2016 American Real Estate Society.",,,,,Informa UK Ltd,10527001,,,,English,J.

In this book, the authors set the context for examining the crisis by looking at a regional crisis that occurred a decade earlier but whose lessons about financial fragility were soon forgotten. The authors then move to the present and discuss the views of a number of economics who to various degrees predicted or forewarned of the impending crisis. In the second chapter, the elements that caused the latest and current problems in the U.S. and consequently to all economists of the world, due to the systemic risk of globalization, are determined. The third chapter advocates the intangible and tacit knowledge in the knowledge based society of the 21st century, exacerbates the problem of moral agency in today's organizations, making the boundaries and accountability of decision-making especially vague and ambiguous. The authors apply this concept as a means to enhance the moral agency to organizations in the context of the knowledge based society, and as a key part of responsible leadership after the global financial crisis of 2008. The fourth chapter reviews aspects of the new rules that apply to investment firms and to banks, making comment on individual provisions as necessary.

Residences in the inner city are prone to be damaged by waterlogging hazards. This paper describes the risk analysis of rainstorm waterlogging on residences in Shanghai. First, a rainstorm scenario of 50-year return period was simulated with the rainstorm simulation model from Shanghai Flood Risk Information Center. Each residence was ranked according to its degree of exposure indicated by the inundation depth of that residence, and an exposure analysis model was then built. It is found from the exposure analysis that residences in the sub-districts like Linfen Road, Pengpu Village, Gonghe New Village, Hongqiao Road, Xianxia Road, Xinhua Road, and Zhenru Town are at high-exposure level. Whereas residences in other sub-districts like Gaojing Town, Siping Road, Huaihai Road, Yuyuan, Waitan, Caojiadu, Nanjing East Road, etc. are at low-exposure level. Second, given the characteristics of residences in waterlogging, the vulnerability of residences was expressed as the proportion of old-style residences to total residences. The results show that residences in Yuyuan, Xiaodongmen, Waitan, Nanjing East Road, Laoximen, Zhapu Road, North Station, and Tilanqiao are the most vulnerable ones, while there is no vulnerability in Fenglin Road, Kongjiang Road, Liangcheng New Village, Quyang Road, Siping Road, and Xianxia Road due to the absence of old-style residences. Finally, a model has been built from a systematic perspective and then waterlogging risk analysis was quantified by multiplying the exposure value with vulnerability value of residences. The results reveal that Laoximen, Tilanqiao, Dinghai Road, North Station, Tianping Road, Hongmei Road, Hunan Road, and Xiaodongmen are at high-risk level. The systemic risk model is a simple tool that can be used to assess the relative risk of waterlogging in different regions and the results of risk analysis are applicable to prevention and mitigation of waterlogging for Shanghai Municipal Government. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Exposure; GIS; Residences; Risk; Scenario simulation; Shanghai; Vulnerability; Waterlogging,flooding; GIS; inner city area; numerical model; rainstorm; residential location; risk assessment; vulnerability; waterlogging; China; Shanghai,"Shi, Y.; Department of Tourism and Management, , Zhengzhou 450001, China; email: yongshi@zzu.edu.cn",,,0921030X,,,,English,Nat.

Follow the money and you will understand the course of history. The nascency of mathematics was triggered by the need to solve problems related to money and finance. Modern finance experienced a meteoric rise in the 1980s, coupled with the introduction of computers on a large scale and also with the liberalisation of financial markets. Scientists from many other disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, physics, mechanics, engineering and economics, found a new uncharted territory in modern finance and they embraced the new ‘gold’ scientific race. After a sunrise there is a sunset, and exuberance quite often masks the lack of a full understanding of the complexity of problems that may surface at any moment in time. The series of crises in finance culminated with the subprime-liquidity crisis that started in 2007 that was reminiscent of the financial crash of 1929. Who was to blame and what really happened is still the subject of intensive research, and valuable lessons are to be learned. While everybody is offering an opinion about toxic assets and liquidity measures and trying to design measures of systemic risk impact, not enough attention is paid, in my opinion, to another source of future problems that could also reach catastrophic and endemic levels - that is the risk carried by different models, or, in short, model risk. What is model risk? Is it important? Can we measure it? These questions are very important for financial markets. Is Model Risk Important? There were already manifestations of model risk that led to substantial losses, and it may sound cliché to say that these were only the tip of the iceberg. In 1987 Merrill Lynch reported losses of 300 million USD on stripped mortgage-backed securities because of an incorrect pricing model and five years later in 1992 J.P. Morgan lost about 200 million USD in the mortgage-backed securities market because of inadequate modelling of prepayments. Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi announced in March 1997 that its New York subsidiary dealing with derivatives had incurred an 83 million USD loss because its internal pricing model overvalued a portfolio of swaps and options on USD interest rates. Dowd (2002) pointed out that the loss was caused by wrongly using a one-factor Black-Derman-Toy (BDT) model to trade swaptions. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,"Tunaru, R.; University of Kent Business SchoolUnited Kingdom",,Cambridge University Press,,9781316884560; 9781107185593,,,English,"Preparing for the Next Financial Crisis: Policies, Tools and Models",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048677050,scopus

The aim of the study was to assess any possible additional effect of genetic predisposition to the already well known 'classical' risk factors of RVO in a cohort of elderly Greek patients. Fifty-one elderly patients with RVO and 51 healthy individuals matched for age and sex were evaluated for systemic risk factors (smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension) and coagulation defects (lupus anticoagulant, natural inhibitors of coagulation). Additionally, genotyping was performed for mutations/polymorphisms involved in haemostasis such as: FV G1691A, FV G4070A, FIIG 20210A, MTHFR C677T and A1298C, PAI-1-675 4G/5G, F XIII exon 2G/T, EPCR A4600G and G4678C.

Methods: Retinal images from 1088 participants in the Orkney Complex Disease Study and 387 in the Croatia-Korčula study, taken using the same nonmydriatic camera system and graded by the same person, were evaluated. Using general linear models, we estimated the influence of an extensive range of systemic risk factors, calculated retinal traits heritabilities and genetic correlations. Main results: Systemic covariates explained little (<4%) of the variation in vessel tortuosity, substantially more (>10%, up to 31.7%) of the variation in vessel width and monofractal dimension. Suggestive not well trodden associations of biological interest included that of urate, tissue plasminogen activator and cardiac PR interval with arteriolar narrowing, that of carotid intima-media thickness with less-tortuous arterioles and of cardiac QT interval with more tortuous venules. The genetic underpinning of tortuosity is largely distinct from that of the other retinal vascular features, whereas that of fractal dimension and vessel width greatly overlaps. The previously recognized influence of ocular axial length on vessel widths was high and can be expected to lead to artefactual genetic associations [genetic correlation with central retinal arteriolar equivalent:-0.53 (standard error 0.11)]. The significant genetic correlation between SBP and central retinal arteriolar equivalent,-0.53 (standard error 0.22) (after adjusting for age, sex and axial length of the eye), augurs more favourably for the discovery of genetic variants relevant to vascular physiology. © 2017 The Author(s).",blood pressure; carotid intima-media thickness; genetic correlation; heritability; microvascular; ocular axial length; retinal; urate,antihypertensive agent; C reactive protein; fibrinogen; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydrocortisone; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; tissue plasminogen activator; triacylglycerol; urate; uric acid; adult; antihypertensive therapy; arterial wall thickness; Article; atheroma; blood vessel parameters; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; clinical feature; cross-sectional study; disease association; European; eye axis length; female; fibrinogen blood level; genetic association; genetic correlation; genetic trait; genetic variability; genome; globulin blood level; glucose blood level; heart depolarization; heart repolarization; hemoglobin blood level; heritability; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; microangiopathy; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; overlapping gene; population; PR interval; priority journal; QTc interval; retina blood vessel; retina disease; retina image; retinal arteriole; triacylglycerol blood level; uric acid blood level; age; blood pressure; Caucasian; coronary artery disease; Croatia; genetics; pathophysiology; risk factor; Scotland; Age Factors; Blood Pressure; Coronary Artery Disease; Croatia; Cross-Sectional Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retinal Vessels; Risk Factors; Scotland,"Vitart, V.; Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Crewe Road, United Kingdom; email: veronique.vitart@igmm.ed.ac.uk",,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,02636352,,JOHYD,28509723.0,English,J.

The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to identify and appraise all controlled observational studies that have examined risk factors for the development of nonpurulent cellulitis of the leg (NPLC). A systematic literature search of electronic databases and grey literature sources was performed in July 2015. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess methodological quality of included studies. Of 3059 potentially eligible studies retrieved and screened, six case–control studies were included. An increased risk of developing NPLC was associated with previous cellulitis [odds ratio (OR) 40·3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 22·6–72·0], wound (OR 19·1, 95% CI 9·1–40·0), current leg ulcers (OR 13·7, 95% CI 7·9–23·6), lymphoedema/chronic leg oedema (OR 6·8, 95% CI 3·5–13·3), excoriating skin diseases (OR 4·4, 95% CI 2·7–7·1), tinea pedis (OR 3·2, 95% CI 1·9–5·3) and body mass index &gt; 30 kg m−2 (OR 2·4, 95% CI 1·4–4·0). Diabetes, smoking and alcohol consumption were not associated with NPLC. Although diabetics may have been underrepresented in the included studies, local risk factors appear to play a more significant role in the development of NPLC than do systemic risk factors.

Calls are being heard in Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland to cap the size of domestic banks. Is small beautiful? In this policy paper, we first match bailing out cost data to the relative size of banks for a sample of 14 countries and 29 banks. An important observation is that some countries with relatively small banks faced large bailout cost when correlated systemic risk affected many banks. Secondly, we call to the attention that capping the size of banks can have an unintended effect: a lack of credit risk diversification. Risk diversification is needed to reduce the costs of financial distress, which are quite significant in the banking industry. If reducing public bail out costs is the right objective, capping the size of banks is not the best tool. So as to keep large banks that provide highly skilled employment opportunities in a services economy, we discuss four policy options that help to ensure financial stability: independence and accountability of bank supervisors, prompt corrective action mechanisms, burden sharing across countries, and an end to the too-big-to-fail doctrine. © 2010 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"Dermine, J.; Department of Banking and Finance, email: Jean.DERMINE@insead.edu",,,09638008,,,,English,Financ.

It concludes by drawing some conclusions on the policy challenges facing authorities charged with regulating shadow banking. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on findings from prior research and statistics. Findings – On a general level, the paper shows that even though traditional investment funds and hedge funds may be very different in terms of their investment strategies and business models, some of them share several commonalities from a systemic risk perspective. More specifically, it discusses how instability in the funding profile of investment funds may threaten their ability to substitute banks’ maturity and liquidity transformation; that their potential funding liquidity shortages, asset reallocations and leverage may contribute to procyclicality in credit and market runs on the systemic money and short-term credit markets; and that insufficient risk separation may elude managerial and supervisory oversight, and force banks to reduce or interrupt credit intermediation. Research limitations/implications – The paper points to the lack of timely and comprehensive data for uncovering the stages and entities involved in shadow banking. Without sufficient data, the task of policy bodies, regulators or macroprudential authorities to fully grasp shadow banking and its contribution to systemic risk is daunting. Originality/value – The paper represents (to the author’ knowledge) the first analysis of the role of investments in shadow banking. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Investment funds; Shadow banking; Systemic risk,,"Bengtsson, E.; ECBGermany; email: bengtsson.elias@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,13581988,,,,English,J.

Those works that do consider sustainability find that sterilization is possible in the long run if domestic interest rates remain below foreign rates; if capital markets are imperfect; or if the scale of sterilization does not become too large. This paper asserts that sterilization may not be possible in the long run since it engenders a spirit of moral hazard, thus increasing systemic risk within the banking system, leading to a highly risky, speculative bubble. Loading the banking system with low risk, low yielding sterilization assets encourages banks to seek out riskier investments to balance their unduly secure portfolios. China is considered to be a good example of this phenomenon. China has engaged in massive sterilization over the last five years and has consequently experienced a bubble in lending. As a result, China will quite likely be forced by objective circumstances to reduce the scale of its sterilization efforts and allow greater flexibility of its currency in the future.",Foreign exchange reserves; Monetary policy; Moral hazard,,"Kleykamp, D.; Department of Economics, Taiwan",,,10274979,,,,English,Tamkang J.

Two early-warning indicators for financial crises are identified: First, the algebraic connectivity of the equity securities network, as a measure for structural robustness, drops close to zero already in 2005, while there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an investigation of such nodes with respect to the structural stability of the global financial system.

Although much of this debate so far has focused on the inter-firm and intra-group dealings among financial firms that the crisis has exposed as sites of systemic risk, the catalytic effects of the insecurities and vulnerabilities experienced by sub-prime borrowers in the US and by Northern Rock savers in the UK has given new prominence to the regulation and governance of personal financial transactions. Responding to the urgency of the perceived need to strengthen consumer confidence in banks, European jurisdictions moved swiftly to shore up depositor compensation funds, increase coverage limits and eliminate co-insurance requirements, apparently with little regard to the moral hazard consequences of such measures. Other consumer-oriented proposals for the new regulatory order include financial product safety regulation, additional information sharing and disclosure measures, further development of responsible lending standards, and the activation of the self-protective capacities of financial consumers through financial education and advice and, where possible, carefully crafted default rules. Many such proposals build on the regulatory foundation that has been laid by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the UK's main market regulator of consumer financial markets and products. Despite operating for most of its short life in an environment that celebrated ‘light-touch’ regulation, the FSA has nonetheless created an innovative model of fair dealing in consumer financial transactions. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,,"Williams, T.; Kent Law SchoolUnited Kingdom",,Cambridge University Press,,9780511760938; 9780521190534,,,English,Unconscionability in European Private Financial Transactions: Protecting the Vulnerable,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890722429,scopus

While global policy has focused on facilitating integration, the implications of growing interdependence have been largely ignored. The acceleration in global integration has brought many benefits, but it also has created fragility through the production of new kinds of systemic risks. This article provides a framework for understanding these new 21st-century systemic risks and examines the challenges they pose to global governance. The 2008-2009 financial crisis will be used to illustrate the failure of even sophisticated global institutions to manage the underlying forces of systemic risk. We show this is symptomatic of institutional failure to keep pace with globalisation. The failure of the most developed and best-equipped global governance system, finance, to recognise or manage the new vulnerabilities associated with globalisation in the 21st century highlights the scale and urgency of the global governance challenge. © 2010 London School of Economics and Political Science and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"Goldin, I.; Balliol College, United Kingdom",,,17585880,,,,English,Global Policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957555089,scopus

Government subsidy or reinsurance has therefore been used to support crop insurance programs. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of converting systemic crop yield risk into “poolable” risk. Specifically, this study examines whether it is possible to remove the co-movement as well as tail dependence of crop yield variables by enlarging the risk pool across different crops and countries. Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical Kendall copula (HKC) models are used to model potential non-linear correlations of the high-dimensional crop yield variables. A Bayesian estimation approach is applied to account for estimation risk in the copula parameters. A synthetic insurance portfolio is used to evaluate the systemic risk and diversification effect. Findings: The results indicate that the systemic nature – both positive correlation and lower tail dependence – of crop yield risks can be eliminated by combining crop insurance policies across crops and countries. Originality/value: The study applies the HKC in the context of agricultural risks. Compared to other advanced copulas, the HKC achieves both flexibility and parsimony. The flexibility of the HKC makes it appropriate to precisely represent various correlation structures of crop yield risks while the parsimony makes it computationally efficient in modeling high-dimensional correlation structure. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Agriculture; Crop insurance; Diversification effect; Hierarchical Kendall copulas; Systemic risk,,"Feng, X.; Department of Economics, United States; email: xgfeng@iastate.edu",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,00021466,,,,English,Agric.

However, considering the wide variety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, so far there has not been a full investigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism. In this work, using the recently available world input-output database, we investigated the evolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a time series of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving system via different known properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time, Kemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the transition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and Kemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we focused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of the economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional index of economies welfare. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk, called systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio of number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock in the activity of a node, and the latter is based on the number of times a specific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the other nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of monetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect of a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the world economic network. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high structural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network, there are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the network in terms of connectivity and the average flow of the money. © 2017 Moosavi, Isacchini.

In this study we addressed the molecular and cellular effects of elevated and suppressed levels of circulating cholesterol on the normal prostate. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was performed using DNA microarray data from two experimental formats: (1) ventral prostate from male mice with chronically elevated circulating cholesterol and (2) human prostate cells exposed acutely to cholesterol depletion. A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels. These findings open new perspectives on the role of cholesterol in prostate health, and provide a novel role for ATF3, and associated proteins within a large signaling network, as a cholesterol-sensing mechanism. © 2012 Kim et al.",,"activating transcription factor 3; cholesterol; activating transcription factor 3; ATF3 protein, human; Atf3 protein, mouse; cholesterol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cell infiltration; cell proliferation; cholesterol synthesis; controlled study; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; human; human cell; hypocholesterolemia; in vivo study; male; male genital system function; microarray analysis; molecular model; molecular recognition; mouse; nonhuman; prostate; protein function; sensitivity analysis; signal transduction; structural bioinformatics; validation process; adipose tissue; animal; biosynthesis; blood; cell proliferation; metabolism; methodology; mouse mutant; physiology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Mus; Activating Transcription Factor 3; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cholesterol; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, SCID; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Prostate; Signal Transduction","Kim, J.; Division of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, , Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: Jayoung.Kim@cshs.org",,,19326203,,,22768301.0,English,PLoS ONE,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863611350,scopus

To identify the genetic factors involved in lesion initiation, we studied a cross between C3H and the susceptible strain C57BL/6J (B6) on a hyperlipidemic (apolipoprotein E-null) background. METHODS AND RESULTS - Whereas a previous cross in mice fed a Western diet for 16 weeks revealed a very complex inheritance pattern with many significant lesion QTLs, the present cross, on a chow diet, revealed a single major locus on chromosome 9 (lod=5.0, Ath29*), and a suggestive locus on chromosome 4 (lod=2.6, Ath8). QTLs for plasma HDL, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were found on chromosome 1 over the ApoA2 gene. Neither of the lesion QTLs were associated with differences in plasma lipid levels or other systemic risk factors, consistent with the concept that genetic factors affecting cellular functions of the vessel wall are important determinants of atherosclerosis susceptibility. We generated a congenic strain for Ath29 and confirmed its contribution to lesion development. Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, is located in the Ath8 region and is known to be defective in C3H/HeJ mice. We constructed a congenic strain carrying a normal Tlr4 gene on the C3H Apoe-null background and found that the defective Tlr4 does not contribute significantly to lesion resistance during early lesion development. CONCLUSIONS - We identified one major QTL on chromosome 9, Ath29, for early lesion development in the BXH ApoE cross fed on a chow diet and confirmed its contribution in congenic mice. We have also determined that Tlr4 on the C3H ApoE background does not contribute to early lesion development. *Ath29 is referred to as Ath22 in Su et al 2006. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.",Atherosclerosis; C3H/HeJ; Quantitative trait locus,"apolipoprotein A2; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; lipid; lipopolysaccharide; toll like receptor 4; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; ath29; atherosclerosis; blood vessel wall; C3H mouse; cardiovascular risk; cell function; cholesterol blood level; chromosome 1; chromosome 4; chromosome 9; chromosome identification; congenic strain; controlled study; disease course; disease predisposition; disease resistance; female; gene isolation; gene locus; gene mapping; genetic association; heredity; hyperlipidemia; inheritance; lipid blood level; lipoprotein blood level; male; mouse; nonhuman; null cell; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; triacylglycerol blood level; Animals; Apolipoproteins E; Atherosclerosis; Chromosome Mapping; Crosses, Genetic; Dietary Fats; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Lipids; Mice; Mice, Congenic; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mutation; Quantitative Trait Loci; Risk Factors; Toll-Like Receptor 4","Lusis, A.J.; UCLA School of Medicine, , Los Angeles, CA 90095-1679, United States; email: jlusis@mednet.ucla.edu",,,10795642,,ATVBF,17916774.0,English,Arterioscler.

Also, even though existing regulators supervise individual banks for safety and soundness, there are risks that do not reside with those institutions but may still adversely affect the banking system as a whole. Macroprudential policy refers to a variety of tasks designed to defend the broad financial system against threats to its stability. Responsibilities include monitoring the system for systemic risk vulnerabilities; developing early warning systems of financial distress; conducting stress-testing exercises; and advising other regulatory agencies on matters related to financial stability. H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 (Representative Barney Frank), establishes a Financial Services Oversight Council with macroprudential regulatory responsibilities. On March 22, 2010, the Senate Banking Committee ordered reported the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 (Senator Christopher Dodd), which also would establish a Financial Services Oversight Council with similar responsibilities.

Systemic risk comes about as soon as firms diversify their collateral by holding claims on a big wholesale (merchant) bank whose asset side includes claims on the same producer set. The merchant bank sector proves to be fragile (has a short distance to default) regardless of competition. In this setting, the policy response, consisting in official guarantees for the merchant bank's liabilities, entails considerable government loss risk. An alternative without the need for public sector involvement is to encourage systemically important merchant banks to introduce a simple bail-in mechanism by restricting their liabilities to contingent convertible bonds.

To assess sequential chemical exposure effect on chemical cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of a toxicant, [14C]-pentachlorophenol (PCP) was topically administered in three porcine skin models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro) at 40 μg/cm2 with or without skin preexposure to benzo[a]-pyrene (BaP), a known human carcinogen and cutaneous cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) inducer. In the mass balance studies, BaP skin preexposure was found to enhance 14C absorption in all three models with detectable in vivo effect during the first several days. Total 8-h absorption was tripled by skin preexposure to BaP in the ex vivo (1.1 to 3.2%) and in vitro (0.20 to 0.66%) systems. As seen in the extended in vivo studies, total absorption was 50-57% regardless of exposure conditions, suggesting the prolonged observation period may conceal existing impact of potentially modified disposition processes, such as cutaneous metabolism, on systemic absorption. Skin preexposure to the skin CYP450 inducer BaP largely changed label penetration depth and distribution pattern in cutaneous tissues and decreased 14C concentration in skin and fat. Additionally, BaP preexposure altered 14C systemic tissue disposition, suggesting that altered cutaneous PCP disposition may eventually change the toxicity profile (cutaneous vs. systemic risk). The preliminary tissue distribution and systemic absorption data suggested that skin preexposure to BaP may considerably modify cutaneous biotransformation rate and thus deserves further investigation. The dermal model-dependent impacts of expected skin biotransformation manipulation by preexposure to chemicals such as BaP on cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of environmental toxicants such as PCP need to be considered in risk assessment.",,"benzo[a]pyrene; pentachlorophenol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; drug transformation; environmental exposure; female; isotope labeling; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; skin absorption; skin penetration; swine; toxicokinetics; Adipose Tissue; Administration, Cutaneous; Animals; Benzo(a)pyrene; Biotransformation; Carcinogens; Drug Interactions; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Pentachlorophenol; Risk Assessment; Skin; Swine; Tissue Distribution; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa","Qiao, G.L.; US-FDA, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, United States; email: GQiao@cvm.fda.gov",,,15287394,,JTEHD,12227954.0,English,J.

We explore the unintentional consequences, uncertain risk, and the systemic risk that we are yet to know. In particular, we examine unexpected failures of human-technology interaction. Conventionally, IS researchers tend to assume risk management as tradeoffs involved in risk-taking, and they rely on various probability and statistical approaches offering a rigorous basis for informing decision. The topic where risks are most widely documented is IS security. Yet, the conceptualization of uncertain risk remains unclear. This paper proposes a reconceputalization of knowledge of risk that incorporates both probability risk and uncertain risk. Drawing on Stirling's (2007) classification of incomplete knowledge, risk, uncertainty, ambiguity and ignorance, we report our pre-test results from dominant IS literature (2010-2015). We present evidence of our assertion that IS research has yet to deeply engage the notion of uncertain risk. This paper suggests that the precautionary principle drawing from jurisdiction, policy areas allow a deeper and broader understanding of knowledge of risk in the IS field.

The outcome of the UK Brexit referendum in June revealed the deep divide between the politics of competitive nationalism and the commitment to international cooperation. It also reflected the depth of public reaction to global economic integration and the absence of response to public anxieties about social well-being and environmental sustainability from the political middle in many countries. China’s hosting of the G20 Summit presents an opportunity to turn a corner in global summitry by strengthening global leadership at this critical juncture, while China’s ability to do so depends on the willingness of other G20 members to comprehensively address public anxieties. The UN 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement, both reached in 2015, do provide political and policy answers to the public anxieties. The question is the effectiveness of the initiatives governments are taking to implement them, which could be framed together to achieve sustainability for all in the face of serious, demonstrable systemic risks. Many governments may resist this level of ambition and prefer to strike a lower profile as the world shifts its focus from goal setting in 2015 to goal implementation in 2016. Yet even with this less ambitious approach, there are ways that G20 countries can initiate processes that engage stakeholders in envisioning the future and developing alternative approaches and pathways to move their nations toward where they need to be by 2030 in terms of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. As people-centered and planet-centered agendas, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set in the UN 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement have the policy content necessary to provide hope and direction for anxious publics. Similarly, it is hopeful that G20 leaders can develop narratives and define commitments to address the economic insecurity of their people and in the meantime strengthen the G20’s role in global governance. © 2016 World Century Publishing Corporation and Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.",Global governance; Group of twenty (G20); Strategic leadership; Sustainable development goals (SDGs),,"Bradford, C.I.Massachusetts Avenue, United States; email: cbradford@brookings.edu",,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Besides the misjudged risks generated by fi nancial innovation as well as fi nancial pathology and general incomprehension of fi nance as such, two further misconceptions are of interdisciplinary nature. On the one hand, the risk-Type that was brought to the surface by the Credit Crunch was systemic risk; a risk of complexity and dimensions that was corollary only to the Great Depression erupting in 1929. From a legal perspective, this meant unprecedented interpenetration of various branches of law, from mortgage and corporate to securities law. The central piece in the puzzle - asset securitization - was a synergic product of these. The fi rst conclusion the paper draws is that in the light of this there is a need for a new legal discipline - the law of fi nance - that would spread over all these branches of law (internal inter-disciplinarity). On the other hand, both the Credit Crunch as well as the subsequent developments on fi nancial markets show that understanding fi nance and the risks inherent to it are not only becoming increasingly problematic (not only for lawyers) but that some of the risks are unidentifi able (""unknown unknowns""). Finance is inherently complex, yet further exacerbating factors are the growing presence of technology, mathematization of fi nance (and economics) and the possible synergic effects of various, often seemingly not linked, fi nancial products. The second claim this paper makes consequently is that legal scholarship should face, comprehend and reckon with the roles other disciplines increasingly play in fi nance (external inter-disciplinarity) and the fundamentally altered nature of fi nance. Subscribing to the conclusion - on an abstract and theoretical level - that the looming crises should be perceived as multi-disciplinary phenomena that as such require multi-disciplinary panacea and more cooperation from the affected disciplines would be easy. In reality, however, little seems to have changed. Suffi ce to take a look at law school curricula to realize that actually few have recipes for such seemingly simple but practical questions as how to teach the law of fi nance, especially where consensus has not been reached even on whether teach it at all. Equally heavy dilemmas are already presented for regulators or judges when deciding on issues from the realms of fi nance law.",Finance law; Financial innovation; Inter-disciplinarity; Law versus regulation; Mathematization,,"Tajti, T.; Department of Law and Head of the International Business Law Program, Hungary; email: tajtit@ceu.edu",,Akademiai Kiado Rt.,15889726,,,,English,Soc.

Concerns about potential spillovers generate strategic interaction, triggering a pre-emption game in which one tries to exit the market before others to avoid spillovers.

There is little data regarding the impact of the disease and treatments on sexual function. The aim of this study was to describe the results of an assessment of sexual activity/sexual satisfaction of rheumatoid arthritis patients, identify the sexual dysfunction features, and assess their association with disease activity/disease activity parameters and other systemic risk factors/comorbidities. Consecutive rheumatoid arthritis patients attending the outpatient rheumatology clinic completed the multidimensional patient-reported outcome measures questionnaire. There are three questions screening for sexual dysfunction: patients who ticked any of the boxes were further assessed. Men completed the Sexual Health Inventory for Men; whereas women completed the Female Sexual Function Index. All patients underwent clinical assessment of disease activity parameters and cardiovascular risk. Among 231 rheumatoid arthritis patients included in this study, 49/91 (53.8%) men and 64/140 (45.7%) women reported sexual dysfunction. Among men, erectile dysfunction significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with pain score, cardiovascular disease, age, disease activity, fatigue score, intramuscular steroid injection, and tender joint count. Among women, sexual dysfunction was significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with occurrence of secondary Sjogren's syndrome, pain score, cardiovascular disease, hip joint involvement, disease activity, and tender joint count. Sexual dysfunction is common among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Erectile dysfunction in men, and problems with orgasm, arousal, and satisfaction in women, were the most prevalent manifestations.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (WSRCPA) aims in part to address this risk by granting regulators the authority to impose prudential requirements on hedge funds. Crucial to the effectiveness of this authority will be the ability of regulators to timely and accurately identify which funds should be subject to such requirements. The WSRCPA requires U.S. hedge fund managers to self-identify the funds they manage by registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In contrast, foreign hedge fund managers whose funds do not include a threshold number of U.S. investors or amount of capital managed on behalf of U.S. investors are not required to register. As a result, to fulfill their statutory responsibility to protect the U.S. economy from systemic risks, regulators will themselves need to identify which foreign funds could pose a risk to the U.S. economy. The scope and quality of public information and the potential unreliability of international cooperation make it unlikely that U.S. regulators can accurately, promptly, and efficiently identify such funds. Exempting foreign hedge fund managers from the registration requirement therefore frustrates the ability of U.S. regulators to manage systemic risk. To fill this gap, managers of foreign hedge funds that meet thresholds for holdings of U.S. assets and obligations to U.S. lenders should be made to register with the SEC. Although the opportunity to narrow the WSRCPA's ""foreign private adviser"" exemption has passed, an alternative vehicle for bringing about self-identification exists in the SEC's proposed Large Trader Reporting System rule.",,,"Overmyer, M.

The positive effect is due to mitigation of the local risks, and the negative effect is due to potential risk exposure cascades. While systemic risk of undesirable cascades can be naturally defined at the micro-level, inherently macroscopic nature of systemic risk suggests a possibility of macro-level description. We propose a Perron-Frobenius based macro-description of systemic risk.

The aim is to develop a method to assess thoroughly the sensitivity of the network to potential individual insolvencies. For this purpose, given a state of the network, the insolvency of an agent is assumed and the cascade of provoked insolvencies is simulated. Exploring the matrix definition of the network, this is made systematically for all agents. Therefore, in only one run of the procedure, all the possible trajectories of insolvencies, each beginning in a different agent, are calculated. This allows spotting at a glance which agents are ""systemically riskier"". Determination of adequate capital levels can be made on a case basis by running the procedure repeatedly. This work contributes with two new aspects to the existing literature. First, given a known situation of a credit and debt network, a computing procedure is presented that allows to assess the network sensitivity to the exogenous insolvency of any of its nodes. Second, continued monitoring of a credit and debt network is computationally feasible. This ""proof of concept"" software can be extended into a tool useful for research and regulation, if the relevant information is made available. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",balance sheet insolvency; banking networks; Credit and debt networks; financial crisis; insolvency propagation; Julia programming; systemic risk,,"Dias, A.; LIAAD INESC TEC and Faculdade de Economia, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias, Portugal; email: diasandre@gmail.com",,World Scientific Publishing Co.

Complexity and network theory which can help identify the extent to which the financial system is resilient to contagion as well as the nature of major triggers and channels of contagion. However, the methodological suitability of the premises of complexity theory for financial systems is still debatable. The use of complexity analysis in finance draws on two distinct but related strands of theory: econophysics and econobiology. Each strand is associated with advantages and drawbacks in explaining the dynamics of financial systems.

The framework is inspired by evolutionary ecosystems, including ecology, economics, technology, psychology, and sociology. Adaptive Stress Testing harnesses network intelligence to integrate early warning signals. We pre-diagnose systemic fragilities by tapping into the marketplace of ideas, and then identify key metrics to monitor market–based early warning signals. We apply the Technology Adoption Lifecycle model to develop a theory of social diffusion of disruptive information in financial markets. We start by taking a macro view of risk in its hidden potential form, and then focus on phase transition signals as risk becomes visible. This process allows us to better understand key systemic risks, and to more effectively sense and respond to emerging risks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Behavioral economics; Black swan; Complexity; Disruptive innovation; Dragon king; Early warning; Eco-centric risk management; Financial cartography; Financial network analysis; Foreshocks; Groupthink; HeavyTailsTM; Integral theory; Network theory; Network visualization; Outliers; Phase transitions; Polarity management; Risk culture; Social adoption; Social market hypothesis; Stress indices; Stress testing; Stress testing; StressGradesTM; Subprime crisis; Systemic risk; VaR backtesting,,"Laubsch, A.; Financial Network Analytics (FNA)United Kingdom",,Springer International Publishing,,9783319099460; 9783319099453,,,English,Financial Econometrics and Empiri.

Recent work on cellular responses to flow has identified potential mechanosensors and pathways that may influence disease progression. These results led us to hypothesize that the same mechanisms that mediate adaptive responses in the vasculature become maladaptive at sites of disturbed flow. Subsequent changes in gene expression and matrix remodeling help to entrain these inflammatory pathways.

Our results indicate that increasing the system size causes breakdowns to become more abrupt; in fact, mapping the system to a solvable statistical-physics model indicates the occurrence of a first order transition in the large size limit.

However, this approach is also challenged by the globalization of certain threats. The transformation of these threats into global and systemic risks calls for a new conceptual framework.

We offer a pedagogical introduction to the use of the graph theory in finance and to some tools provided by this method. As we focus on systemic risk, we first examine correlation-based graphs in order to investigate markets integration and inter/cross-market linkages. We then restrain the analysis to a subset of these graphs, the so-called ""minimum spanning trees.""

It focuses particularly on ACS manifesting as myocardial infarction (both NSTEMI and STEMI), since this is of most clinical importance. Since the majority of ACSs are triggered by rupture of non-flow-limiting plaques, many or most ACSs occur in patients with no preceding symptoms of angina. The systemic risk factors that predispose to atherosclerosis and thus myocardial infarction (MI) are well understood at a population level. Treatment of ACS has been defined in large-scale, randomised trials conducted in patients with spontaneous (Type 1) MI or unstable angina, rather than in peri-operative or critically ill patients.

As such, the liquidation index spikes during fire sales episodes and can hence be used in a systemic risk management perspective, as it enables to detect fire sales episodes - even complex liquidation events such as the hedge fund crash of August 2007 which was undetected by commonly-used monitoring tools.

The social impact of an event resulting from a pressure special equipment, namely a risk intensity as a modified factor is introduced in this paper based on the traditional description of risk. A systemic risk model is developed after the consequences of failure is modified by the risk intensity.

We study the systematic risk of banks before the crisis, using two samples of banks respectively trading Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this decomposition shows that the increase in the beta is solely due to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater systemic risk. This creates a challenge for financial regulation, which has typically focused on individual institutions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Credit derivatives; Securitization; Subprime crisis; Systemic risk,,"Wagner, W.; Center European Banking Center and Department of Economics, Postbus 90153, 5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; email: wagner@uvt.nl",,,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of these polymorphisms among RVO Tunisian patients with and without systemic risk factors. Seventy-two patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) were studied. The control group included140 people matched for age, sex, and risk factors. Participants in the study were genotyped for the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. The genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of the three genotypes (AA, AC, CC) of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism between RVO patients and healthy controls. However, the prevalence of the group of mutated genotypes (AC+CC) of the missense variant MTHFR A1298C was significantly different between patients and controls (16.67% vs. 6.42%, p=01). Additionally, the frequency of the CT genotype as well as the group of combined mutated genotypes (CT+TT) for the C677T variant was significantly higher among RVO patients compared with controls (p&lt;10-3, p&lt;10-3). This suggests an association between this polymorphism and RVO.

This wisdom thus argues that through contracts risk is shifted to those better able to handle these uncertainties while dispersing the risk across more participants. The recent global financial crisis, however, brings these claims and assumptions into doubt. Indeed these financial instruments may add to and concentrate the amount risk that must be managed and regulated rather than transferring it to more and stronger hands. Indeed recent experience with situations such as the near collapse of AIG and the bankruptcy of Lehman has caused regulators to instigate new regulations such as the Volker Rule to limit contractual risk exposure. Further some financial firms have exploited their greater sophistication to shift contractual risk to those with little understanding of the actual risks involved as in Detroit's recent bankruptcy filing. Therefore in explaining how contractual risk occurs this chapter also indicates why the laws and regulations requiring more capital, separate trading entities and the use of exchanges may not be enough to limit global contractual exposures and the related financial systemic risk. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Materials and Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study carried out over a period of 2 years, type 2 diabetic patients seeking ocular evaluation for DR were assessed for presence and severity of DR, presence of hard exudates and CSME. Retinal findings were correlated to severity of microalbuminuria, hemoglobin concentration and other systemic risk factors using linear regression analysis. Results: Three hundred and six patients were included in the study. DR of any grade was seen in 132 (43%) patients, hard exudate formation in 93/306 (30.4%) patients, CSME in 50/306 (16.3%) patients and proliferative DR in 26/306 (8.5%) patients. Duration of diabetes (P < 0.001), microalbuminuria (P < 0.001) and low hemoglobin (P = 0.001) were found to be highly significant risk factors for the development and increasing severity of DR as well as for CSME and hard exudate formation. Conclusion: Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin are strong predictors for DR, CSME and hard exudate formation in type 2 diabetics even after correcting for duration of diabetes and other systemic risk factors. Although not directly involved in the pathogenesis, microalbuminuria can help in identifying patients at risk for more severe diabetic eye disease. Microalbuminuria warrants intensive monitoring of both retinal and renal status. The hemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly in diabetic patients to detect and treat anemia, thereby reducing one risk factor for DR.",Anemia; diabetic retinopathy; microalbuminuria; severity,"hemoglobin; adult; aged; albuminuria; anemia; article; blood; cross-sectional study; diabetic retinopathy; exudate; female; hospitalization; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; prospective study; retina macula edema; risk factor; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albuminuria; Anemia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Exudates and Transudates; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Linear Models; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index","Nithyanandam, S.; Department of Ophthalmology, , Bangalore - 560 034, India; email: uneetha.n.lobo@gmail.com",,,03014738,,IJOMB,21586841.0,English,Indian J.

A common approach is to build predictive models based on macro-financial vulnerability indicators to identify systemic risk at an early stage. In this article, we outline an approach for identifying different systemic risk states through possibilistic fuzzy clustering. Instead of directly using a supervised classification method, we aim at identifying coherent groups of vulnerability with macro-financial indicators for pre-crisis data, and determine the level of risk for a new observation based on its similarity to the identified groups. The approach allows for differentiating among different possible pre-crisis states, and using this information for estimating the possibility of systemic risk. In this work, we compare different fuzzy clustering methods, as well as conduct an empirical exercise for European systemic banking crises. © 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

To describe a reproducible method of quantifying macular hard exudates (HEs) in diabetic maculopathy and determine the associations of HEs with systemic risk factors. Methods. Patients with diabetes were recruited from a tertiary eye hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Total macular area covered by HEs (total HE area) and the distance from the foveal center to the nearest HE were measured in a semi-automated manner. Associations between HE parameters and diabetic complication risk factors were examined using multiple linear regression models. Results. Of 593 participants (mean age 60.5-years old), 97 (16.4%) had HEs in at least one eye, due to diabetic maculopathy. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for inter and intra-observer agreements were 0.982 and 0.999, respectively. Total HE area was positively associated with qualitative HE severity scale determined by photographic graders. The median of total HE area was 0.089 mm2 (interquartile range, 0.027-0.246). The median distance between foveal center and the nearest HE was 791.1 μm (431.9-1385.4). After adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin, mean arterial pressure, diabetic retinopathy level, and use of lipid-lowering medication, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = 0.009), and triglyceride levels (P = 0.036) were positively associated with total HE area. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with central involvement (P = 0.023). Conclusions. Quantitative measurement of HEs in patients with diabetes is associated with lipid levels, and higher triglyceride levels are associated with a higher risk of central involvement. Quantitative information may be useful to monitor HE progression or treatment response in persons with diabetic maculopathy. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.",Diabetes; Diabetic macular edema; Hard exudate; Quantitative measurement; Serum lipid,hemoglobin A1c; lipid; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; article; diabetes mellitus; diabetic macular edema; disease severity; exudate; female; human; laser coagulation; macular thickness; major clinical study; male; microalbuminuria; observer variation; optical coherence tomography; priority journal; questionnaire; reproducibility; retina fovea; retina maculopathy; risk factor,"Wang, J.

We find no evidence that hedge funds systematically benefit from opportunistic trading. In contrast, some funds operating with strategies that commonly utilize leverage (e.g., f ixed income arbitrage and event-driven strategies) perform significantly worse than would be expected given ex ante risk-factor loadings. This suggests that forced liquidations probably caused some funds to sell into a falling market at fire-sale prices. However, underperformance is not concentrated in specific funds that use leverage or during the height of the systemic risks in September 2008, indicating that selling pressure likely derives from meeting redemptions versus forced selling during the crisis. These results suggest new policies regulating hedge funds should focus on certain fund-level risks instead of strategy or industry risk s.",,,"Brown, G.W.; Kenan-Flagler Business School, , Chapel Hill, NC, United States; email: gregwbrown@unc.edu",,,10741240,,,,English,J.

Systemic risk arises if distressed fi nancial institutions put the stability of the entire fi nancial system at risk, thus impairing its functioning and the provisioning of services to the real economy, with negative implications for economic growth. Macroprudential policy aims at increasing the overall resilience of the fi nancial system by monitoring the allocation of risk in the fi nancial system and by preventing the build-up of excessive risks. In the aftermath of the crisis, new institutions were established and macroprudential instruments were created. Responsibility for macroprudential policy is located mostly at the national level.
