"Hurd, T.R.; Gleeson, J.P.; Melnik, S.",A framework for analyzing contagion in assortative banking networks,"We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking networks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous work on random financial networks assumes independent connections between banks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge probabilities (i.e., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge probabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition, analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 in epidemic modelling, that characterizes whether or not a single initially defaulted bank can trigger a cascade that extends to a finite fraction of the infinite network. This cascade condition is an easily computed measure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology. We use percolation theory for random networks to derive a formula for the frequency of global cascades. These analytical are shown to provide limited quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo simulation studies of finite-sized networks. We show that edge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade condition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and we propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the graph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk. 2017 Hurd et al.

"Hryckiewicz, A.; Scribner, A.Ł.",Banking business models and the nature of financial crisis,"In our paper, we analyze heterogeneity among the various business models that incorporate systemically important banks in 65 countries over the period of 2000 2012. For the first time, we identify true banking strategies in a portfolio context, that is, consisting of various combinations of bank assets and funding sources. Next, we estimate the way distinct strategies have affected bank profitability and risk before the crisis, as well as their impact on the mortgage crisis. We demonstrate that during the mortgage crisis, the investment model indicated the lowest individual risk and highest systemic risk simultaneously. Consequently, we document that the funding structure was responsible for the systemic effect of the mortgage crisis. Further, we demonstrate that countries with systemically important banks that rely on investment activities experience a greater, but more short-lived decline in GDP, when compared to countries that have predominantly traditional banking activities. 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017,2017-01-01,22,Journal of International Money and Finance,bank regulation; bank risk; banking stability; business model; financial crisis; systemic risk,"Hryckiewicz, A.

"Poledna, S.; Bochmann, O.; Thurner, S.","Basel III capital surcharges for g-sibs are far less effective in managing systemic risk in comparison to network-based, systemic risk-dependent financial transaction taxes","In addition to constraining bilateral exposures of financial institutions, there exist essentially two options for future financial regulation of systemic risk: First, regulation could attempt to reduce the financial fragility of global or domestic systemically important financial institutions (G-SIBs or D-SIBs), as for instance proposed by Basel III. Second, it could focus on strengthening the financial system as a whole by reducing the probability of large-scale cascading events. This can be achieved by re-shaping the topology of financial networks. We use an agent-based model of a financial system and the real economy to study and compare the consequences of these two options. By conducting three computer experiments with the agent-based model we find that re-shaping financial networks is more effective and efficient than reducing financial fragility. Capital surcharges for G-SIBs could reduce systemic risk, but they would have to be substantially larger than those specified in the current Basel III proposal in order to have a measurable impact. This would cause a loss of efficiency. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017,2017-01-01,18,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,agent-based modeling; banking regulation; basel iii; debtrank; resilience; systemic risk,"Poledna, S.

"Krichene, H.; Chakraborty, A.; Inoue, H.; Fujiwara, Y.",Business cycles' correlation and systemic risk of the japanese supplier-customer network,"This work aims to study and explain the business cycle correlations of the Japanese production network. We consider the supplier-customer network, which is a directed network representing the trading links between Japanese firms (links from suppliers to customers). The community structure of this network is determined by applying the Infomap algorithm. Each community is defined by its GDP and its associated business cycle. Business cycle correlations between communities are estimated based on copula theory. Then, based on firms' attributes and network topology, these correlations are explained through linear econometric models. The show strong evidence of business cycle correlations in the Japanese production network. A significant systemic risk is found for high negative or positive shocks. These correlations are explained mainly by the sector and by geographic similarities. Moreover, our highlight the higher vulnerability of small communities and small firms, which is explained by the disassortative mixing of the production network. 2017 Krichene et al.

"McKillop, N.; Brown, S.; Johnson, I.; Smallbone, S.; Ogilvie, J.M.",Can systemic interventions designed to reduce reoffending by youth also reduce their victimization,"Previous research indicates considerable overlap between populations of boys who are victimized and boys who victimize others. This study was concerned with whether a systems-focused treatment program designed to address individual and systemic risk factors associated with the perpetration of sexual and violent crimes might also be successful in reducing boys’ victimization by others. Boys adjudicated for sexual offences who received treatment as usual’ (TAU 335) were compared with similarly adjudicated boys who completed the treatment program (n 200) on their histories of contact with police either as offenders or victims. Despite their higher rates of pre-intervention victimization, the treatment group were victimized less frequently post-intervention than the TAU group. Continued offending was the strongest predictor of victimization post-intervention. These findings suggest that offending and victimization share common risk factors that may be addressed simultaneously within offence-focused treatment. 2016, Springer International Publishing.",2017,2017-01-01,3,Journal of Child and Adolescent Trauma,child; human; juvenile; major clinical study; male; male youth offenders; police; risk factor; sexual crime; sexual offending; systemic interventions; victim; victimization; vulnerable population; vulnerable populations,"McKillop, N.

"Cerchiello, P.; Giudici, P.",Categorical network models for systemic risk measurement,"A very important area of financial risk management is systemic risk modelling, which concerns the estimation of the interrelationships between financial institutions, with the aim of establishing which of them are more central and, therefore, more contagious subject to contagion. The aim of this paper is to develop a systemic risk model which, differently from existing ones, employs not only the information contained in financial market prices, but also big data coming from financial tweets. From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a new framework, based on categorical graphical models, that can estimate systemic risks with models based on two different sources: financial markets and financial tweets, and suggest a way to combine them, using a Bayesian approach. From an applied viewpoint, we present the first systemic risk model based on big data, and show that such a model can shed further light on the interrelationships between financial institutions. This can help predicting the level of returns of a bank, conditionally on the others, for example when a shock occurs in another bank. 2016, Springer Science Business Media Dordrecht.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Quality and Quantity,continuous and discrete graphical models; financial risk management; twitter data analysis,"Cerchiello, P.

"Ozdenoren, E.; Yuan, K.",Contractual externalities and systemic risk,"We study effort and risk-taking behaviour in an economy with a continuum of principal-agent pairs where each agent exerts costly hidden effort. Principals write contracts based on both absolute and relative performance evaluations (APE and RPE, respectively) to make individually optimal risk-return trade-offs but do not take into account their impact on endogenously determined aggregate variables. This in contractual externalities when these aggregate variables are used as benchmarks in contracts. Contractual externalities have welfare changing effects when principals put too much weight on APE or RPE due to information frictions. Relative to the second best, if the expected productivity is high, risk-averse principals over-incentivize their own agents, triggering a rat race in effort exertion, resulting in over-investment in effort and excessive exposure to industry risks. The opposite occurs when the expected productivity is low, inducing pro-cyclical investment and risk-taking behaviours.

"Glova, J.; Dancaková, D.",Country equity risk modelling using dynamic capital asset pricing model in selected central and eastern european countries,"The purpose of this paper is to empirically estimate country beta in a group of five selected CEE countries with an appropriately fitted model that accurately estimates the time-varying characteristics of beta. In methodological part we apply the multiple linear regression model and time-series autoregressive model, as well as statistical approaches for processing the secondary data. The paper finds that there is the existence of dynamic beta model within these countries that considers local as well as global economic effect. Global effects are more significant for the particular model we derived in the paper, and so this study also helps to determine the country risk with respect to the global index and global financial market variables. This paper reliably estimates country betas for the selected CEE countries. The time-varying beta is estimated using unanticipated time-series autoregressive errors embedded in the multiple linear regression models which is rarely applied in the literature. 2018, ASERS Publishing House.

Accumulating evidence links phagocytic signaling in the heart to cardiac development, adult myocardial homeostasis, and the resolution of cardiac inflammation of infectious, ischemic, and aging-associated etiology. Phagocytic clearance in the heart may be carried out by professional phagocytes, such as macrophages, and non-professional cells, including myofibrolasts and potentially epithelial cells. During cardiac development, phagocytosis initiates growth cues for early cardiac morphogenesis. In diseases of aging, including myocardial infarction, heightened levels of cell death require efficient phagocytic debridement to salvage further loss of terminally differentiated adult cardiomyocytes. Additional risk factors, including insulin resistance and other systemic risk factors, contribute to inefficient phagocytosis, altered phagocytic signaling, and delayed cardiac inflammation resolution. Under such conditions, inflammatory presentation of myocardial antigen may lead to autoimmunity and even possible rejection of transplanted heart allografts.

Design methodology approach: The authors propose a set of five overarching rules, informed by history, empirical evidence and theory, which would serve as the foundation on which detailed legislation should be constructed. Findings: The authors find that the current framework governing emergency lending including reforms to Federal Reserve lending enacted after the recent crisis is inadequate and not credible, and that their proposed framework would constitute a credible balancing of costs and benefits. Practical implications: Adequate assistance to financial institutions would be provided in systemic crises but would be limited in its form, and by the process that would govern its provision.

"Yao, Y.; Li, J.; Zhu, X.; Wei, L.",Expected default based score for identifying systemically important banks,"The issue of identifying systemically important banks has gained prominence since the recent global financial crisis in 2007. However, the extant methods either neglect the adverse impact on the financial system posed by a bank or ignore the various interactions among banks. To resolve this issue, the of this study is to put forward an expected default based score (EDBS) that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing methods from the perspective of contagion risk. This indicator measures the systemic importance of a bank by calculating the expected bank defaults triggered by its initial failure. In the empirical study, the expected default based score is applied to identify the systemically important banks in the Chinese banking system. Both the quantitative comparison with other major methods and the qualitative evaluation of the Delphi method validate the reliability of the EDBS method. The empirical also demonstrate that interconnectedness among banks is an important and complementary driver of systemic importance in addition to asset size. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017,2017-01-01,6,Economic Modelling,bank risk; contagion risk; systemic risk; systemically important banks,"Yao, Y.

"Piccotti, L.R.",Financial contagion risk and the stochastic discount factor,"provide evidence that financial contagion risk is an important source of the equity risk premium. Banks’ contributions to aggregate financial contagion are estimated in a state space framework and linked to systemic risk. Greater bank connectedness today leads to increased systemic risk12 months later. More contagious banks earn significantly greater risk-adjusted returns than less contagious ones and the tradable high contagion-minus-low contagion bank portfolio is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. Stocks that co-move more strongly with contagious banks have greater expected returns. These are robust to factor model specification, test assets, and time period considered. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017,2017-01-01,13,Journal of Banking and Finance,asset pricing; equity risk premium; financial contagion; state-space modeling; systemic risk,"Piccotti, L.R.

"Shchepeleva, M.A.",Financial contagion: global transmission of systemic risk,"The article studies financial shock transmission mechanisms and cross-country linkages that make it possible. Given increased interconnections around the globe there is general agreement that in recent time financial system has become much more vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The main channels of transmission are trade and financial linkages among nations. The former are more traditional for developing countries while the latter-for developed markets. The appetite of global investors to risk, the level of uncertainty and information asymmetry in the global financial market are also important factors which can influence the magnitude of shock transmission. The article gives an overview of different methods to calculate the risks of financial shock transmission across countries including correlation and volatility analysis, contingent claims analysis, econometric models with a global factor and different types of VAR (VEC). Using the method of forecast error variance decomposition from a vector auto regression, first proposed by F. Diebold and K. Yilmaz to analyze stock markets interconnectedness, the author quantifies directions of financial shock spillovers in equity, government bond and real estate markets. This methodology was applied to 10 countries. It was found that US, Germany and France are the major transmitters of shocks to other countries. The point to a slight difference in the magnitude of transmission in different sectors: stock markets tend to suffer more from spillover effects while government bond markets are more sensitive to internal factors of instability. The article also discusses various approaches to global systemic risk modeling which is a new area of research in recent time. Regulatory reforms which began in the post-crisis period are considered to be a necessary condition to decrease the intensity of financial shocks transmission. Taking into account how fast the shocks spillover across countries, recovery from the recession requires in the first place coordinated policy actions among governments.",2017,2017-01-01,2,World Economy and International Relations,financial regulatory system; financial spillovers; systemic risk; transmission of financial shocks; variance decomposition,"Shchepeleva, M.A. (Bank of Russia, 12, Neglinnaya Str., Moscow, 107016, Russian Federation, MGIMO-University, 76, Vernadskogoprosp, Moscow, 119454, Russian Federation)",https://dx.doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2017-61-1-17-28,https://dx.doi.org/10.20542/0131-2227-2017-61-1-17-28,scopus,2-s2.0-85032949272
"Sui, C.; Yu, J.; Zong, J.",Fire sales of assets triggered by interbank debt default: amplification of risk contagion based on debt and asset similarity,"With focuses on two contagion channels, namely the interbank debt and the external asset similarity, this paper studies the amplification effect of the risk contagion. Firstly, the research framework of two mechanisms is established, in which two mechanisms may simultaneously exist and interact so as to offer reference for studying the amplification effects of multiple contagion mechanisms. Secondly, a new experimental design thought is proposed. Based on the same basic setting, we can separately simulate interbank debt default and fire sale or simulate their coexistence, which can completely eliminate cross effects of two contagion mechanisms and accurately embody their amplification effects. Finally, three groups of experiments are conducted. We analyze the amplification effects of two contagion mechanisms and research the influences of asset price sensitivity coefficient and interbank loan ratio on the amplification effects, which shows that 1) the amplification effects of the coexistence of two contagion mechanism can bring about destructive power much larger than either of them can individually, and therefore the amplification effects of risk contagion should be the main driving force of causing systemic risk. 2) the mutant influence of asset price sensitivity coefficient on fire sale and amplification effects exists, which means that the risk contagion strength of fire sale will constantly become so large as to bring about the accelerating enlargement of amplification effects with the increasing sell-off and sharp price decline. In the early stage of risk contagion, the adequate liquidity and the avoidable fire sale can greatly reduce banking systemic risk. 3) the fluctuating interbank loan ratio plays an limited role in debt default and amplification effects. Unlike the risk contagion of fire sale, the risk contagion of interbank debt default will gradually become diminishing while the loss of the initial shock is absorbed by the earning of default bank with the increasing contagion rounds. 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Using a research-based network analysis tool, we identify vulnerabilities within the multibarrier control system and their corresponding critical control points (CCPs). CCPs represent opportunities for active intervention that produce the greatest improvement to United Kingdom's resilience to future FMD outbreaks. Using an adapted features, events, and processes’ (FEPs) methodology and network analysis, our suggest that movements of animals and goods associated with legal activities significantly influence the system's behavior due to their higher frequency and ability to combine and create scenarios of exposure similar in origin to the U.K. FMD outbreaks of 1967and 2001. The systemic risk assessment highlights areas outside of disease control that are relevant to disease spread.

Seven clergy spouses, five females and two males, participated in semi-structured interviews that utilized narrative inquiry. A consensual, team-based approach to analyzing patterns across the interview transcripts revealed two simultaneous organizing structures relational (intrapersonal, dyadic, and contextual) and temporal (pre-misconduct, during misconduct, and post-misconduct) both of which are derived from an ecosystemic approach to viewing participant experiences. The resulting structure highlights challenges faced by participants, couples, and congregations as well as factors influencing the recovery process. Specifically, findings suggest the need to increase awareness of systemic risk factors for sexual misconduct and to utilize clinical interventions that extend beyond the individual to address marital, familial, and communal distress. The also point to the need for further research examining the means through which sexual misconduct impacts other individuals, relationships, and communities and for a more thorough and encompassing understanding of the overall impact of sexual misconduct by religious leaders. 2017, Springer Science Business Media New York.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Pastoral Psychology,clergy; clergy sexual misconduct; clergy spouse; ecosystemic theory; family relations; resilience,"Kurtz, F.B.

"Hollander, H.",Macroprudential policy with convertible debt,"This paper studies the effectiveness of countercyclical capital requirements and contingent convertible capital (CoCos) in limiting financial instability, and its associated influence on the real economy. To do this,augment both features into a standard business cycle framework with an equity market and a banking sector. The model is calibrated to real U.S. data and used for simulations. The findings suggest that a countercyclical capital adequacy rule and CoCos provide an effective dual approach to macroprudential policy. On the one hand, a capital adequacy rule mitigates the build-up of systemic risk through a capital buffer. On the other hand, CoCos are able to reduce the impact of a sudden decline in bank capital. 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2017,2017-01-01,3,Journal of Macroeconomics,bank capital; bank regulation; basel; contingent convertible debt; dsge,"Hollander, H.

"Bulut, H.",Managing catastrophic risk in agriculture through ex ante subsidized insurance or ex post disaster aid,"We consider a political economy in which government cares about risk-averse farmers' loss of income but incurs political cost if it provides monetary support to farmers. Farmers' expectations of government disaster aid and overconfidence (optimism bias) regarding their risk prevent farmers from purchasing full insurance under actuarially fair rates. Considering this conclusion, government prefers to subsidize farmers' purchases of insurance ex ante rather than solely relying on disaster aid ex post. The resulting subsidy rate depends on the political environment, the degree of systemic risk, the distribution of farmers' risk preferences, and the nature and distribution of farmers' risk perceptions.

"Soula, J.-L.",Measuring heterogeneity in bank liquidity risk: who are the winners and losers,"The 2007 2009 crisis stressed the importance of liquidity for banks. Aggregate liquidity indices provide an account of financial market liquidity conditions. However, these indices do not illustrate how banks individually are affected by such conditions. Similarly, balance sheet indicators only reflect degrees of potential bank exposure to liquidity shocks. Using a risk factor model, we present a way of measuring bank sensitivity to liquidity risk. Our indicate that liquidity risk is a specific risk, and we shed light on heterogeneities among banks in terms of their exposure to liquidity risk. Liquidity conditions can hinder or benefit banks, and banks can also be insensitive to such conditions. We document large variations in exposure levels across the 2008 and 2011 crises. Larger size and higher capital levels insulate banks from aggregate liquidity risk. However, deposit shares, wholesale funding reliance and funding gaps affect only those banks benefiting from aggregate liquidity risk. These ratios reveal bank liquidity production levels. This suggests that market discipline applies to liquidity production, but only for less risky banks in cases of liquidity crisis. Thus, market discipline appears to be one-sided. This reinforces the necessity of liquidity requirements for all banks as illustrated from the Basel III liquidity ratios. 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",2017,2017-01-01,7,Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,bank risk management; liquidity risk; systemic risk,"Soula, J.-L.

"Karaś, M.; Szczepaniak, W.",Measuring systemic risk with covar using a stock market data based approach,"The aim of the paper is to present and discuss an alternative method of calculating the CoVaR of the banking system. The authors build and empirically utilise the measure of systemic risk, which is based on the traditional CoVaR approach, as proposed by Adrian and Brunenmeier (CoVaR. Staff Report No. 348, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2008 revised September 2014 CoVaR. NBER Working Paper No. 17454, National Bureau of Economic Research, 2011 Am Econ Rev 106:1705 1741, 2016), but uses market-based data (instead of the book values) for calculation. The assumptions of this method, among all else are that 1) the aspects of systemic risk which closely relate to financial system stability, for relatively small financial systems, where the banking sector is the main provided of funding and liquidity, may be modelled with banking-sector-based methods and 2) the stock market is efficient enough to price the risk related to those financial institutions, whose stocks are quoted on the relevant stock exchange. The empirical research is carried on the example of Poland, as in the authors opinion, also following the literature, the two mentioned assumptions hold for this particular country. The paper concludes with ideas for future research, including further development of the proposed method to include institutions other than banks, and a range of other central European countries for which this method is applicable. 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",2017,2017-01-01,6,Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics,banking sector; covar; systemic risk; value at risk,"Karaś, M.

"Cheng, X.; Shaoyi, L.S.; Hua, Z.",Measuring the systemic importance of interconnected industries in the world economic system,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to measure the systemic importance of industry in the world economic system under the system-wide eventthe crisis of 2008-2009, by viewing this system as a weighted directed network of interconnected industries. Design methodology approachFirst, the authors investigate this crisis at three different levels based on network-related indicators: the ""macro"" global level, the ""meso"" country level, and the ""micro"" industry level. This investigation not only provides evidence for the systemic influence, that is, systemic risk, of the crisis, but also reveals the contagion mechanism of the crisis, which supports the stress testing. Second, the authors use a network-related business intelligence algorithm, the combined hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, to measure the contribution of a given individual industry to the overall risk of the economic system or, in other words, the systemic importance of the individual industry. FindingsThe HITS algorithm considers both the market information and the interconnectedness of the industries. Based on the stress testing, the performance of the combined HITS is compared with the purely market-based systemic risk measurement. The show that the combined HITS outperforms the baseline in finding the topsystemically important industries. Practical implicationsThe combined HITS algorithm provides a novel network-based perspective of systemic risk measurement. Originality valueMeasuring the systemic importance based on the combined HITS algorithm can help managers and regulators design effective risk management policies. In this respect, the work initiates a research direction of studying the systemic risk in a business system based on a network-related business intelligence algorithm because the business system can be viewed as an interconnected network.

"Guo, W.; Szeto, K.Y.",Minimization of systemic risk for directed network using genetic algorithm,"In directed networks, flow dynamics may lead to cascade failures due to node and link removal. The systemic risk in financial systems follows similar mechanism, where banks are connected by interbank linkages with money transfers. A mathematical model of the banking network is used to investigate the relationships between the cascade dynamics and key parameters determining the banking network structure, including the connectivity, the bank’s capitalization, and the size of interbank exposure, based on analytical calculations and numerical simulations. To optimize the network topology for the minimization of systemic risk, genetic algorithm is applied to evolve the network. It is observed that the systemic risk of financial system could be decreased by increasing the degree variance of the associated network. This could be useful for financial risk management, with possible applications to other physical systems such as ecological web, where the network stability is also an important issue.

Academic works struggle to integrate the spatiality and temporality of risk and crisis. This paper argues that drawing upon the notion of vulnerability allows for a multiscalar and, hence, more thorough, approach in terms of space and time. However, this approach is also challenged by the globalization of certain threats. The transformation of these threats into global and systemic risks calls for a new conceptual framework. Thus, this paper intends to give due consideration to the spatialities and temporalities of ""global risk"" in order to consider vulnerability both from a cross-scale and a transcalar perspective.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Espace-populations-societes,crossscaled approach; embedded scale; global risk; large-scale risk; local/global; multiscalar approach; spatial scale; systemic risk; temporal scale; temporality; vulnerability,"Reghezza-Zitt, M.

"Mezei, J.; Sarlin, P.",Possibilistic clustering for crisis prediction: systemic risk states and membership degrees,"Research on understanding and predicting systemic financial risk has been of increasing importance in the recent years. A common approach is to build predictive models based on macro-financial vulnerability indicators to identify systemic risk at an early stage. In this article, we outline an approach for identifying different systemic risk states through possibilistic fuzzy clustering. Instead of directly using a supervised classification method, we aim at identifying coherent groups of vulnerability with macro-financial indicators for pre-crisis data, and determine the level of risk for a new observation based on its similarity to the identified groups. The approach allows for differentiating among different possible pre-crisis states, and using this information for estimating the possibility of systemic risk. In this work, we compare different fuzzy clustering methods, as well as conduct an empirical exercise for European systemic banking crises. 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

The article establishes that PPP structures in India cannot achieve the desired of optimal risk sharing and mitigation in the light of lack of suitably priced instruments to mitigate political, regulatory and legal risks. Thus, expected cash flows for repayment do not build up. This in a problem of over-leverage and subsequent decline in the asset quality of the banking book.

"Skinner, C.P.",Regulating nonbanks: A plan for SIFI lite,"This Article examines a relatively recent addition to the institutional architecture of financial regulation in the United States: the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). In particular, it draws attention to a flaw in the design of the FSOC's power to designate nonbank financial companies as ""systemically important"" financial institutions, commonly known as ""SIFIs."" Specifically, the Article argues that the binary nature of the designation power has underappreciated costs, which hinder the FSOC's stability goals. This Article makes both positive and normative claims. First, it sheds light on the ways a binary designation power incentivizes certain financial institution behavior, such as litigation and restructuring. A binary designation power can also influence regulatory behavior by creating an opportunity for politicized decision making. This Article highlights the social and economic costs of these behaviors, which include the potential for underinclusive supervisory scope, increased information asymmetries, and distorted business decisions. Such costs can undermine the SIFI stability agenda as well as financial institution efficiency. Second, in teasing out the normative implications of that cost analysis, the Article argues for a more marginal-nuanced-apparatus for regulating nonbank financial institutions. In doing so, this Article also probes the broader question of whether the entity-based paradigm is the most effective regulatory strategy for appraising and addressing systemic risk in the nonbank arena. Ultimately, by exploring how SIFI policy should be revised to reflect these normative insights, this Article develops a broader theory about post-Crisis regulatory design-that regulators have undervalued supervision, and the information it produces, as a tool for systemic risk management outside the traditional banking system. 2017, Christina Parajon Skinner.",2017,2017-01-01,6,Georgetown Law Journal,,"Skinner, C.P.

For each country we consider, as a target measure, the Debt GDP ratio. We model the time dynamics of both the Debt and the GDP by means of a linear combination of two stochastic equations: an Euro Area systematic process and a country-specific idiosyncratic process. Doing so, we provide an early warning predictive model of sovereign debt sustainability, considering both the financial and the real economy sides, and in terms of both common and country-specific factors. We provide an estimation procedure for the parameters of the processes, which allows to calculate the implied probabilities of default for each country. The empirical findings show a clear clustering effect between northern and southern countries, especially on the financial side. The inclusion of the GDP growth rate in the derivation of default probabilities partially changes the clustering structure, showing that the sovereign risk of some countries (especially that of France and Italy) is strongly affected not only by the debt evolution, but also by the growth of the GDP. 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2017,2017-01-01,8,Quantitative Finance,correlated stochastic processes; debt/gdp ratio; systemic risk,"Giudici, P.

We find that while financial sector leverage contains additional information about the state of the economy that is not captured in inflation and output leaning against financial variables can only marginally improve welfare because rules are detrimental in the presence of falling asset prices. An optimal macroprudential policy, similar to a counter cyclical capital requirement, can eliminate systemic risk raising welfare by about 1.5%.

"Hurd, T.R.",The construction and properties of assortative configuration graphs,"In the new field of financial systemic risk, the network of interbank counterparty relationships can be described as a directed random graph. In cascade models of systemic risk, this skeleton acts as the medium through which financial contagion is propagated. It has been observed in real networks that such counterparty relationships exhibit negative assortativity, meaning that a bank’s counterparties are more likely to have unlike characteristics. This paper introduces and studies a general class of random graphs called the assortative configuration model, parameterized by an arbitrary node-type distributionand edge-type distribution Q. The first main result is a law of large numbers that says the empirical edge-type distributions converge in probability toas the number of nodesgoes to infinity. The second main result is a formula for the largeasymptotic probability distribution of general graphical objects called configurations.

"Tsai, C.-H.; Peng, K.-J.",The fintech revolution and financial regulation: the case of online supply-chain financing,"Online supply-chain financing has been a relatively novel funding channel for suppliers as small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to obtain loans in that the revolution of financial technology (FinTech) transforms traditional supply-chain financing, which used to be administered only by official banks, to an online model also used by electronic commerce platforms (e-commerce platform). Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-Touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime.

"Patriarca, R.; Di, G.G.; Costantino, F.; Tronci, M.",The functional resonance analysis method for a systemic risk based environmental auditing in a sinter plant: A semi-quantitative approach,"Environmental auditing is a main issue for any production plant and assessing environmental performance is crucial to identify risks factors. The complexity of current plants arises from interactions among technological, human and organizational system components, which are often transient and not easily detectable. The auditing thus requires a systemic perspective, rather than focusing on individual behaviors, as emerged in recent research in the safety domain for socio-technical systems. We explore the significance of modeling the interactions of system components in everyday work, by the application of a recent systemic method, i.e. the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), in order to define dynamically the system structure. We present also an innovative evolution of traditional FRAM following a semi-quantitative approach based on Monte Carlo simulation. This paper represents the first contribution related to the application of FRAM in the environmental context, moreover considering a consistent evolution based on Monte Carlo simulation. The case study of an environmental risk auditing in a sinter plant validates the research, showing the benefits in terms of identifying potential critical activities, related mitigating actions and comprehensive environmental monitoring indicators. 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2017,2017-01-01,53,Environmental Impact Assessment Review,environmental audit; environmental auditing; environmental contexts; environmental engineering; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; environmental impact assessments; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental performance; environmental risk; environmental risks; functional resonance; functional resonance analysis methods (fram); innovation; intelligent systems; monte carlo analysis; monte carlo methods; monte carlo simulation; quantitative analysis; resonance; risk assessment; safety; seismic survey; sinter; sintering; sociotechnical systems,"Patriarca, R.

The systemic risk is measured by Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and SRISK. Using panel regression, we find that systemic risk measured by MES has a positive relationship with bank size, but it has inverse relationship with capital using both MES and SRISK. However, the funding structure has a small effect on systemic risk compare to size and capital.

(J Econ Dyn Control 31(6):2033 2060, 2007. http: www.bankofengland.co.uk publications workingpapers wp346.pdf) to inhomogeneous networks. We preserve the convenient description of a financial system using a sparsely parameterized random graph, but add several relevant inhomogeneities. These include well-connected banks, financial institutions with disproportionately large interbank assets, and big banks that focus on wholesale and retail customers. These extensions significantly enhance the model’s generality as they reflect realistic inhomogeneities that have a potentially decisive impact on a system’s stability. We find that large and well-connected banks have a surprisingly modest impact. However, institutions with disproportionately large interbank assets significantly increase the risk of contagion in networks. Moreover, these effects can be partly compensated by a redistribution of equity capital, even without increasing the total amount. However, the level of regulatory capital should be defined according to the interbank market position of a bank, and not the size of the bank. 2017, Springer Science Business Media New York.",2017,2017-01-01,6,Annals of Operations Research,banking system; capital buffers; contagion; contagious defaults; financial system stability; inhomogeneities; network models; systemic risk,"Hübsch, A.

Firstly, an analysis is made on how fiscal policy may become unsustainable, whether it is due to a worsening of the fundamentals of a country, or to increasing international financial turmoil. Particular attention is paid to the literature on the role of financial institutions and their sovereign links in a crisis context. This link may mean that sovereign stress is transferred to the banks, via holdings of sovereign debt or vice versa, on account of the implicit (or explicit) guarantee that banks may have from the sovereign. Secondly, a review is made of the determining factors of the connectedness amongst financial institutions and between sovereign banks. The indicators of connectedness can help understand how systemic risk builds up. Finally, an analysis is made on how the debate on macro-prudential policy has evolved to tackle the issue of system-wide financial stress. 2016 AsociaciCuadernos de Econom a",2017,2017-01-01,1,Cuadernos De Economia,financial crisis; macro-prudential; sovereign debt; systemic risk,"Echevarria Icaza, V.

"Brummer, C.",The renminbi and systemic risk,"The internationalization of China's currency, the renminbi (RMB), is arising in ways that depart considerably from historical precedent and what 'law and macroeconomic' theory would predict. Instead of waiting for international markets for its currency to evolve organically, the Chinese government has undertaken a quasi-mercantilist strategy designed to promote the currency and its own national RMB-based infrastructure. This strategy has emphasized tightly managed capital account deregulation over prudential reforms and robust market supervision, and incentivizes foreign jurisdictions to compete for RMB-based transactions. China's monetary strategy introduces novel systemic risks to the global financial system, including a potentially inadequate provision of renminbi liquidity, a regulatory race to the bottom between offshore RMB-hubs, and significant transmission belts of financial risk to even non-renminbi markets. To mitigate these risks, this Article outlines a policy recipe of stronger macroprudential oversight, transparent countercyclical capital account reforms and credible commitments to refrain from competitive currency devaluations. 2017 The Author.",2017,2017-01-01,3,Journal of International Economic Law,,"Brummer, C.

"Brinkman, J.T.","Thinking like a lawyer in an uncertain world: the politics of climate, law and risk governance in the united states","This article explores the legal aspects of risk governance using the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. Legal ways of thinking based on realist risk conceptions requiring a showing of simple causation before granting relief may derail efforts to address uncertainty. Courts filter risk questions through legal procedures and epistemologies to become legal-scientific risk conceptions. At the same time, lawyers and judges have disproportionate power in violation of the normative goals of risk governance. Furthermore, litigation narrows the number of concepts and parties while adding complexity to already uncertain and multifaceted risks.argue that the majority's reasoning in Massachusetts v. EPA suggests that judges can make existing legal mechanisms more responsive to risk governance by incorporating the judicial precautionary principle into case law. This subtle insertion of the precautionary principle into precedent governing legal standing tempered aspects of the law that made responding to systemic risks more difficult. The dissenting opinions reveal underlying ambivalences towards globalization that could impact whether institutions choose to confront systemic risks.argue that changes in legal culture can lead to risk governance within existing regulatory systems, in contrast to those scholars who advocate for radically new governance regimes. 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017,2017-01-01,3,Energy Research and Social Science,climate change; environmental law; massachusetts v. epa; risk governance,"Brinkman, J.T.

In contrast to previous studies which estimate the correlations between different time series, dTWGA can be used to analyse time series with different lengths and with data sampled unevenly. Moreover, since coupling between different time series or at different periods of time would be changing over time, the time delay for the influence of a time series to reach another time series would be changing as well, which would not be well captured with correlation measurements. The proposed algorithm is applied on Dow Jones Index (DJI) and its compositions consisting of 30 stocks, and different measurements are performed to observe the evolution of the network structure. It is suggested that there are major topological changes during market crashes, leading to a significant decrease in the size of the network.

"Seele, P.; Chesney, M.",Toxic sustainable companies: a critique on the shortcomings of current corporate sustainability ratings and a definition of financial toxicity’,"Building on critical literature on corporate sustainability, we add a perspective thus far only scarcely addressed: the toxicity of financial practices and products generating systemic risk. We start with illustrative examples setting the stage for defining toxic assets and practices as revealed after the onset of the financial crisis precipitated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. To illustrate corporate toxicity we use the Global 100 Index’ from Corporate Knights’ to show which (mostly financial) scandals or bailout cases were detected at corporations awarded a position in this prestigious sustainability rating. Next, we present examples of toxic products (Naked Credit Default Swaps and structured products) and practices (securitization and ratings). Based on the examples we derive the concept of financial toxicity’ adopted from pharmacology as a meta-criterion, which, as we argue, should be added to the ESG (environment, society, governance) universe as well as to corporate social responsibility and Corporate Sustainability. We define financial toxicity as the degree to which financial products can systematically harm their buyers and, on a large scale, the extent to which these products or financial practices generate systemic risk’.

"Zitrou, A.; Bedford, T.; Walls, L.",A model for availability growth with application to new generation offshore wind farms,"A model for availability growth is developed to capture the effect of systemic risk prior to construction of a complex system. The model has been motivated by new generation offshore wind farms where investment decisions need to be taken before test and operational data are available. We develop a generic model to capture the systemic risks arising from innovation in evolutionary system designs. By modelling the impact of major and minor interventions to mitigate weaknesses and to improve the failure and restoration processes of subassemblies, we are able to measure the growth in availability performance of the system. We describe the choices made in modelling our particular industrial setting using an example for a typical UK Round III offshore wind farm. We obtain point estimates of the expected availability having populated the simulated model using appropriate judgemental and empirical data. We show the relative impact of modelling systemic risk on system availability performance in comparison with estimates obtained from typical system availability modelling assumptions used in offshore wind applications. While modelling growth in availability is necessary for meaningful decision support in developing complex systems such as offshore wind farms, we also discuss the relative value of explicitly articulating epistemic uncertainties. 2015 The Authors.

"Bobtcheff, C.; Chaney, T.; Gollier, C.",Analysis of systemic risk in the insurance industry,"In this paper, we discuss the systemic relevance of the insurance sector. Systemic risk is defined as the propensity of a financial institution to be undercapitalised when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalised. By the law of large numbers, traditional lines of insurance with idiosyncratic non-catastrophic risks cannot be systemic. On the contrary, undiversified insurers specialised in activities whose insured risks are highly correlated with GDP are systemic. In the life insurance sector, some contractual clauses such as unhedged minimum guarantees and free options to surrender raise the chance of systemic relevance. On the contrary, life insurers satisfying the classic solvency capital requirements contribute to the liquidity of financial markets thanks to the long-termist approach of their portfolio management. Finally, using historical data in the U.S. on the contribution of different sectors to the aggregate volatility of the economy, we show that investment banking is almost twice as volatile as aggregate GDP, while insurance is one fifth as volatile as aggregate GDP. The insurance sector thus appears to be a stabilising force of the economy. 2016 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.",2016,2016-01-01,4,Geneva Risk and Insurance Review,,"Bobtcheff, C.

This paper investigates behavioral responses to a natural hazard (flooding) by examining residential property values. The of this investigation can be used to develop benefit cost studies to assess the economic merits of policies that mitigates the risk of floods by using the residential housing market as a proxy for estimating these values since the choice of where to live often includes the choice of hazard level. The methodology described here also provides a mechanism for testing consumer behavior under uncertainty. This study uses a hedonic property price function to estimate the effects of flood hazards on residential property values. The study utilizes data from 158,890 residential home sales in Dublin, Ireland between 2006 and 2015. This area experienced significant flooding in October 2011. GIS is used to spatially characterize the houses included in the analysis by linking them to the following set of parameters included into the baseline regression: house price, house type and size (number of bedrooms and bathrooms), when it was on the market, and its location. Once the baseline regression model is built, then the variables included in it are regressed against the flood-risk. The distance between a set of amenities and the properties is also calculated using GIS. show that a house located within a floodplain has a lower market value than an equivalent house located outside the floodplain.

"Bougheas, S.; Kirman, A.","Bank insolvencies, priority claims and systemic risk","We review an extensive literature debating the merits of alternative priority structures for banking liabilities put forward by financial economists, legal scholars and policymakers. Up to now, this work has focused exclusively on the relative advantages of each group of creditors to monitor the activities of bankers. We argue that systemic risk is another dimension that this discussion must include. The main message of our work is that when bank failures are contagious then when regulators assign priority rights need also to take into account how the bankruptcy resolution of one institution might affect the survival of other institutions that have acted as its creditors. When the network structure is fixed the solution is straightforward. Other banks should have priority to minimize the risk of their downfall. However, if the choice of policy can affect the structure of the network, policy design becomes more complex. This is a fruitful avenue for future research.

"Cybo-Ottone, A.; Savorelli, L.",Banking and insurance recapitalization during the 2007-2009 credit crisis,"This paper explores the feedback loop between the intensity of financial intermediary recapitalization and a number of measures of credit and liquidity risk. We cover the entire 2007-2009 subprime crisis with a sample that includes the 97 largest banks and insurance companies on both sides of the Atlantic. We model the intensity of recapitalization by implementing a scale measure inspired by the Corrective Action system used by U.S. banking regulators. The proposed ordering starts with inaction, followed by dividend cuts, to issues of new equity, to bailouts. Our risk measures include toxic asset exposures, credit default swap spreads, and Merton-style probabilities of default. We show that there is a monotone relationship between the intensity of risk and the intensity of recapitalization across all firms and jurisdictions in the sample. We are able to simplify the large heterogeneity of regulations and business models across sectors and countries within a fairly simple and general classification scheme. This scheme distinguishes between individual bailouts, targeted at bankruptcy prevention, and more nuanced collective bailouts, which were more related to the prevention of systemic risk arising from potentially solvent institutions. 2016 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.",2016,2016-01-01,0,Economic Notes,banking; capital; credit provision; debt crisis; insurance system,"Cybo-Ottone, A.

In our model contagion risk arises as a result of the individual idiosyncratic failure of each bank in the banking system. Following Guerrero-Gomez and Lopez-Gallo (2004), we use a sequential default algorithm that is useful for tracing the path of contagion from a trigger bank to other banks during several contagion rounds. We test different types of limits on inter-SIB (systematically important banks) exposures, SIB to non-SIB exposures, and non-SIB to all other banks and we study three different assumptions about banks’ behavioural responses under a stricter regulatory lending regime. We also stress test all banks within the banking system and extend the analysis on the benefits of using tighter limits in a fragile banking system. Calibrating the model to Mexican banking sector data, this network model shows that tighter limits for inter-SIB exposures are a useful tool for reducing contagion risk. Moreover, we find that tighter limits may lead to an increase in contagion risk under specific allocation assumptions. 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2016,2016-01-01,18,Journal of Financial Stability,financial contagion; large exposures limit; network models; systemic risk; systemically important banks (sibs),"Batiz-Zuk, E.

We test the hypothesis that the predictive performance of binomial logit models is hampered by what we define as the crisis duration bias, arising from the decision to either treat crisis years after the onset of a crisis as non-crisis years or remove them altogether from the sample. In line with our hypothesis, from a large sample of world economies suggest that i) the multinomial logit outperforms the binomial logit model in predicting systemic banking crises, and ii) the longer the average duration of the crisis in the sample, the larger the improvement. 2016.",2016,2016-01-01,33,Journal of Empirical Finance,banking crises; early warning systems; financial regulation; logit estimation; systemic risk,"Caggiano, G.

"Cont, R.; Minca, A.",Credit default swaps and systemic risk,"We present a network model for investigating the impact on systemic risk of central clearing of over the counter (OTC) credit default swaps (CDS). We model contingent cash flows resulting from CDS and other OTC derivatives by a multi-layered network with a core-periphery structure, which is flexible enough to reproduce the gross and net exposures as well as the heterogeneity of market shares of participating institutions. We analyze illiquidity cascades resulting from liquidity shocks and show that the contagion of illiquidity takes place along a sub-network constituted by links identified as ’critical receivables’. A key role is played by the long intermediation chains inherent to the structure of the OTC network, which may turn into chains of critical receivables. We calibrate our model to data representing net and gross OTC exposures of large dealer banks and use this model to investigate the impact of central clearing on network stability. We find that, when interest rate swaps are cleared, central clearing of credit default swaps through a well-capitalized CCP can reduce the probability and the magnitude of a systemic illiquidity spiral by reducing the length of the chains of critical receivables within the financial network. These benefits are reduced, however, if some large intermediaries are not included as clearing members. 2015, Springer Science Business Media New York.",2016,2016-01-01,28,Annals of Operations Research,credit default swaps; financial crisis; financial networks; financial stability; intermediation chains; multi-layered network; systemic risk,"Cont, R.

While leverage is oftentimes linked to the vulnerability of a nation, the stock of total debt and the flow of gross savings is a less explored measure. Cash flows certainly have a well-known connection to corporations' ability to service debt. This paper investigates whether theCF provides a means for understanding systemic risks. For a panel of 33 nations, we explore historicCF trends and apply the same procedure to economic sectors. In terms of an early-warning indicator, we show that theCF ratio provides a useful additional measure of vulnerability to systemic banking and sovereign crises, relative to more conventional indicators.

"Coispeau, O.",Finance masters: A brief history of international financial centers in the last millennium,"One thousand years ago, a handful of dynamic medieval city states developed trade at the frontier of capitalism. Their unique commercial ambition led to the emergence of finance capitals of international significance: Finance Masters. From the 11th century onward, international financial hubs, led by astute and bold merchant bankers and visionary leaders, inspired the numerous innovations that triggered economic revolutions in the last millennium and laid the ground for modern finance. This book explores not only classic financial centers, but also offshore financial centers and gambling centers to connect them to contemporary finance, and it also delves into the unique function of leading financial hubs to execute financial transactions over a wide geographical domain and transform the world economy. The 2008-2009 Great Recession showed that working on fundamental issues such as market structure, pricing mechanism, and games was indeed necessary but probably still insufficient to create the antibodies needed to mitigate systemic risk and prevent the irrational exuberance capable of triggering devastating economic crash. In the continuation of the Theory of Moral Sentiments written by Adam Smith in 1759, seventeen years before his Wealth of Nations, it seems a deeper historical understanding of the key success factors which quietly assembled in the backyard of our market economy can be a useful lifeline. This book aims to explain the widening gulf that emerged over time between economics, regulatory and ethical considerations necessary to a smoother functioning of markets. Finance Masters is also a book about the extraordinary men who led the evolution of modern finance with the innovations that changed the course of economic history. This book tries to capture the salient factors behind the geography of finance hubs from the early fairs in medieval England and Venice to Wall Street in contemporary New York. The development and the legacy of those Finance Masters deserve more attention to reflect upon the evolution of incumbent players and better understand their possible future.

Though the theoretical and structural aspects of core periphery networks are clear, the consequences that core periphery structures bring for banking efficiency stand as an open question. We address this gap in the literature by providing insights as to how the structure of financial networks can affect bank efficiency. We find that core periphery structures are cost efficient for banks, which is a characteristic that encourages the participation of banks in financial networks. On the downside, we also show that core periphery structures are risk-taking inefficient, because they imply higher systemic risk levels in the financial system. In this way, regulators should be aware of the excessive risk inefficiency that arises in the financial system due to individual decisions made by banks in the network. 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,2016-01-01,41,Journal of Financial Stability,core–periphery; efficiency; financial network; interconnectivity; risk,"Silva, T.C.

"Abrol, S.; Chesir, B.; Mehta, N.","High frequency trading and US stock market microstructure: A study of interactions between complexities, risks and strategies residing ins equity market microstructure","We examine the conditions, complexities and risks of a fragmented market microstructure to contextualize the role of algorithmic and high frequency trading in the US equity markets. The establishment of a national market system and Regulation NMS was meant to promote competition, recognizing the evolution and changing dynamics introduced by technological innovation. This evolution and governing rule set has had many positive effects in terms of competition, fee compression, tighter spread potential and volumes. Our paper identifies certain unintended consequences and complexities of the national market system including fragmentation, sub second quoting and trading, complex order types, data asymmetry, technological innovation, unique strategies and the algorithms that power them. When acting in concert, these complexities give rise to opportunities as well as emerging risks. This high-speed system can be unstable and susceptible to inherent conflicts of interest, market abuse and price shocks. These shocks can be amplified by positive feedback loops accelerating single stock declines and also posing systemic risks in time scales beyond real-time physical human comprehension and reaction times. Furthermore they can produce contagion, which we refer to as 'Flash Splashes' caused by rapid withdrawals and injections of liquidity in increasingly linked asset classes, indices, sectors and global liquidity pools. High frequency trading strategies can be both passive and aggressive and usually display risk averse and low inventory characteristics. These strategies leverage fragmentation as they create or capture informational asymmetries. They interact directly with sell side algorithms that can hide intentions, hunt liquidity and sweep the order book. These interactions create market dynamics that can benefit and challenge anyone exposed to US equity markets. Every market participant has a risk profile unique to their strategy and and while regulations will be enriched or revised and certain unfair practices eliminated great attention should be paid to understanding modern high speed trading risks and both the positive and negative impacts on all stakeholders. We have examined the regulations, complexities and risks to bring clarity and understanding to the current trading ecosystem for its users.2016 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016,2016-01-01,7,"Financial Markets, Institutions and Instruments",,"Abrol, S.

"Raghavan, S.S.",Impact of demand response on electric vehicle charging and day ahead market operations,"The orderly transition of the current electricity grid to a smarter grid facilitates the demand side to increasingly play a proactive role. Enabling technologies within the smart grid framework play a crucial role in alleviating systemic risks associated with capacity shortages, electricity price volatility and congestion by controlling end user electricity consumption through demand response (DR). With the impending large scale adoption of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), DR becomes even more important to ensure the utilities are adequately prepared to manage the incremental demand imposed by PEV (Plug in hybrid and pure electric vehicle) charging. This paper evaluates the impact of scheduling the incremental demand imposed by the PEV on day ahead market operations. The function is to maximize the ISO (Independent System Operator) net surplus. Standard DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) for the ISO managed day ahead market operations is formulated subject to generation capacity, power balance and transmission line constraints. In the base case simulations, the impact of demand bid elasticity on locational marginal prices (LMPs) and ISO net surplus is evaluated for abus system. For two PEV penetration (10000 and 50000 PEVs) scenarios and three charging profiles (evening, off-peak and uniform), the impact of PEV charging on LMP, GENCO revenues and LSE payments are evaluated. Preliminary indicate that percentage increment of the LSE payment vary from 0.6% to 12% over the baseline and LMP increment varies between 0.3 to 10%, depending on the time of charging and the size of the PEV fleet. It was also observed that by incorporating demand bid elasticity, more PEVs can be charged without causing an appreciable increase in the LMPs. 2016 IEEE.",2016,2016-01-01,7,"2016 Ieee Power and Energy Conference at Illinois, Peci 2016",charging (batteries); commerce; costs; crashworthiness; demand response; elasticity; electric load flow; electric power transmission; electric power transmission networks; electric utilities; electric vehicle charging; electricity price volatilities; electricity-consumption; independent system operators; locational marginal prices; pev charging; plug-in electric vehicles; plug-in hybrid vehicles; price elasticity; smart grid; smart power grids; vehicles,"Raghavan, S.S.

"Vučinić, M.",Importance of macroprudential policy implementation for safeguarding financial stability,"The crisis pointed to the necessity for strong and stable financial system resistant to potential risks and shocks. Macroprudential policy is used to identify, monitor and asses systemic risks to financial stability. Therefore, it is very important to create effective and efficient macroprudential policy. To achieve this, it is crucial to create a strong institutional framework. This paper deals with the importance of macroprudential policy for financial system stability. The first part of the paper explains the macroprudential policy and its connection with other economic policies. The second part refers to the necessity of building strong institutional framework and the importance of providing clear responsibilities for macroprudential policy, as long as precise determination of responsibilities is very suggested and important for further functioning and policy implementation.

"Tarter, A.",Intelligent monitoring and control: essential guidance for critical infrastructure security,"Energy companies recognize that they have become high-value targets and that their operations can be disrupted using only cyber means. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and Process Control Systems (PCS) are of specific interest to attackers as these operate critical infrastructure. Risk management is extremely difficult because every risk has a high cost attached and there are no reliable statistics to assess the likelihood of a risk occurring. The challenge is to understand an organization's risk profile and tailor its risk management strategy accordingly. Industrial networks facilitate the free flow of messages that can allow poison packets to transmit with potentially disastrous effect. For instance, Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) Secure Authentication does not protect against implementation failures in the device that can be exploited through malformed packets, therefore making protocol-Aware validation and restrictions essential. A comprehensive approach to restricting what can and does occur within an industrial control network will help effectively mitigate the systemic risks that are inherent within the industrial control environment. To comprehensively protect the critical infrastructure that powers civilian businesses and homes, the intelligent approach demands a secure-system design that controls and monitors all entities within the control system from users to vulnerability-prone endpoints and protocols. Not all attacks occur from external sources and so boundary protections such as data-diodes and firewalls are not enough. Such solutions, however, also must preserve operational efficiency to assure that the cure is not worse than the malware, in relation to operational efficiency. Successful risk management requires an effective assessment of the inherent risks and the most viable mitigation strategies for those risks. This paper outlines these systemic industrial control specific cyberrelated risks, and offers an approach for intelligently monitoring and controlling cyber activity to reduce a cyber-related impact. This approach promotes systems-based methods that focus on architectures that leave critical operations uninterrupted.

"Bandivadekar, P.; Gupta, S.; Sharma, N.",Intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage after penetrating keratoplasty: case series and review of literature,"To describe four cases of intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) during penetrating keratoplasty and to review the literature. Methods: Cases with intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty over 3-year period were reviewed. The parameters evaluated were ocular and systemic risk factors, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. A review of literature of intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty was also conducted.Of the 543 cases that underwent penetrating keratoplasty for optical indications during the study period, four cases developed intraoperative SCH, which is an incidence of 0.73%. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurred in the following cases: failed pediatric graft, donor eye in a case of contralateral autokeratoplasty, Marfan syndrome with aphakic bullous keratopathy who had undergone multiple ocular surgeries, and a case of healed keratitis with corneoiridic scar. The mean age, axial length, and intraocular pressure were 32.75 22.17 years (range, 4-57 years), 23.29 2.12 mm (range, 20.38-25.2 mm), and 16.25 3.86 mm Hg (range, 16-20 mm Hg), respectively. Postoperatively, two eyes had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of counting fingers. The third case had BCVA of light perception (LP), and fourth eye had no LP.

We analyze the costs of the intervention and the subsequent increase in value of debt and or equity issued by Irish banks, the Irish government, and European banks with substantial holdings of Irish debt. The total initial value increase around the announcement amounts to 5.59bln at a realized taxpayers’ cost of 4.23bln. While the value increase depends on somewhat generous assumptions, it further increases by 2.8bln up to Ireland's exit in December 2013. About 3.1bln of the value created indirectly supports the European banking sector, indicating that substantial benefits arise from systemic risk containment. 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2016,2016-01-01,2,Journal of Banking and Finance,bailout; european debt crisis; event study; financial stability,"van Bekkum, S.

"Manayath, G.J.; Arora, S.; Parikh, H.; Shah, P.K.; Tiwari, S.; Narendran, V.",Is myopia a protective factor against central serous chorioretinopathy,"AIM: To evaluate if any association exists between central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) and the refractive status of the eye. METHODS: This retrospective, institutional, case control study included 499 patients, wherein 262 patients diagnosed as acute CSCR, were compared with an age and gender matched control group of 237 patients. All patients were evaluated with a detailed systemic and ocular history, and subjective refractions for both eyes and complete ocular examination by a retina specialist, at all visits. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the diagnosis of CSCR.The mean age was found to be 40 7y in the study group (Group 1) compared to 38 10y in the control group (Group 2). Most common refractive status in the study group, was emmetropia seen in 191 patients (72.9%), followed by hypermetropia seen in 47 patients (17.9%) and astigmatism seen in 21 patients (8.0%). Onlysubjects (1.1%) had myopia, which was less than or equal to 1.0 D, compared to 70 subjects (29.5%) in the control group, suggesting a statistically significant lower incidence of CSCR among the myopic patients (P 0.0001). With respect to the systemic factors, 26 (9.9%) patients were using systemic steroids in the study group (Group 1) compared to none in the control group (Group 2) suggesting a statistically significant association of CSCR with systemic steroid use (P 0.05). No other significant systemic risk factors were noted. CONCLUSION: Though CSCR is a multifactorial disease, myopia serves as a protective factor for CSCR. Thus, myopic eyes are less likely to develop CSCR. Since both retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris are postulated in the pathogenesis of CSCR, chorio-retinal thinning and atrophy seen in myopic eyes are less likely to cause CSCR. 2016, International Journal of Ophthalmology (cEditorial Office).

"Sidortsov, R.; Ivanova, A.; Stammler, F.",Localizing governance of systemic risks: A case study of the power of siberia pipeline in russia,"For the past three decades, risk has occupied center stage in the energy discourse. Systemic risks have proven particularly challenging for government energy planners and corporate executives, as they are characterized by their complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity, and ability to causing ripple effects throughout economic, social, and political structures. In this article we analyze two approaches to governing systemic risks arising out of energy megaprojects, one mandated under the Russian legal and regulatory regime and one employed by the largely indigenous hunters, fishermen, and reindeer herders residing in the Sakha Republic. Our study focuses on the 4000-km-long natural gas transmission system ""Power of Siberia"" to be constructed in the sub-Arctic part of the region. We employ a complimentary and corroborative analysis of legal texts, fieldwork observations, semi-structured interviews, and transcripts of official meetings. We establish that the approach to risk taken by the people who occupy the land that the Power of Siberia traverses could provide a useful insight for handling systemic risks in connection with pipeline transportation systems. We also determine that the current Russian legal and regulatory regime fails to provide an adequate basis for governing such risks. We conclude the article by identifying four pathways for integrating valuable elements of the indigenous approach into the current legal and regulatory framework. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Sarlin, P.","Macroprudential oversight, risk communication and visualization","This paper discusses the role of risk communication in macroprudential oversight and of visualization in risk communication. Beyond the increase in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, in addition to internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors. This further stresses the importance of simple representations of complex data. The present paper focuses on the and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube. 2016",2016,2016-01-01,15,Journal of Financial Stability,analytical visualization; interactive visualization; macroprudential oversight; risk communication; visrisk; visualization,"Sarlin, P.

The subject of this study is a new safety management paradigm called resilience engineering. In a dynamic and ever-changing business environment, socio-technical systems are subject to increasing variability. In this article, we propose an application of a new and innovative systemic risk assessment method for the management of emerging risks in the manufacturing environment, namely the functional resonance analysis method (FRAM). Based on the principles of resilience engineering, this method can be used to determine how variability in daily performance could affect the system and lead to desirable or undesirable events.

"Derbali, A.; Hallara, S.",Measuring systemic risk of greek banks: new approach by using the epidemic model SEIR,"In the last decade of the financial crisis of 2007, the international financial system appeared to be on the brink of a major systemic crisis which leads to a failure of a systemically important European bank. This type of scenario highlights the need for identifying and measuring of the contribution of banks to systemic risk in the financial system. Then, the aim of this paper is to propose, for the first time, a new approach to measure systemic risk in the financial institutions. This approach is based on the epidemic model methodology. Then, we use the SEIR model with four compartments: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Removed. We apply this model for a sample of 18 Greek banks listed in the Athens Exchange over the period fromJanuary 2006 to 31 December 2012. Based on the empiricalwe find the existence of 12 times of default transmission during the study period and the transmission of default coincides with the number of Greek banks that have declared failure and then leaving the Athens Exchange. Also, we remark that the continuation of aid and recovery plans granted by international and national regulatory authorities did enough to save Greek banks. 2016 The Author(s).

"Skinner, C.P.",Misconduct risk,"Financial misconduct and systemic risk are two critical issues in financial regulation today. However, for the past several years, financial misconduct and systemic risk have received markedly different treatment. After the global financial crisis, regulators responded to the traditional quantitative risks that banks posethose found on their balance sheets and in their business modelswith sweeping reforms on an internationally coordinated scale. Meanwhile, with respect to misconduct, regulators have reacted with a traditional enforcement approachimposing fines and, in some cases, prosecuting individual malefactors. Yet misconduct is not only an isolated or idiosyncratic risk that can be spot treated with enforcement: misconduct can also be a significant source of risk to the financial system, particularly when it arises on an industry-wide basis. This Article creates a framework for understanding how and under what circumstances misconduct imposes such broad social and economic costs: ""misconduct risk."" This Article explores three features of the banking industry that, in combination, can give rise to misconduct riskdeficient accountability systems, performance-based compensation, and a fluid and transient labor market. Drawing on this conceptual foundation, this Article argues that misconduct risk requires a holistic and preventive approach on par with regulators' efforts to reduce classic balance sheet risks. Specifically, this Article urges bank supervisors to design regulatory tools that proactively target these contagion mechanisms in order to combat misconduct risk. This Article proposes a novel supervisory tool""compliance stress testing""and suggests how this tool can be incorporated into the existing international framework for regulating global banks.",2016,2016-01-01,7,Fordham Law Review,,"Skinner, C.P.

"Molins, J.; Vives, E.",Model risk on credit risk,"This paper develops the Jungle model in a credit portfolio framework. The Jungle model is able to model credit contagion, produce doubly-peaked probability distributions for the total default loss and endogenously generate quasi phase transitions, potentially leading to systemic credit events which happen unexpectedly and without an underlying single cause. We show the Jungle model provides the optimal probability distribution for credit losses, under some reasonable empirical constraints. The Dandelion model, a particular case of the Jungle model, is presented, motivated and exactly solved. The Dandelion model provides an explicit example of doubly-peaked probability distribution for the credit losses. The Diamond model, another instance of the Jungle model, experiences the so called quasi phase transitions in particular, both the U.S. subprime and the European sovereign crises are shown to be potential examples of quasi phase transitions. We suggest how the Jungle model is able to explain a series of empirical stylized facts in credit portfolios, hard to reconcile by some standard credit portfolio models. We look at model risk in a credit risk framework under the Jungle model, especially in relation to systemic risks posed by doubly-peaked distributions and quasi phase transitions. 2015 2016IOS Press and the authors.",2016,2016-01-01,6,Risk and Decision Analysis,banking crises; contagion; credit risk; default clustering; default correlation; model risk,"Molins, J.

A threat, affecting a given IT system, may cause a ripple effect on the other interconnected systems often with unpredictable consequences.

This paper proposes the application of a goal-oriented methodology (GOReM), during the requirements specification phase, in order to consider adequate provisions for prevention and reaction to cyber systemic risk in banking systems. In particular, the context of the Italian banking system is considered as a case study.

"Hemche, O.; Jawadi, F.; Maliki, S.B.; Cheffou, A.I.",On the study of contagion in the context of the subprime crisis: A dynamic conditional correlation-multivariate GARCH approach,"This paper investigates the contagion hypothesis for ten developed and emerging stock markets (France, Italy, UK, Japan, China, Argentina, Mexico, Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt) with respect to the US market in the context of the subprime crisis. In order to capture further time-variation in contagion effects and dynamic linkages between stock markets, our paper makes use of a DCC-MGARH model. Our findings make two interesting contributions to the field. First, we highlighted an increase in dynamic correlations following the subprime crisis for most markets under consideration with regard to the U.S. market. Second, with respect to the contagion test by Forbes and Rigobon (2002) that associates ""pure"" contagion with a significantly higher correlation between markets during the crisis, our showed that the ""pure"" contagion hypothesis is not rejected for France, Italy, the UK or Mexico at the level of 1%, and for Argentina at 10%. Simple interdependence with the US market characterizes the other markets. Our findings thus offer interesting insights in terms of investment and diversification, and offer further insights into systemic risk in these regions. 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2016,2016-01-01,55,Economic Modelling,contagion; dcc-mgarch model; subprime crisis,"Hemche, O.

"Porth, L.; Boyd, M.; Pai, J.",Reducing risk through pooling and selective reinsurance using simulated annealing: an example from crop insurance,"Agricultural insurance is often faced with the challenge of systemic risk, arising from weather risks that tend to be correlated within a specific region in extreme situations, resulting in large crop losses within the region. However, across many regions, especially if regions are considerable distances apart, weather may be quite different and losses may be much less correlated. The of this paper is to improve the diversification of a crop insurance portfolio, through developing a new alternative risk management approach (Model 3) that pools crop risks across all provinces in a country to form a Canada-wide joint insurance pool. This is in contrast to the current approach used in Canada, where crop risks are pooled only within an individual province. Then using a simulated annealing optimization approach, the most suitable combination of the 150 crop types in the portfolio is identified for either retaining in the joint insurance pool or for ceding to reinsurers, such that the variance of the loss coverage ratio of the portfolio is minimized. This model overcomes the problem of insufficient diversification that makes pooling of systemic weather risk challenging. It achieves diversification at a lower cost by using a more efficient combination of pooling and selective reinsurance, resulting in overall higher surplus, higher survival probability, and lower deficit at ruin. 2016 International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.",2016,2016-01-01,7,Geneva Risk and Insurance Review,crop insurance; loss coverage ratio; pooling; portfolio approach; reinsurance; simulated annealing optimization; systemic risk; weather risk,"Porth, L.

In recent years, studies have shown that the origins of CVD may be traced to vascular and metabolic processes in early life. Retinal vascular imaging is a new technology that allows detailed non-invasive in vivo assessment and monitoring of the microvasculature. In this systematic review, we described the application of retinal vascular imaging in children and adolescents, and we examined the use of retinal vascular imaging in understanding CVD risk in early life. We reviewed all publications with quantitative retinal vascular assessment in two databases: PubMed and Scopus. Early life CVD risk factors were classified into four groups: birth risk factors, environmental risk factors, systemic risk factors and conditions linked to future CVD development. Retinal vascular changes were associated with lower birth weight, shorter gestational age, low-fibre and high-sugar diet, lesser physical activity, parental hypertension history, childhood hypertension, childhood overweight obesity, childhood depression anxiety and childhood typediabetes mellitus. In summary, there is increasing evidence supporting the view that structural changes in the retinal microvasculature are associated with CVD risk factors in early life. Thus, the retina is a useful site for pre-clinical assessment of microvascular processes that may underlie the future development of CVD in adulthood. 2016 The Physiological Society.",2016,2016-01-01,37,Journal of Physiology,"adaptive optics imaging; adolescent; analyzer; anxiety disorder; birth weight; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular diseases; cardiovascular risk; child; childhood obesity; complication; depression; diagnostic imaging; dynamic vessel analyzer; environmental factor; eye photography; female; fluorescence imaging; gestational age; growth, development and aging; human; humans; hypertension; imaging; infant, newborn; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; low birth weight; male; medical history; meta analysis; metabolic diseases; newborn; nonhuman; optical coherence tomography; pathogenesis; physical activity; priority journal; retina blood vessel; retinal diseases; retinal vascular imaging; retinal vessels; review; risk factor; sugar intake","Li, L.-J.

"Li, J.; Li, N.; Luo, L.; Ren, Y.",Segmentation of chinese parents based on food risk perception dimensions for risk communication in rural area of sichuan province,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate risk dimensions affecting food risk perceptions and to develop effective risk communication strategies based on their risk perceptions dimensions. The reason for writing this paper is that applying single risk communication strategy for public often fails because food risks are systemic risks and public perceptions toward them consist of multiple dimensions. Launching an effective risk communication need to investigate the perception dimensions of the target audience. Design methodology approach: A total of 2,673 parents of 3-14-year-old children from the rural area of Sichuan province in China were chosen as target audience. Based on the survey conducted about parents’ food risk perceptions, this study used factor-cluster analysis method to segment parents to sub-clusters with significantly different risk perception dimensions. Parents’ representative demographic characteristics within each cluster were further identified through cross-tabs analysis with χ2 tests. Findings: All the parents could be segmented into four sub-clusters, namely, sensitive parents, dependent parents, familiarity-oriented parents and institutional distrust parents, according to their risk perception difference on five dimensions. A series of risk communication strategies were specifically designed for each cluster based on their risk perception features as well as demographic characteristics. Originality value: The insight derived from this study described a deeper image of public risk perceptions and provided suggestions for risk communication launchers to pinpoint the risk perception as well as perception dimensions of the target audience and accordingly develop effective risk communication strategies. 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2016,2016-01-01,2,British Food Journal,adolescent; chi square test; child; china; cluster analysis; food risk perception; human; human experiment; parents; perception; population model; risk communication; risk perception dimensions; rural area; writing,"Li, J.

"Prasch, R.; Warin, T.",Systemic risk and financial regulations: A theoretical perspective,"This article inserts the notion of systemic risk into the theoretical foundations of modern finance. By systemic risk, we mean risks because of interdependence among leading firms, in other words complexity. It builds upon the traditional mean-variance approach while reconsidering an inadequately contemplated source of risk: the actual organization of the financial market. As such, we take seriously the idea that some oligopolistic firms may be understood by market participants to be central to the fabric of modern financial markets, and in that sense can be deemed too big to fail. While we believe that much of traditional financial analysis is valid in its own terms, we also believe that important insights can be acquired from melding Modern Portfolio Theory with recent developments in Industrial Organization. 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",2016,2016-01-01,1,Journal of Banking Regulation,complexity; financial regulations; modern portfolio theory; specific risk; systematic risk; systemic risk,"Prasch, R.

Based on an analytical branching process approximation, we calculate the systemic risk measured by the final fraction of failed nodes on a reference layer. The are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an aggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the two-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling strength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength, systemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in the two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size that are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied to a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into a less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases, this may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated in an aggregated approach. 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2016,2016-01-01,30,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,asymmetric coupling; branching process; cascades; cascades (fluid mechanics); coupling strengths; critical coupling; multiplex networks; mutual amplification; network layers; risk assessment; systemic risk; systemic risks; two-layer network,"Burkholz, R.

We summarize and classify 48 theoretical and empirical research papers from both academia and practitioner organizations. The survey reveals that traditional insurance activity in the life, nonlife, and reinsurance sectors neither contributes to systemic risk nor increases insurers’ vulnerability to impairments of the financial system. However, nontraditional activities (e.g., credit default swap underwriting) might increase vulnerability, and life insurers might be more vulnerable than nonlife insurers due to higher leverage. Whether nontraditional activities also contribute to systemic risk is not entirely clear however, the activities with the potential to contribute to systemic risk include underwriting financial derivatives and providing financial guarantees.

"Billio, M.; Pelizzon, L.; Savona, R.","Systemic risk tomography: signals, measurement and transmission channels","In April 2010 Europe was shocked by the Greek financial turmoil. At that time, the global financial crisis, which started in the summer of 2007 and reached systemic dimensions in September 2008 with the Lehman Brothers crash, took a new course. An adverse feedback loop between sovereign and bank risks reflected into bubble-like spreads, as if financial markets had received a wake-up call concerning the disregarded structural vulnerability of economies at risk.

"Pitilakis, K.; Argyroudis, S.; Kakderi, K.; Selva, J.",Systemic vulnerability and risk assessment of transportation systems under natural hazards towards more resilient and robust infrastructures,"Transportation infrastructures are complex systems of various connected components like bridges, roads, tunnels, embankments, retaining walls in case of a highway system or wharfs, cranes, buildings, utility systems in case of port facilities. Due to their spatial extent, they are exposed to variable natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunami or landslides. Experience from past disastrous events shows that transportation infrastructures are quite vulnerable due to the lack of redundancy, the lengthy repair time, the rerouting difficulties or the cascading failures and interdependencies. Their damage could be greatly disruptive in terms of safety of life, business disruption, access to emergency services and key lifelines utilities, rescue operations and socio-economic impacts. Therefore, in terms of resilience it is important to recognize and quantify the risks and global losses associated to damages of transportation systems and to establish efficient risk mitigation strategies. These include, among others, enhancement of emergency preparedness, strengthening of existing structures and improvement of the recovery planning. Herein an integrated framework for the probabilistic systemic vulnerability and risk assessment of transportation and utility networks is presented, based on the achievements of the recently completed EC project SYNER-G (www.syner-g.eu) and the ongoing EC project STREST (www.strest-eu.org). The infrastructure is modeled according to a detailed taxonomy. The framework encompasses in an integrated fashion all aspects in the chain, from regional hazard to fragility assessment of components to the socio-economic impacts of a natural disaster, accounting for relevant uncertainties within an efficient quantitative simulation scheme, and modeling interactions between multiple component systems in the taxonomy. Selected Performance Indicators (PIs) are calculated for each network based on the estimated damages and functionality losses of the different components under the given hazards. The methodology and tools are demonstrated through case studies in the road network and the harbor of Thessaloniki city, Greece, under seismic hazard and associated geotechnical hazards (i.e. soil liquefaction). The applications include assessments of systems' performance considering the spatial seismic hazard with correlation of ground motion intensities, the vulnerability of the network components, and the effect of interactions within the system, as well as, between components of different systems. In particular, road disruptions can be caused due to direct damage of road segments and bridges, as well as building and overpass collapses. Harbor operations can be disturbed due to failures of waterfront structures and cargo handling equipment, as well as disruptions to the electric power supply and building collapses. The systemic risk for the road network and harbor is calculated, specifically focusing on the short-term impact of seismic events (just after the earthquake) and the risk curves (i.e. mean annual rates of exceedance for loss in performance of the infrastructures) are provided. The significant elements for the functionality of each system are defined through correlation factors to the system PIs. Such can contribute to the decision-making regarding the enhancement of existing and the robust development of new infrastructures in the frame of safety and resiliency. 2016 The Authors.

"Labonte, M.",Systemically important or too big to fail financial institutions,"Although too big to fail (TBTF) has been a longstanding policy issue, it was highlighted by the near-collapse of several large financial firms in 2008. Financial firms are said to be TBTF when policy makers judge that their failure would cause unacceptable disruptions to the overall financial system, and they can be TBTF because of their size or interconnectedness. In addition to fairness issues, economic theory suggests that expectations that a firm will not be allowed to fail create moral hazard-if the creditors and counterparties of a TBTF firm believe that the government will protect them from losses, they have less incentive to monitor the firm's riskiness because they are shielded from the negative consequences of those risks. If so, they could have a funding advantage compared with other banks, which some call an implicit subsidy. There are a number of policy approaches-some complementary, some conflicting-to coping with the TBTF problem, including providing government assistance to prevent TBTF firms from failing or systemic risk from spreading enforcing market discipline to ensure that investors, creditors, and counterparties curb excessive risk-taking at TBTF firms enhancing regulation to hold TBTF firms to stricter prudential standards than other financial firms curbing firms' size and scope, by preventing mergers or compelling firms to divest assets, for example minimizing spillover effects by limiting counterparty exposure and instituting a special resolution regime for failing systemically important firms. A comprehensive policy is likely to incorporate more than one approach, as some approaches are aimed at preventing failures and some at containing fallout when a failure occurs. Parts of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act P.L. 111-203) address all of these policy approaches. For example, it created an enhanced prudential regulatory regime administered by the Federal Reserve for non-bank financial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and banks with more than $50 billion in assets. About 30 U.S. bank holding companies and a larger number of foreign banks have more than $50 billion in assets, and the FSOC has designated three insurers (AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial) and GE Capital as systemically important. A handful of the largest banks face additional capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a special resolution regime administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to take into receivership failing firms that pose a threat to financial stability. This regime has not been used to date, and has some similarities to how the FDIC resolves failing banks. Statutory authority used to prevent financial firms from failing during the crisis has either expired or been narrowed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The fact that most large firms have grown in dollar terms since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act has led some critics to question whether the TBTF problem has been solved. In the 114th Congress, S. 1484 would increase the $50 billion asset threshold to $500 billion for enhanced regulation under Titleof the Dodd-Frank Act. Banks with assets between $50 billion and $500 billion would be subject to a designation process by FSOC. Compared with the current non-bank designation process, S. 1484 would require FSOC to provide more information to (bank or non-bank) institutions and give them more opportunities to take actions to avoid or reverse systemically important financial institution (SIFI) designation. It would also increase public disclosure requirements surrounding the designation process.

"Wu, Y.; Zhou, L.-M.; Lou, H.; Cheng, J.-W.; Wei, R.-L.",The association between obstructive sleep apnea and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Purpose: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a multifactorial disease, and recently epidemiologic studies have investigated the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and NAION. A systematic review of the association of OSA and NAION has not been performed. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was performed to assess such potential association between OSA and risk of NAION. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed for published studies evaluating the association between OSA and NAION. The summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical risk estimates. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed to assess the robustness of pooled outcomes.A total of four prospective cohort studies and one case control study met our inclusion criteria. The pooled OR of developing NAION in the subjects with OSA was 6.18 (95% CI, 2.00 19.11) versus non-OSA controls. Sensitivity analyses showed that no matter one study excluded, the pooled OR did not change significantly, which indicated that the evidence was robust. In subgroup analyses, a significant association was seen in studies matched systemic risk factors (OR, 5.00 95% CI, 2.22 11.25), but not in those non-matched. The magnitude and direction of effects were also affected by methodological variability, including study design, and diagnosis of OSA.The findings from this meta-analysis supported the robust evidence that OSA was a strong independent risk factor of NAION. Relative to non-OSA controls, the subjects with OSA were found to have a more than sixfold risk of NAION. In future, more well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings. 2016 Taylor Francis.",2016,2016-01-01,46,Current Eye Research,"anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; apnea hypopnea index; article; complication; disease association; human; humans; meta analysis; meta-analysis; nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; obstructive sleep apnea; optic neuropathy, ischemic; polysomnography; priority journal; respiratory disturbance index; risk assessment; risk factor; risk factors; sleep apnea, obstructive; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; systematic review","Wu, Y.

"Puaschunder, J.",The call for global responsible inter-generational leadership: the quest of an integration of inter-generational equity in corporate social responsibility (CSR) models,"Global systemic risks of climate change, over-indebtedness in the aftermath of the 2008 09 World Financial Crisis and the need for pension reform in the wake of an aging Western world population currently raise attention for inter-generational fairness. Pressing social dilemmas beyond the control of singular nation states call for corporate social activities to back governmental regulation in crisis mitigation. The following chapter therefore promotes the idea of inter-generational equity in the corporate world to find an inclusive solution comprised by the public and private sectors. In the given literature on global responsible leadership in the corporate sector and contemporary Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) models, inter-generational equity appears to have been neglected. While the notion of sustainability has been integrated in CSR models, inter-generational equity has hardly been touched on as for being a more legal case for codifying the triple bottom line. Advocating for integrating intergenerational equity concerns in CSR models in academia and practice holds untapped advantages of economically influential corporate entities, corporate adaptability and independence from voting cycles. Integrating a temporal dimension in contemporary CSR helps imbuing a longer-term perspective into the corporate world alongside advancing tax ethics and global governance crises prevention. Practical implications for the financing of an inter-generational harmonious solution on climate change burden sharing are proposed. Future research avenues comprise of investigating situational factors influencing inter-generational leadership in the international arena in order to advance the idea of corporations tackling the most pressing contemporary challenges of mankind. 2017 by IGI Global.

"Nucera, F.; Schwaab, B.; Koopman, S.J.; Lucas, A.",The information in systemic risk rankings,We propose to pool alternative systemic risk rankings for financial institutions using the method of principal components. The resulting overall ranking is less affected by estimation uncertainty and model risk. We apply our methodology to disentangle the common signal and the idiosyncratic components from a selection of key systemic risk rankings that have been proposed recently. We use a sample of 113 listed financial sector firms in the European Union over the period 2002 2013. The implied ranking from the principal components is less volatile than most individual risk rankings and leads to less turnover among the top ranked institutions. We also find that price-based rankings and fundamentals-based rankings deviated substantially and for a prolonged time in the period leading up to the financial crisis.

"Idris, I.T.; Nayan, S.",The joint effects of oil price volatility and environmental risks on non-performing loans: evidence from panel data of organization of the petroleum exporting countries,"This paper analyses the joint effects of oil price volatility and environmental risks on non-performing loans (NPLs). Using panel data of 12 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for 2000-2014, we test hypotheses of joint effects of oil price changes and environmental risks on NPLs. Estimates from static panel model highlights the explanatory power of systemic risks theory in linking the effects of oil price volatility and environmental risks on NPLs and underpins their importance for policy implication purposes in OPEC member states. This calls for concerted policy and management response for assessing oil price sensitive and disaster riskiness of borrowing entities. This paper is of particular value to oil dependent countries such as OPEC member states that are net oil exporting countries. From the policy perspectives, there is need for banking regulators to consistently ensure the conduct of both micro-stress and macro-stress tests of loans against the systemic risks of oil price volatility. In addition, policymakers in the banking system should redesign their prudential guidelines to take care of the credit risks vulnerabilities associated with environmental risks and spread their risks across industries and geographical areas that are less prone to disasters. 2016, Econjournals.

"Paulson, A.; Rosen, R.",The life insurance industry and systemic risk: A bond market perspective,"The 2008 financial crisis brought a focus on the potential for a large insurance firm to contribute to systemic risk. Among the concerns raised was that a negative shock to insurers could lead to a fire sale of corporate bonds, a market where insurers are among the largest participants. This manuscript discusses the existing evidence on life insurance firms and systemic risk, with a focus on the investment-grade corporate bond market. We provide some tentative evidence that life insurers tend to absorb liquidity risk by purchasing bonds when the bonds are less liquid than average. However, we do not find evidence that insurers increased bond purchases specifically during the financial crisis, leaving open the question of whether insurers would play a stabilizing role in a future crisis.

"Admati, A.R.",The missed opportunity and challenge of capital regulation,"Capital regulation is critical to address distortions and externalities from intense conflicts of interest in banking and from the failure of markets to counter incentives for recklessness. The approaches to capital regulation in Basel III and related proposals are based on flawed analyses of the relevant tradeoffs. The flaws in the regulations include dangerously low equity levels, a complex and problematic system of risk weights that exacerbates systemic risk and adds distortions, and unnecessary reliance on poor equity substitutes. The underlying problem is a breakdown of governance and lack of accountability to the public throughout the system, including policymakers and economists. 2016, 2016 National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",2016,2016-01-01,21,National Institute Economic Review,agency costs; banking; banking regulation; basel; capital regulations; capital structure; equity in banking; leverage; leverage ratchet effect; risk weights; tlac,"Admati, A.R.

We construct an agent-based network model of an artificial financial system allowing us to analyze the effects of state support on systemic stability and the feedback loops of risk transfer back into the financial system. The model is tested with various parameter settings in Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses yield the following keyfirst, in the short term, all the support measures improve systemic stability. Second, in the longer run, there are settings which mitigate the systemic crisis and settings which contribute to systemic breakdown. Finally, there are differences among the effects of the different types of support measures. While bailouts and recapitalization are the most efficient types of support type and execution of guarantees is still a viable solution, the of liquidity measures such as asset relief or provision of funding liquidity are significantly worse. 2016, Faculty of Social Sciences.

"Naudet, Y.; Mayer, N.; Feltus, C.",Towards a systemic approach for information security risk management,"Risk management in the field of information security is most often handled individually by enterprises, taking only a limited view on the influential factors coming from their providers, clients or more globally from their environment. This approach becomes less appropriate in the case of networked enterprises, which tend to form ecosystems with complex influence links. A more holistic approach is needed to take these into account, leading to systemic risk management, i.e. risk management on the entire system formed by the networked enterprises, to avoid perturbations of the ecosystem due to local, individual, decision-making. In this paper, we propose a new metamodel for Information System Security Risk Management (ISSRM), comprising systemic elements as defined in the General Systems Theory. We discuss the design of this new model, highlighting in particular how risk management can be related to a problem-solving approach and the important concepts that are instantiated when taking a systemic approach to ISSRM. 2016 IEEE.",2016,2016-01-01,6,"Proceedings - 2016 11th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, Ares 2016",decision making; ecology; ecosystems; entire system; general systems theory; holistic approach; influential factors; information management; information security; information security risk managements; information system security risk managements; networked enterprise; problem solving; risk management; security of data; systemic approach,"Naudet, Y.

"Parviz, Y.; Orme, R.; Watson, O.; Chico, T.",Acute coronary syndromes and anaesthesia,"This chapter aims to discuss the classification, pathogenesis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), with particular regard to peri-operative and critically ill patients. It focuses particularly on ACS manifesting as myocardial infarction (both NSTEMI and STEMI), since this is of most clinical importance. Since the majority of ACSs are triggered by rupture of non-flow-limiting plaques, many or most ACSs occur in patients with no preceding symptoms of angina. The systemic risk factors that predispose to atherosclerosis and thus myocardial infarction (MI) are well understood at a population level. Treatment of ACS has been defined in large-scale, randomised trials conducted in patients with spontaneous (Type 1) MI or unstable angina, rather than in peri-operative or critically ill patients. The chapter summarises the treatment guidelines, along with discussion of their relevance to anaesthetists.

"Claessens, S.",An overview of macroprudential policy tools,"Macroprudential policies-caps on loan to value ratios, limits on credit growth and other balance-sheet restrictions, (countercyclical) capital and reserve requirements and surcharges, and Pigouvian levies-have become part of the policy paradigm in emerging markets and developed countries alike. But knowledge of these tools is still limited. Macroprudential policies ought to be motivated by market failures and externalities, but these can be hard to identify. They may also interact with various other policies, such as monetary and microprudential, raising coordination issues. Countries, especially emerging markets, have used these tools, and analyses suggest that some of those tools reduce procyclicality and crisis risks. Yet, much remains to be studied, including the costs of such tools, as they may adversely affect resource allocations how best to adapt these tools to a country's circumstances and preferred institutional designs, including how to address political economy risks. As such, policy makers should move carefully in adopting these tools. 2015 by Annual Reviews.

Comparative assessment of yield and risk indices, according to the assets of Russian stock market companies, was carried out on the basis of statistic methods. Standard deviation indices are shown together with variation constant and P-coefficient. Use of price formation model on fixed assets allowed to calculate the yield, reflecting the systemic risks of non-ferrous metallurgy companies. A range of values by each security is shown, reflecting the guiding lines of investor, which prefers the adequate combination of risk and yield. Analysis of calculated indices allowed to make the following- it is possible to form the safe investment portfolio and its optimization within the securities, owned by one-branch emitters in the conditions of limitation of information access, inexperienced investor can create a preference pattern in the choice of assets, define a degree of belief to published data and set the guiding lines of decision-making on security market.",2015,2015-01-01,0,Tsvetnye Metally,asset yield; investment decisions; security market; standard deviation; system risks; variation constant; β-coefficient,"Sokolova, G.V.

"Haimes, Y.Y.; Horowitz, B.M.; Guo, Z.; Andrijcic, E.; Bogdanor, J.",Assessing systemic risk to cloud-computing technology as complex interconnected systems of systems,"This paper presents a methodology for modeling cloud-computing technology (CCT), its users, and, most important, would-be malicious intruders as complex interdependent and interconnected systems of systems (S-o-S). The paper posits and demonstrates that due to the inherent structure of CCT as S-o-S, users of public CCT are at a higher risk of unlawful intrusion than users of non-CCT systems. At the same time, the flexibility and the agility of CCT S-o-S provide advantages relative to most non-CCT S-o-S. The need is for the CCT community to employ these advantages as an integral part of its cyber security strategy. Our analysis builds on the following theory and methodology: we consider CCT and its users as complex interconnected hardware and software subsystems that interact as S-o-S through shared states, resources, and subsystems, which are connected in series (rather than in parallel, as is the case for most non-CCT systems) exploiting the serial connectivity of CCT S-o-S, we use fault-tree analysis to demonstrate the resulting unreliability of CCT S-o-S building on the published literature, we incorporate Pareto-optimal frontiers to compare the risks faced by security-conscious users of CCT (e.g., large corporations) versus those faced by cost-conscious users (e.g., small or startup companies) and we show that users of CCT as S-o-S are at a higher risk than users of non-CCT systems for certain assumptions and types of cyber attacks. The paper is structured as follows: Part A outlines the characteristics of CCT S-o-S, addresses the inherent vulnerability of CCT S-o-S to cyber intrusion and attack, and provides a brief literature review Partoffers a rationale for modeling CCT as interconnected and interdependent S-o-S Partdemonstrates, through the use of fault-tree analysis, the higher risk faced by CCT and its users as complex S-o-S Partpresents an economic analysis of the security of CCT as S-o-S and Partoffers and lessons learned. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2015,2015-01-01,17,Systems Engineering,"cloud computing; cloud computing technologies; complex interconnected systems; computation theory; computer crime; cyber intrusion; economic analysis; fault tree analysis; hardware and software; literature reviews; network security; pareto principle; pareto-optimal frontiers; risk assessment; risk perception; start-up companies; system of systems; systems of systems; systems of systems, cloud computing, risk to cloud users","Haimes, Y.Y.

Material and Methods: A total of 225 teenagers were asked to complete a questionnaire on the awareness of complications of oral piercing. An additional questionnaire was administered in case of oral piercing worn, based on site piercing, knowledge about piercer license, oral and systemic risks due to oral piercing, disinfection and sterilization of the material pierced, information by the piercer about piercing hygiene maintenance and post-piercing dentist check-up. After questionnaire all partecipants received a brochure with some information about risks and maintenance mode of piercing.Data revealed that more than 50% of teens surveyed was found to wear a piercing. Only 25.3% was aware of the risk of HCV cross-infection and only 17.3% reported of knowledge about risk of endocarditis. Only 17% checked the piercer license and only 18% sterilization and disinfection of the materials used. 53.7% did not received explanations about the risks associated with piercing. With regard to the maintenance mode of the piercing, it has been suggested to brush the piercing bar in 17% of cases. The post piercing specialist visits have been suggested only in 7% of cases.The general lack of awareness of complications and maintenance mode related to oral piercing needs to be addressed by some education programs performed at school and by dentists. 2015, Medicina Oral S.

"Eder, A.; Keiler, S.",CDS spreads and contagion amongst systemically important financial institutionsA spatial econometric approach,"This study applies a novel way of measuring, quantifying and modelling the contagion risk amongst financial institutions. The magnitude of risk spill over effects is gauged by introducing a specific weighting scheme to the regression. This approach originally stems from spatial econometrics. The methodology allows for a decomposition of the credit spread into a contagion risk premium, a systematic risk premium and an idiosyncratic risk premium. We identify considerable risk spill overs due to the interconnectedness of the financial institutes in the sample. In stress tests, up to one-fifth of the CDS spread changes are owing to financial contagion. These also give an alternative explanation for the nonlinear relationship between a debtor's theoretical probability of default and the observed credit spreadsknown as the 'credit spread puzzle'. 2015 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",2015,2015-01-01,18,International Journal of Finance and Economics,cds spread; cds spreads; econometrics; economic analysis; financial contagion; financial system; government policy and regulation; policy making; regulatory framework; spatial analysis; spatial econometrics; systemic risk,"Eder, A.

"Gehrig, T.P.",Changing business models in banking and systemic risk,"The changing economic environment did affect the nature of banking in a profound way. Both easy monetary policy causing low interest rates as well as increasing globalization exerting competitive pressure on lending margin significantly reduced net interest margins in traditional lending. In particular, after the high interest rate period of the late 1980s long-term lending and house-bank relations did suffer severely. As a reaction the banking sector at large increasingly focused on short-term trading and investment banking. This process was accompanied by regulatory incentives and internal governance structures. In particular, the increasing focus on short term compensation based on return on equity, together with the Basle process of capital regulation opened ways of reducing loss absorbing capital and thus undermining banks stability as well as the resiliency of the banking sector at large. Both, the reactions of business models to a changing competitive environment as well as reactions to monetary as well as regulatory policy significantly contributed to systemic risk in Europe and the US.

"Zhou, H.",China’s monetary policy regulation and financial risk prevention: the study of effectiveness and appropriateness,"This book utilizes an innovative approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the correlations between monetary policy, economic growth, inflation and asset price volatility, explores the creation of financial risk prevention systems and reaches with both theoretical and practical value. The book offers an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of monetary policy, specifies the correlations between monetary policy, economic growth and inflation and provides a theoretical basis for and empirical demonstration of monetary policy implementation in China. Previous research in China has primarily focused on the correlation between monetary policy and a specific asset price, while this book comprehensively addresses the appropriateness of real estate, stock, bond and futures price regulation through monetary policies, lending it a high degree of practical significance. In order to arrive at a systemic risk prevention and regulation mechanism for China, the book uses the GARCH mean value model and MGARCH-BEKK model to create a pressure index and provide a three-level pre-warning system for currency crises, bank crises and asset bubble crises. The book systemically introduces the idea of macro-prudential regulation into the Chinese financial system by first clarifying the necessity of implementing macro-prudential regulation in China and then proving its effectiveness in mitigating pro-cyclicality and enhancing steady economic growth by constructing a mitigation model.

Retrospectively, the differences were assessed between the two groups for baseline characteristics, ocular factors, systemic factors, and lifestyle factors. Also, the mean deviation of visual field was compared between the two groups.: Patients from both ICS and IPS groups were of similar age, gender, family history of glaucoma, and follow-up periods. Frequency of disc hemorrhage was significantly higher among patients with ICS than in patients with IPS. Moreover, systemic risk factors such as hypotension, migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, and snoring were more prevalent in the ICS group than in the IPS group. There were no statistical differences in lifestyle risk factors such as smoking or body mass index. Pattern standard deviation was significantly greater in the ICS group than in the IPS group, but the mean deviation was similar between the two groups.: NTG Patients with ICS and IPS have different profiles of risk factors and clinical characteristics. This suggests that the pattern of initial visual field loss may be useful to identify patients at higher risk of central field loss.",2015,2015-01-01,17,Korean Journal of Ophthalmology : Kjo,complication; female; human; humans; incidence; intraocular pressure; low tension glaucoma; male; middle aged; optic disk; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; republic of korea; retrospective studies; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; risk factors; scotoma; south korea; visual field; visual fields,"Kang, J.-W.

"Amini, H.; Minca, A.; Sulem, A.",Control of interbank contagion under partial information,"We consider a stylized core-periphery financial network in which links lead to the creation of projects in the outside economy but make banks prone to contagion risk. The controller seeks to maximize, under budget constraints, the value of the financial system defined as the total number of projects. Under partial information on interbank links, revealed in conjunction with the spread of contagion, the optimal control problem is shown to become a Markov decision problem. We determine the optimal intervention policy by using dynamic programming. Our numerical show that the value of the system depends on the connectivity in a nonmonotonous way: it first increases with connectivity and then decreases with connectivity. The maximum value attained depends critically on the budget of the controller. Moreover, we show that for highly connected systems, it is optimal to increase the rate of intervention in the peripheral banks rather than in core banks. 2015 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",2015,2015-01-01,8,Siam Journal on Financial Mathematics,financial networks; optimal control; systemic risk,"Amini, H.

"Ramady, M.A.",Effective regulatory regimes: a comparative analysis of GCC financial regulators,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the global financial crisis on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) bank regulation and the impact on the region and the policies adopted by the regulators to avoid financial panic and contagion. Design methodology approach The author examines GCC countries’ financial soundness indicators in terms of capital adequacy, non-performing loans and provisioning rates, including central bank liquidity support, deposit guarantees, capital injections and monetary easing and policies to mitigate risk assessment, and the monitoring and elimination of practices promoting excessive risk. GCC compliance regimes through multinational organizations and the exposure of the region to cross-border financial linkages to test for financial soundness are assessed. Findings Overall, indicate that comprehensive regulatory oversight exists in the GCC in conformity with international standards, and Basel capital adequacy requirements, and that the GCC regulators have acted prudently to establish high coverage in all measures but that gaps exit concerning cross-border surveillance and a need for imposition of capital surcharges on banks deemed high systemic risk. The supervision of Islamic financial institutions and a lack of inter-GCC liquidity support mechanism for this segment are highlighted. Practical implications The paper shows that the GCC regulators need to address cross-border surveillance, as local banks branch internationally and foreign banks operate in the region.

"Cimini, G.; Squartini, T.; Gabrielli, A.; Garlaschelli, D.",Estimating topological properties of weighted networks from limited information,"A problem typically encountered when studying complex systems is the limitedness of the information available on their topology, which hinders our understanding of their structure and of the dynamical processes taking place on them. A paramount example is provided by financial networks, whose data are privacy protected: Banks publicly disclose only their aggregate exposure towards other banks, keeping individual exposures towards each single bank secret. Yet, the estimation of systemic risk strongly depends on the detailed structure of the interbank network. The resulting challenge is that of using aggregate information to statistically reconstruct a network and correctly predict its higher-order properties. Standard approaches either generate unrealistically dense networks, or fail to reproduce the observed topology by assigning homogeneous link weights. Here, we develop a reconstruction method, based on statistical mechanics concepts, that makes use of the empirical link density in a highly nontrivial way. Technically, our approach consists in the preliminary estimation of node degrees from empirical node strengths and link density, followed by a maximum-entropy inference based on a combination of empirical strengths and estimated degrees. Our method is successfully tested on the international trade network and the interbank money market, and represents a valuable tool for gaining insights on privacy-protected or partially accessible systems. 2015 American Physical Society. 2015 American Physical Society.",2015,2015-01-01,36,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics",aggregate exposure; aggregates; commerce; complex networks; dynamical process; financial markets; financial networks; individual exposures; international trade; limited information; reconstruction method; risk perception; statistical mechanics; topological properties; topology; weighted networks,"Cimini, G.

These challenges are rooted in the interaction between various stakeholders that affect DRM and the integration of CCA, directly or indirectly. This study explores the degree of integration in on-the-ground measures by studying systemic challenges, using the Nicaraguan DRM system as a case study. A theoretical framework for investigating systemic challenges in DRM systems was developed. It was then used in a retrospective analysis of the different functions of the systems in order to identify fragmentation in knowledge, information and coordination flows at local and national levels of governance. The revealed several fragmented processes and functions in the Nicaraguan DRM system. These lead to difficulties in consolidating relevant information produced by multiple governmental authorities at different levels, and transferring this information to the local level. Fragmentation also leads, in turn, to little integration of CCA aspects into DRM in both local planning and practice. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,2015-01-01,30,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,climate change adaptation; design science; disaster risk management; disaster risk reduction; fragmentation; nicaragua; resilience; systemic risk; urban planning,"Rivera, C.

FM 100 hue-test was performed in 253 subjects with no clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy. All subjects underwent detailed ophthalmic evaluation including cataract grading using LOCS III and 45 4-field stereoscopic fundus photography. Various ocular and systemic risk factors for impairment of colour vision (ICV) were assessed in subjects with diabetes but no retinopathy.value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.The mean age of the study sample was 57.08 9.21 (range: 44-86 years). Gender adjusted prevalence of ICV among subjects with diabetes with no retinopathy was 39.5% (CI: 33.5- 45.5). The mean total error score in the study sample was 197.77 100 (range: 19-583). The risk factors for ICV in the study were women OR: 1.79 (1.00-3.18), increased resting heart rate OR: 1.04 (1.01-1.07) and increased intraocular pressure OR: 1.12 (1.00-1.24). Significant protective factor was serum high-density lipoprotein OR: 0.96 (0.93-0.99).Acquired ICV is an early indicator of neurodegenerative changes in the retina.

"Galle, B.",In praise of ex ante regulation,"Timing is an important consideration in regulatory design. Corrective taxes are usually imposed before or contemporaneously with the harmful activity they are aimed at preventing, while tort awards are assessed ex post, in its aftermath. Patents and research grants both can encourage innovation, but patents pay off only after the invention is marketed. In a world of perfect information, fully rational actors, and complete credit or insurance markets, timing would not matter. In the real world though, the failure of one or more of these assumptions can change dramatically the impact of a regulatory option. For example, prior commentators have largely favored ex post incentives on the ground that government has much better information after the regulated activity is complete. This Article argues that the consensus in favor of ex post regulation overlooks some important considerations. Ex post regulation does provide useful additional information when regulated parties are heterogeneous, but also carries significant and sometimes prohibitive social cost, especially when limited-liability firms produce externalities. Further, drawing on from mathematical simulations,show that the costs of heterogeneity can be sharply reduced with even modest up-front information.apply these insights to a series of examples, including the obesity crisis, the regulation of systemic risk in the banking sector, and state fiscal failures.",2015,2015-01-01,8,Vanderbilt Law Review,,"Galle, B.

Supervisors were charged with using market information to aid them in assessing bank risk. However, little research has been done to incorporate market discipline into how risk is measured over the business cycle. The authors explore how macroeconomic shocks affect discipline in the market for large certificates of deposit. Discipline is estimated using bank-specific measures of risk. The authors' show that as the economy strengthens depositors increase discipline of banks with low capital. As the economy weakens depositors encourage banks to hold more liquidity. As monetary policy contracts depositors punish banks with low capital and high non-performing loans. These findings mainly hold for large banks.

The author formulates and solves the problem of optimal loan size for each industrial sector, as well as the probability minimization problem of a loan default in the case of a crisis in an industrial sector under the capital adequacy ratio norm constraint and a sufficient level of current assets. Next, the author suggests a model for evaluating possible losses due to stress situations in the banking sector and an algorithm for banks ranking based on the Snow vector method, with analysis of several typical examples. All approaches described in the paper appear novel for the Russian banking sector, as the problem of systemic risk evaluation has emerged lately in the context of recent changes in international regulations. 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",2015,2015-01-01,2,Automation and Remote Control,automation; banking sectors; capital adequacies; current assets; industrial sector; international regulations; minimization problems; network stability; systemic risks,"Stezhkin, A.A.

"Friedhoff, J.; Mansouri, M.",Monitoring IT operational risks across US capital markets,"Due to an increasing number of high-profile, technology-related incidents across the US financial markets, industry participants are focused on improving their operational IT risk management frameworks. This is reflected by the inclusion of IT risk guidelines in recent regulatory mandates, industry standards and enterprise risk management methodologies. IT risk is a key component of operational risk, mainly through two event types (or subcategories). One is business disruptions and system failures, which addresses the disruption of regular business due to system failures the other is external fraud, which covers the threats from external parties trying to hack a firm’s systems and computers. Across the US financial markets domain, operational IT events have been shown to have a larger impact on participants than IT security events or IT project failures (Goldstein 2009). Within this context, the monitoring of operational IT risk across the various organizations comprising an extended enterprise such as the US capital markets becomes an important element of systemic risk management for the economy. This paper suggests an approach to assessing IT risk within the operational risk context using an incident-based method for monitoring operational IT risk across an extended enterprise based on the Information Systems Audit and Control Association risk IT framework. The proposed monitoring methodology is illustrated with an example from an extended enterprise within the US capital market. Observations on the approach are also discussed and potential future research is outlined. 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.",2015,2015-01-01,1,Journal of Operational Risk,extended enterprise; it incident monitoring; it risk management,"Friedhoff, J.

"Markose, S.M.; Oluwasegun, B.; Giansante, S.","Multi-agent financial network (MAFN) model of US collateralized debt obligations (CDO): regulatory capital arbitrage, negative CDS carry trade, and systemic risk analysis","A database driven multi-agent model has been developed with automated access to US bank level FDIC Call Reports that yield data on balance sheet and off balance sheet activity, respectively, in Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Credit Default Swaps (CDS). The simultaneous accumulation of RMBS assets on US banks' balance sheets and also large counterparty exposures from CDS positions characterized the $2 trillion Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) market. The latter imploded at the end of 2007 with large scale systemic risk consequences. Based on US FDIC bank data, that could have been available to the regulator at the time, the authors investigate how a CDS negative carry trade combined with incentives provided by Basel II and its precursor in the US, the Joint Agencies Rule 66 Federal Regulation No. 56914, which became effective on January 1, 2002, on synthetic securitization and Credit Risk Transfer (CRT), led to the unsustainable trends and systemic risk. The resultant market structure with heavy concentration in CDS activity involvingUS banks can be shown to present too interconnected to fail systemic risk outcomes. The simulation package can generate the financial network of obligations of the US banks in the CDS market. The authors aim to show how such a Multi-Agent Financial Network (MAFN) model is well suited to monitor bank activity and to stress test policy for perverse incentives on an ongoing basis. 2014, IGI Global.",2015,2015-01-01,2,"Banking, Finance, and Accounting: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",,"Markose, S.M.

"Staum, J.",Nonnegative risk components,"We propose two new methods for attributing the risk of a portfolio or system to its components, in particular when it is required to produce nonnegative risk components that sum to the risk of the portfolio or system as a whole. The first method attributes risk entirely to losses, taking profits for granted. The second method allows profits in some scenarios to offset losses in other scenarios to a certain extent, but not in a way that could yield a negative risk component. We illustrate these methods by applying them to an example in which we attribute a firm’s expected shortfall to business units within the firm and an example in which we attribute systemic risk to banks. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, the methods proposed have some game-theoretic properties that are desirable for risk attribution. 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.",2015,2015-01-01,1,Journal of Risk,cost allocation; cost attribution; risk allocation; risk attribution; risk components; systemic risk,"Staum, J.

"di, B.E.; Fernández-Ponce, J.M.; Palacios-Rodríguez, F.; Rodríguez-Griñolo, M.R.",On multivariate extensions of the conditional value-at-risk measure,"CoVaR is a systemic risk measure proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) able to measure a financial institution's contribution to systemic risk and its contribution to the risk of other financial institutions. CoVaR stands for conditional Value-at-Risk, i.e.it indicates the Value at Risk for a financial institution that is conditional on a certain scenario. In this paper, two alternative extensions of the classic univariate Conditional Value-at-Risk are introduced in a multivariate setting. The two proposed multivariate CoVaRs are constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions (. resp. of multivariate survival distribution functions). These vector-valued measures have the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. Several characterizations of these new risk measures are provided in terms of the copula structure and stochastic orderings of the marginal distributions. Interestingly, these are consistent with existing properties on univariate risk measures. Furthermore, comparisons between existent risk measures and the proposed multivariate CoVaR are developed.

"Galli, A.; Halle, M.; Grunewald, N.",Physical limits to resource access and utilisation and their economic implications in mediterranean economies,"This paper applies Ecological Footprint accounting to Mediterranean countries to track ecological asset balances and investigate the long-term feasibility of fulfilling natural resource and service needs. Our findings are that the Mediterranean region currently uses approximately 2.5 times more natural resources and ecological services than their ecosystems can provide. We argue that when consumption exceeds local availability, countries either resort to depletion of ecological assets or turn to international trade in order to satisfy their demands. Access to outside resources is however limited by (a) the availability of resources on international markets and (b) their affordability. Countries highly dependent on natural resource imports therefore expose their economies to the macroeconomic consequences of price volatility. We find that trade-related effects of natural resource price volatility are significant for Mediterranean economies as a 10% increase in the price of natural resources corresponds with a change in the trade balance between 7% and -2.4% of the GDP. We conclude that, in a world characterised by the existence of physical limits to the availability of global ecological assets, a systemic risk may exist for Mediterranean economies due to the concurrence of (1) ecological asset scarcity, (2) increasing prices and (3) challenging financial situations. 2015 The Authors.",2015,2015-01-01,40,Environmental Science and Policy,accounting; article; carbon footprint; ecological deficit; ecological footprint accounting; economic aspect; economic competitiveness; ecosystem; human; mediterranean sea; physical parameters; population productivity; priority journal; production vs. consumption; resource access and availability; resource related risks; southern europe; trade,"Galli, A.

"Giacometti, R.; Lozza, S.O.; Tomas, T.T.",Portfolio selection with uncertainty measures consistent with additive shifts,"Assuming a non-satiable risk-averse investor, the standard approach to portfolio selection suggests discarding of all inefficient investment in terms of mean return and its standard deviation ratio within its first step. However, in literature we can find many alternative dispersion and risk measures that can help us to identify the most suitable investment opportunity. In this work two new dispersion measures, fulfilling the condition that more is better than less are proposed. Moreover, their distinct characteristics are analysed and empirically compared. In particular, starting from the definition of dispersion measures, we discuss the property of consistency with respect to additive shifts and we examine two dispersion measures that satisfy this property. Finally, we empirically compare the proposed dispersion measures with the standard deviation and the conditional value at risk on the US stock market. Moreover, within the empirical example the so called alarm is incorporated in order to predict potential fails of the market. 2015, University of EconomicsPrague.

"Hartmann, P.",Real estate markets and macroprudential policy in europe,"Boom-bust cycles in real estate markets have been major factors in systemic financial crises and therefore need to be at the forefront of macroprudential policy. The geographically differentiated nature of real estate market fluctuations implies that these policies need to be granular across regions and countries. Before the financial crisis that started in 2007 property markets were overvalued in a range of European countries, but much like in other constituencies active policies addressing this were an exception. An increasing number of studies suggest that borrower-based regulatory policies, such as reductions in loan-to-value or debt-to-income limits, can be effective in leaning against real estate booms. But many of the new macroprudential policy authorities in Europe do not have clear powers to determine them. Moreover, the cross-border spillovers they may give rise to suggest the establishment of a well-defined macroprudential coordination mechanism for the single European market. 2015 European Central Bank.",2015,2015-01-01,32,"Journal of Money, Credit and Banking",bubbles; financial crises; financial regulation; financial stability indicators; macroprudential policy; real estate markets; systemic risk,"Hartmann, P.

"Zlatić, V.; Gabbi, G.; Abraham, H.",Reduction of systemic risk by means of pigouvian taxation,"We analyze the possibility of reduction of systemic risk in financial markets through Pigouvian taxation of financial institutions, which is used to support the rescue fund. We introduce the concept of the cascade risk with a clear operational definition as a subclass and a network related measure of the systemic risk. Using financial networks constructed from real Italian money market data and using realistic parameters, we show that the cascade risk can be substantially reduced by a small rate of taxation and by means of a simple strategy of the money transfer from the rescue fund to interbanking market subjects. Furthermore, we show that while negative effects on the return on investment (ROI) are direct and certain, an overall positive effect on risk adjusted return on investments (ROIRA) is visible. Please note that the taxation is introduced as a monetary regulatory, not as a -scal measure, as the term could suggest. The rescue fund is implemented in a form of a common reserve fund.

"Bristor, A.J.; Barnes, S.L.; Fu, M.C.",Regulation of systemic risk through contributory endogenous agent-based modeling,"The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) was created to identify and respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The research arm of the FSOC, the Office of Financial Research, has begun to explore agent-based models (ABMs) for measuring the emergent threat of systemic risk. We propose an ABM-based regulatory structure that incentivizes the honest participation and data contribution of regulated firms while providing clarity into the actions of the firms as endogenous to the market and driving emergent behavior. We build this scheme onto an existing ABM of a single-asset market to examine whether the structure of this scheme could provide its own benefits to market stabilization. We find that without regulatory intervention, markets acting within this proposed structure experience fewer bankruptcies and lower leverage buildup while returning larger profits for the same amount of risk. 2014 IEEE.",2015,2015-01-01,0,Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference,agent-based model; asset markets; autonomous agents; commerce; computational methods; emergent behaviors; finance; financial stability; financial system; regulatory interventions; regulatory structure; simulation platform; systemic risks,"Bristor, A.J.

The current instability on world financial markets being the consequence of global crisis stipulates the necessity for more searching examination and assessment of probable risks. The most important factor stipulating the stability of the commercial bank is being the application of adequate assessment of financial losses under the conditions of market’s instability. This will provide creation of prerequisites for effective control and management of risks in the period of increase of recessionary situation in the Russian economy. The goal of this paper is the conceptual research of stress-testing evolution as the method for assessment of systemic risks in the epoch of financial globalization, and also the substantiation of recommendations on improvement of the system of practical realization of stress testing method in the framework of counter-cyclic regulation with account of tendencies for development of international banking supervision. The methodological of research is based on the principles of comparative and system analysis, unity of qualitative and quantitative, historical and logical approach. In the paper the historical is considered, novations in the area of legislative regulation of banking risks in Russia and abroad are analyzed. In the framework of research the main problems and disadvantages of existing practice of stress testing are defined, the approach of the Bank of Russia to conduction of stress-tests is characterized, the affairs, the implementation of which will help stress testing to take its proper place among the instruments for regulation and supervision of banking system of Russia. 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

"López-Espinosa, G.; Moreno, A.; Rubia, A.; Valderrama, L.",Systemic risk and asymmetric responses in the financial industry,"To date, an operational measure of systemic risk capturing nonlinear tail-comovements between system-wide and individual bank returns has not yet been developed. This paper proposes an extension of the CoVaR methodology in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) to capture the asymmetric response of the banking system to positive and negative shocks to the market-valued balance sheets of individual banks. Building on a comprehensive sample of U.S. banks in the period 1990-2010, the evidence in this paper shows that ignoring asymmetries that feature tail-interdependences may lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk. On average, the relative impact on the system of a fall in individual market value is sevenfold that of an increase. Moreover, the downward bias in systemic-risk measuring from ignoring this asymmetric pattern increases with bank size. In particular, the conditional tail-comovement between the banking system and a bank that is losing market value belonging to the top size-sorted decile is nearly 5.5 times larger than the unconditional tail-comovement versus 3.3 times for banks in the bottom decile. The asymmetric model also produces much better fitting, with the restriction that gives rise to the standard symmetric model being rejected for most firms in the sample, particularly, in the segment of large-scale banks. This result is important from a regulatory and supervisory perspective, since the asymmetric generalization enhances the capacity to monitor systemic interdependences. 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2015,2015-01-01,34,Journal of Banking and Finance,downside risk; systemic risk; tail-risk dependence; value at risk,"López-Espinosa, G.

"Zakaria, F.",Systemic risk and financial contagion in morocco: new approaches of quantification,"In this paper, we search to evaluate the systemic risk of the Moroccan banking sector. Indeed, we concentrate on the analysis and the evaluation on transverse dimension of the systemic. From this point of view, two approaches were used. First is based on the estimate on value at risk conditional allowing to measure the systemic importance of each banking institution. In addition, the second approach uses the heteroscedasticity models in order to consider the conditional correlations, making it possible, to measure the dependence between the Moroccan banks and with the whole of the financial system. The obtained with through these two approaches confirm that ATW, BMCI and the BMCE are the most systemic banks in Moroccan banking system and who can initiate a systemic crisis. On another register and by using the conditional correlations of each bank we built an index of systemic risk. Moreover, a macrofinancial model was developed, connecting the index of the systemic risk and the principal macroeconomic variables. This model affirmed that the contagion dimension of systemic risk is procyclical.

"Hu, D.; Schwabe, G.; Li, X.",Systemic risk management and investment analysis with financial network analytics: research opportunities and challenges,"Recent economic crises like the 2008 financial tsunami has demonstrated a critical need for better understanding of the topologies and various economic, social, and technical mechanisms of the increasingly interconnected global financial system. Such a system largely relies on the interconnectedness of various financial entities such as banks, firms, and investors through complex financial relationships such as interbank payment networks, investment relations, or supply chains. A network-based perspective or approach is needed to study various financial networks in order to improve or extend financial theories, as well as develop business applications. Moreover, with the advance of big data related technologies, and the availability of huge amounts of financial and economic network data, advanced computing technologies and data analytics that can comprehend such big data are also needed. We referred this approach as financial network analytics. We suggest that it will enable stakeholders better understand the network dynamics within the interconnected global financial system and help designing financial policies such as managing and monitoring banking systemic risk, as well as developing intelligent business applications like banking advisory systems. In this paper, we review the existing research about financial network analytics and then discuss its main research challenges from the economic, social, and technological perspectives. 2015, Hu et al. licensee Springer.",2015,2015-01-01,7,Financial Innovation,financial network analytics; investment analysis; risk management,"Hu, D.

"Lopez-Castañon, C.; Martinez-Jaramillo, S.; Lopez-Gallo, F.","Systemic risk, stress testing, and financial contagion: their interaction and measurement","Despite the acknowledgment of the relevance of Systemic Risk, there is a lack of consensus on its definition and, more importantly, on the way it should be measured. Fortunately, there is a growing research agenda and more financial regulators, central bankers, and academics have recently been focusing on this field. In this chapter, the authors obtain a distribution of losses for the banking system as a whole. They are convinced that such distribution of losses is the key element that could be used to develop relevant measures for systemic risk. Their model contemplates several aspects, which they consider important regarding the concept of systemic risk: an initial macroeconomic shock, which weakens some institutions (some of them to the point of failure), a contagion process by means of the interbank market, and the resulting losses to the financial system as a whole. Finally, once the distribution is estimated, the authors derive standard risk measures for the system as a whole, focusing on the tail of the distribution (where the catastrophic or systemic events are located). By using the proposed framework, it is also possible to perform stress testing in a coherent way, including second round effects like contagion through the interbank market. Additionally, it is possible to follow the evolution of certain coherent risk measures, like the CVaR, in order to evaluate if the system is becoming more or less risky, in fact, more or less fragile. Additionally, the authors decompose the distribution of losses of the whole banking system into the systemic and the contagion elements and determine if the system is more prone to experience contagious difficulties during a certain period of time. 2015, IGI Global.",2015,2015-01-01,0,"Banking, Finance, and Accounting: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications",,"Lopez-Castañon, C.

"Tseng, K.-C.",The aftermath of financial crisis and great recession and what to do about them,"The 2007-2009 financial crisis and great recession was the most serious and lasted longer than any other 11 previous ones during the entire post war period. This recession resulted in an estimated 8-12 million job loss and GDP suffered more than $15 trillion or equivalent to one year's GDP. The Federal debt increased from about 63% of GDP at the end of 2007 to 101% by the end of 2012. Both the Federal Reserve and the Federal Government have undertaken some unprecedented and extraordinary measures by going around traditional policy rules and overcoming difficult legislative process to rescue financial institutions and a few industrial companies. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA) of 2010 passed four years ago. Yet the laws and rules have only been slowly and gradually phased in. In fact, since the financial crisis, large financial institutions have been getting larger. Capital ratio must be increased and all OTC derivatives must go through exchanges or clearing houses. All regulators must seriously enforce all rules and regulations and overcome the pressure from political lobbyists or special active interest groups. Financial and economic stability for the country as a whole must be the very top priority. Regulators must try their best to make sure that large financial institutions will not take too much risk to jeopardize financial and economic stability. To minimize excessive risk-taking and systemic risk spill over, capital ratio at the large interconnected institutions should be significantly increased to reflect the size and risk exposure of these institutions. Periodic stress tests must be conducted as often as necessary. The DFA rules and regulations and further improvements must be phased in as soon as possible. However, the effectiveness of US new regulations may be negatively affected by the slow action of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the global economic slowdown. Thus the US government officials must also coordinate with ECB, IMF and other major central banks to find the best possible ways to enforce the new rules and regulations to ensure global financial stability.

"Agarwal, V.; Mullally, K.A.; Naik, N.Y.",The economics and finance of hedge funds: A review of the academic literature,"Hedge funds have become increasingly important players in financial markets. This heightened importance has spawned a large academic literature focused on issues pertinent to hedge fund managers, investors, regulators, and policymakers. Although the top four finance journals (the Journal of Finance, the Journal of Financial Economics, the Review of Financial Studies, and the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis) published only 16 papers on hedge funds prior to 2005, they have published 105 papers on hedge funds since 2005. As a result, we felt that it is time to update the monograph published in 2005 Agarwal and Naik, 2005This update, prepared with the help of new coauthor Kevin Mullally, extends the previous monograph along two dimensions. First, it includes reviews of recent studies on topics that were covered in the earlier monograph. Second, it summarizes research on new topics that were not part of the previous monograph. These new topics cover a broad gamut of issues ranging from hedge funds' use of leverage and exposure to different risks to their impact on various asset markets. This monograph consists of five broad sections. The first section reviews the literature examining both the time-series and crosssectional variation in hedge fund performance. Time-series performance studies cover return-generating processes, dynamic risk exposures, and determination of managerial skill. The second section covers studies focused on the cross-sectional relations between hedge funds' characteristics (including contractual features and time-varying features such as size and age) and fund performance. The third section analyzes the literature on the sources and nature of risks faced by hedge fund investors. In particular, we discuss risks that can arise from managerial incentives and sources of capital. The fourth section summarizes research on the role of hedge funds in the financial system. Specific topics here include hedge funds' impact on systemic risk, asset prices, and liquidity provision in financial markets. The fifth and final section focuses on potential biases and limitations of hedge fund data sources. 2015 V. Agarwal, K. A. Mullally and N. Y.

"Bollen, B.; Skully, M.; Tripe, D.; Wei, X.",The global financial crisis and its impact on australian bank risk,"This paper examines the global financial crisis (GFC) and its impact on Australian banking risk. An augmented market model is developed to identify changes in listed Australian bank systematic risk in relation to three key events: the GFC's start in August 2007, the market downturn in Australian and global share markets in January 2008, and the announcement of Australia's Deposit and Wholesale Funding Guarantee (DWFG) scheme on 12 October 2008. The study also examines changes in bank systemic risk during these event periods. The Australian market offers a unique opportunity to observe the impact of the of the DWFG in that it lacked any explicit deposit insurance prior to the crisis. Initially, the crisis period had little impact on bank systematic risk while bank systemic risk increased considerably. The share market downturn caused a marked increase in both systematic and systemic risks for Australia's major internationally connected banks followed by a reduction in both systematic and systemic risks with the of the guarantee scheme for all Australian banks. 2014 International Review of Finance Ltd.",2015,2015-01-01,13,International Review of Finance,,"Bollen, B.

"Schwarcz, S.L.",The governance structure of shadow banking: rethinking assumptions about limited liability,"In an earlier article,argued that shadow banking-the provision of financial services and products outside of the traditional banking system, and thus without the need for bank intermediation between capital markets and the users of funds-is so radically transforming finance that regulatory scholars need to rethink their basic assumptions. This Article attempts to rethink the corporate governance assumption that owners of firms should always have their liability limited to the capital they have invested. In the relatively small and decentralized firms that dominate shadow banking, equity investors tend to be active managers. Limited liability gives these investor-managers strong incentives to take risks that could generate outsized personal profits, even if that greatly increases systemic risk. For shadow banking firms subject to this conflict, limited liability should be redesigned to better align investor and societal interests. 2014 Steven L.

"Tajti, T.",The law-finance-technology nexus in the 21st century is there a need to rethink the limits of law,"As readily proven by the Credit Crunch and the consequent 2008 Global Financial Crisis, our perception of what law and regulation can achieve to forestall fi nancial calamities and to protect the integrity of the system was seriously mistaken. Besides the misjudged risks generated by fi nancial innovation as well as fi nancial pathology and general incomprehension of fi nance as such, two further misconceptions are of interdisciplinary nature. On the one hand, the risk-Type that was brought to the surface by the Credit Crunch was systemic risk a risk of complexity and dimensions that was corollary only to the Great Depression erupting in 1929. From a legal perspective, this meant unprecedented interpenetration of various branches of law, from mortgage and corporate to securities law. The central piece in the puzzleasset securitizationwas a synergic product of these. The fi rst conclusion the paper draws is that in the light of this there is a need for a new legal disciplinethe law of fi nancethat would spread over all these branches of law (internal inter-disciplinarity). On the other hand, both the Credit Crunch as well as the subsequent developments on fi nancial markets show that understanding fi nance and the risks inherent to it are not only becoming increasingly problematic (not only for lawyers) but that some of the risks are unidentifi able (""unknown unknowns""). Finance is inherently complex, yet further exacerbating factors are the growing presence of technology, mathematization of fi nance (and economics) and the possible synergic effects of various, often seemingly not linked, fi nancial products. The second claim this paper makes consequently is that legal scholarship should face, comprehend and reckon with the roles other disciplines increasingly play in fi nance (external inter-disciplinarity) and the fundamentally altered nature of fi nance. Subscribing to the conclusionon an abstract and theoretical levelthat the looming crises should be perceived as multi-disciplinary phenomena that as such require multi-disciplinary panacea and more cooperation from the affected disciplines would be easy. In reality, however, little seems to have changed. Suffi ce to take a look at law school curricula to realize that actually few have recipes for such seemingly simple but practical questions as how to teach the law of fi nance, especially where consensus has not been reached even on whether teach it at all.

"Thompson, F.; Rizova, P.","Understanding and creating public value: business is the engine, government the flywheel (and also the regulator)","In this essay, we define the meaning and content of public value, show how government and business create public value, and briefly explain why their governance arrangements work the way they do. We deal first with business and then government. We conclude that government manages risks and that governmental value creation is distinctively concerned with stability. Hence, to make government work better, risk management ought to be central to the practice of public finance, public policy, and public administration. Understanding the importance of stability is potentially of even greater importance to those who research and teach public policy and administration. Indeed, we propose that the elaboration of a general risk assessment model explaining, among other things, government’s systemic inclination to stability, would take our field a long towards integration with mainstream positive social science and, therefore, holds out the prospect of considerable interdisciplinary consilience, although at this time we can do no more than suggest the contours of such a model. 2013, 2013 Taylor Francis.",2015,2015-01-01,22,Public Management Review,government spending and taxing; mechanism; performance; process; public management; risk; sustainability; systemic risk,"Thompson, F.

"Cimpoeru, S.",Using self-organizing maps for assessing systemic risk evidences from the global economic crisis,"The importance of correctly assessing systemic risk has increased substantially after the events from 2007. A wide set of parametric and non-parametric methods has been used to address the problem and identify the leading risk factors for potential crisis situations. Out of these, the class of neural networks represented by self-organizing maps has become an important technique but only with a modest usage for the economic crisis. We apply the self-organizing maps technique for a set of worlds’ economies, with the goal of identifying the resemblances and differences between worlds’ economies. The model developed on self-organizing maps ensures detection of the imbalances and vulnerabilities of economies and find the determinant variables (early warning signals) for a financial-economic crisis situation. The study has the advantage of including in the analysis a pre-crisis and a post-crisis assessment, gaining much insight from the structural changes produced in the topology of the economies. 2015,Academy of Economic Studies, All right reserved.",2015,2015-01-01,1,Economic Computation and Economic Cybernetics Studies and Research,early warning systems; global economic crisis; neural networks; self-organizing maps; systemic risk,"Cimpoeru, S.

"Preis, A.",A framework for cybernetic resilience management,"The postmodern socioeconomic system is coined by an extreme interdependency of organizations around the whole globe. Organizations have to face systemic risks they cannot influence. They have to become more resilient to survive or recover from crises and have to become more efficient to stay successful under the pressure of worldwide competition, at the same time. The goal of this research project was to develop a resilience management framework that allows to control internal risks and to prepare for external risks so that more effective strategies can be applied. The framework provides the benefit of implementing, running and controlling resilience in any type of organization by means of one integrated steering model. The research approach bases on the design science methodology including the analysis of real world requirements, the development of a management framework and the evaluation of the framework. It assures that the new framework provides added value for the governance of organizations in complex environments, including well-orchestrated prevention, intervention and recovery activities over the entire organizational lifecycle. Ascybernetic process models were developed which allow to monitor, to assess and to shift the risks on and the resilience of involved resources. A new management model was designed which integrates the two organizational resilience paradigms of 'planning and control' and 'culture-based management'. The combination of these models into one organizational resilience management framework constitutes the final solution that is applicable for all types of large organizations.",2014,2014-01-01,0,"Proceedings of the 5th International Disaster and Risk Conference: Integrative Risk Management - the Role of Science, Technology and Practice, Idrc Davos 2014",business continuity management; complex environments; crisis management; design; design science methodologies; integrated control; integrated control system; large organizations; management frameworks; planning and control; research and development management; resilience management framework; risk assessment; risk management; societies and institutions; socio-economic systems,"Preis, A.

"Butler, T.; Abi-Lahoud, E.",A mechanism-based explanation of the institutionalization of semantic technologies in the financial industry,"This paper explains how the financial industry is solving its data, risk management, and associated vocabulary problems using semantic technologies. The paper is the first to examine this phenomenon and to identify the social and institutional mechanisms being applied to socially construct a standard common vocabulary using ontology-based models. This standardized ontology-based common vocabulary will underpin the design of next generation of semantically- enabled information systems (IS) for the financial industry. The mechanisms that are helping institutionalize this common vocabulary are identified using a longitudinal case study, whose embedded units of analysis focus on central agents of change the Enterprise Data Management Council and the Object Management Group. All this has important implications for society, as it is intended that semantically-enabled IS will, for example, provide stakeholders, such as regulators, with better transparency over systemic risks to national and international financial systems, thereby mitigating or avoiding future financial crises.

"Hamada, H.; Matsuo, A.; Koizumi, T.; Satomi, T.; Chikazu, D.",A simple evaluation method for early detection of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the mandible using computed tomography,"The aim of this study was to establish a simple method for the early detection of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) using computed tomography (CT). Materials and methods CT images of the mandible were obtained from a total of 20 patients with BRONJ and 20 control subjects. BRONJ was classified intogroups, with bone exposure (Stage 1-3 BRONJ) or without (StageBRONJ). In each patient, 15 transaxial CT images were selected and 30 configured regions of interest (ROI) were identified. The ANOVA test was applied to test the relationship between the severity of systemic risk factors. Regarding the local status of the mandible, significant differences were observed among the StageBRONJ, Stage 1-3 BRONJ, non-BRONJ and control groups in the cancellous bone CT radiodensity values, but there were no significant differences between the Stageand Stage 1-3 BRONJ groups. In the cortical bone widths, significant differences were observed only between BRONJ and the controls. Measuring cancellous bone CT radiodensity value has the potential to be a simple and quantitative method to detect the early stages of BRONJ. 2014 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

"Calmès, C.; Théoret, R.",Bank systemic risk and macroeconomic shocks: canadian ands evidence,"This paper investigates how banks, as a group, react to macroeconomic risk and uncertainty more specifically, it examines the relationship between bank systemic risk and changes and disruptions in economic conditions. Adopting the methodology of Beaudry et al. (2001), we introduce a new estimation procedure based on EGARCH to refine the framework developed by Baum et al. (2002, 2004, 2009) and Quagliariello (2007, 2009), and we analyze the relationship in the current industry context-i.e., in the context of market-based banking. Our confirm that banks tend to behave more homogeneously vis- -vis macroeconomic uncertainty. In particular, we find that both the cross-sectional dispersion of loans-to-assets and the cross-sectional dispersion of non-interest income share shrink during slow growth episodes, and particularly during financial crises, when the resilience of the banking system is at its lowest. More importantly, our main findings indicate that the cross-sectional dispersion of loans-to-assets has increased in the last decade, whereas the cross-sectional dispersion of non-interest income share appears to be more volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic shocks. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,2014-01-01,44,Journal of Banking and Finance,egarch; financial stability; macroeconomic shocks; macroprudential policy; non-interest income,"Calmès, C.

"Marsili, M.",Complexity and financial stability in a large random economy,"study the limit of a large random economy, in the ideal case of perfect competition, where full information is available to all market participants, and where a set of consumers invests in financial instruments engineered by banks in order to optimize their future consumption. This provides a picture of how unregulated financial innovation pushes an economy towards the ideal limit of complete markets. Hedging new products with existing products allows financial institutions to reduce the associated risk and hence the risk premium. This has the expected consequence that markets, under such ideal conditions, converge to market completeness as the repertoire of financial instruments expands. As markets approach completeness, however, two 'unintended consequences' also arise: (i) equilibrium portfolios develop a marked susceptibility to idiosyncratic shocks and or parameter uncertainty and (ii) hedging engenders divergent trading volumes in the interbank market. Combining these suggests an inverse relation between financial stability and the size of the financial sector, which can be quantified within the present framework. These suggest that even under perfect competition and symmetric information, the pursuit of market efficiency-in terms of completeness-may erode financial stability. The proliferation of financial instruments exacerbates the effects of market imperfections and, in order to prevent an escalation of perverse effects, markets may require institutional structures that become more and more substantial as their complexity expands. 2014 Copyright Taylor Francis Group, LLC.",2014,2014-01-01,3,Quantitative Finance,complexity in finance; equilibrium asset-pricing models; financial stability; statistical mechanics; systemic risk,"Marsili, M.

"Castro, M.R.C.; Stancato, d.S.S.R.; Silva, T.C.; Tabak, B.M.",Connectivity and systemic risk in the brazilian national payments system,"In this paper, we analyse a unique dataset, which comprises funds transfers processed by the Brazilian Payments System (BPS), using network theory concepts. The conducted analyses reveal that there is a subset of financial institutions that act as money centres. The local importance of financial institutions is moderately concentrated and assumes increased values between 2006 and 2011. Moreover, we investigate the impact that default of institutions cause on their neighbourhood and also find the most probable contagion paths within the banking system. The contagion paths change over time, but the network's central institutions remain the same. In order to assess the systemic impact of the banks' defaults, we simulate default cascades and complement the with liquidity and solvency stress measures. We find that failure cascades hardly happen. When they do occur, the average propagation chain's length is very short. We also do not find any significant stress measure associated with banks' defaults. As a consequence, we do not find evidence of significant systemic risk associated with the BPS. Finally, we extract topological information of the network's structure by using several network measures, such as ones related to centrality and degree correlation. The extracted information is relevant for monitoring the financial stability and for understanding, in an intuitive way, many structural characteristics of the investigated network.

"Ong, L.L.; Pazarbasioglu, C.",Credibility and crisis stress testing,"Credibility is the bedrock of any crisis stress test. The use of stress tests to manage systemic risk was introduced by the U.S. authorities in 2009 in the form of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. Since then, supervisory authorities in other jurisdictions have also conducted similar exercises. In some of those cases, the design and implementation of certain elements of the framework have been criticized for their lack of credibility. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for constructing an effective crisis stress test. It combines financial markets impact studies of previous exercises with relevant case study information gleaned from those experiences to identify the key elements and to formulate their appropriate design. Pertinent concepts, issues and nuances particular to crisis stress testing are also discussed. The findings may be useful for country authorities seeking to include stress tests in their crisis management arsenal, as well as for the design of crisis programs. 2014, MDPI AG.

"O’Brien, J.; Gilligan, G.; Miller, S.",Culture and the future of financial regulation: how to embed restraint in the interests of systemic stability,"This paper examines the challenges associated with setting or recalibrating the philosophy, principles andunderpinning the development of a well-functioning financial systema core term of reference for the Australian Financial System Inquiry. The current philosophy is informed by an emphasis on structure, leaving it to market participants to self-police through a combination of rules and principles. It is informed by a high degree of trust in market ordering and acceptance of conflicts of interest as long as they are managed, thereby delivering beneficial outcomes. Specialisation and expertise are deemed to ensure that risk-taking takes place in fair, orderly and transparent markets. The global financial crisis has severely tested that assumption. As in other markets, trust in the integrity of financial markets and their participants has evaporated. The key policy question is whether the operation of the financial system is, in the vernacular, fairdinkumaccording to or deviating from Australian belief in fairness. The paper explores the defects in the regulatory paradigm through each of the key themes: (i) balancing competition, innovation, efficiency, stability and consumer protection (ii) how financial risk is allocated and systemic risk is managed (iii) assessing the effectiveness and need for financial regulation, including its impact on costs, flexibility, innovation, industry and among users and (iv) the role of government and the role, s, funding and performance of financial regulators including an international comparison. The evaluation demonstrates profound limitations with the current paradigm. We argue that culture is a critical driver of behaviour. It can justify, embed or restrain action but ought to do so in light of institutional purpose. Unless the underpinning philosophy defines duties and responsibilities as well as rights, and links this to a framework that place culture at its core, we risk failing to learn from history.

"Mayordomo, S.; Rodriguez-Moreno, M.; Peña, J.I.",Derivatives holdings and systemic risk in thes banking sector,"This paper studies the impact of the banks' portfolio holdings of financial derivatives on the banks' individual contribution to systemic risk over and above the effect of variables related to size, interconnectedness, substitutability, and other balance sheet information. Using a sample of 95 U.S. bank holding companies from 2002 to 2011, we compare five measures of the banks' contribution to systemic risk and find that the new measure proposed in this study, Net Shapley Value, outperforms the others. Using this measure we find that banks' aggregate holdings of five classes of derivatives do not exhibit a significant effect on the bank's contribution to systemic risk. On the contrary, the banks' holdings of certain specific types of derivatives such as foreign exchange and credit derivatives increase the banks contributions to systemic risk whereas holdings of interest rate derivatives decrease it. Nevertheless, the proportion of non-performing loans over total loans and the leverage ratio have much stronger impact on systemic risk than derivatives holdings. Therefore, the derivatives' impact plays a second fiddle in comparison with traditional banking activities related to the former two items. 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,2014-01-01,51,Journal of Banking and Finance,derivatives; shapley value; systemic risk,"Mayordomo, S.

"Sadok, M.; Katos, V.; Bednar, P.",Developing contextual understanding of information security risks,"Given the uncertainty and complexity of security risk analyses, there is a great need of tools for contextual inquiry supporting assessment of risk with multi-value scales according to different stakeholders' point of view. Such tools can be used at individual level to help develop the understanding of a problem space. At the collective level, they can be used as a mean of communication to support the discussion, comparison and exploration of different understandings. The exploration of multiple perspectives of contextual understanding avoids entrapment in various types of reductionism and eliminates tendencies towards a deterministic reasoning and the pursuit of one optimum solution. A critical challenge is first developing a large spectrum of alternatives and then managing how the differences and similarities between alternatives will be handled to efficiently support decisions in information systems security (ISS). To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper seeks to explore the potential relevance of cognitive maps use in an ISS context to support the exploration of individual understanding leading to richer elaboration of problem spaces.",2014,2014-01-01,3,"Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Human Aspects of Information Security and Assurance, Haisa 2014",cognitive map; cognitive maps; cognitive systems; contextual analysis; contextual understanding; information security; information security risks; information systems security; risk analysis; risk assessment; security of data; systemic risk; systemic risks; uncertainty; uncertainty analysis; uncertainty and complexity,"Sadok, M.

It is clear now, after the crisis of 2008, that the aggregate behavior of the interaction among agents is not straightforward and it is very difficult to predict.

Thisstudy aimed at exploring in vivo the relationship between local endothelial shear stress (ESS) and coronary plaque characteristics in humans using computational fluid dynamics and frequency-domain optical coherence tomography. Methods andThree-dimensional coronary artery reconstruction was performed in 21 patients (24 arteries) presenting with acute coronary syndrome using frequency-domain optical coherence tomography and coronary angiography. Each coronary artery was divided into sequential 3-mm segments and analyzed for the assessment of local ESS and plaque characteristics. A total of 146 nonculprit segments were evaluated. Compared with segments with higher ESS Pascal (Pa)those with low ESS1 Pa) showed higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaques (37.5% versus 20.0% 0.019) and thin-cap fibroatheroma (12.5% versus 2.0% 0.037). Overall, lipid plaques in segments with low ESS had thinner fibrous cap (115 μm 63-166 versus 170 μm 107-219 0.004) and higher macrophage density (normalized standard deviation: 8.4% 4.8-12.6 versus 6.2% 4.2-8.8 0.017). Segments with low ESS showed more superficial calcifications (minimum calcification depth: 93 μm 50-140 versus 152 μm 105-258 0.049) and tended to have higher prevalence of spotty calcifications (26.0% versus 12.0% 0.076).Coronary regions exposed to low ESS are associated with larger lipid burden, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma in humans. Frequency-domain optical coherence tomography-based assessment of ESS and wall characteristics may be useful in identifying vulnerable coronary regions.

"De, J.P.","Fair value accounting, fragile bank balance sheets and crisis: A model","A topic of recent interest in accounting research has been the investigation of the role of fair value accounting (FVA) in the global financial crisis. This research focused on finding a link during the crisis time-period and often states that ""accounting is only a messenger"". The model presented in this paper emphasises finding the link before the crisis and ""accounting as money."" Use is made of an accounting model of the economy due to the inability of standard models of monetary transmission to incorporate global financial crisis characteristics such as feedback effects, systemic risk and the centrality of the financial sector in the crisis. The model shows FVA in banks to be an accelerator that amplifies the financial cycle upswing. Feedback effects noted in the model include changes in the demand for financial instruments and changes in demand in the real economy. Minsky-like, crisis is shown to be endogenous to the model, working through the fragility of balance sheets in the real sector as well as in the financial sector. Bank balance sheet fragility is caused by bad capital driving out good capital, banks reaching for yield and the inversion of the yield curve. The model shows that the practice of not meeting rising credit demand with increasing credit supply is an essential control mechanism in the financial cycle. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,2014-01-01,17,"Accounting, Organizations and Society",,"De Jager, P.

To do this we use regression tree analysis to identify a series of splitting rules that act as risk signals. The empirical findings presented herein prove that contagion, crowded trades, leverage commonality and liquidity concerns are the leading indicators for predicting worst returns.

"Maeno, Y.; Morinaga, S.; Nishiguchi, K.; Matsushima, H.",Impact of credit default swaps on financial contagion,It had been believed in the conventional practice that the risk of a bank going bankrupt is lessened in a straightforward manner by transferring the risk of loan defaults. But the failure of American International Group in 2008 posed a more complex aspect of financial contagion. This study presents an extension of the asset network systemic risk model (ANWSER) to investigate whether credit default swaps mitigate or intensify the severity of financial contagion. A protection buyer bank transfers the risk of every possible debtor bank default to protection seller banks. The empirical distribution of the number of bank bankruptcies is obtained with the extended model. Systemic capital buffer ratio is calculated from the distribution. The ratio quantifies the effective loss absorbency capability of the entire financial system to force back financial contagion. The key finding is that the leverage ratio is a good estimate of a systemic capital buffer ratio as the backstop of a financial system. The risk transfer from small and medium banks to big banks in an interbank network does not mitigate the severity of financial contagion. 2014 IEEE.,2014,2014-01-01,0,"Ieee/iafe Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering, Proceedings (cifer)",bank transfers; credit default swap; empirical distributions; extended model; finance; financial contagions; financial system; intelligent computing; international group; risk assessment; systemic risks,"Maeno, Y.

"Poledna, S.; Thurner, S.; Farmer, J.D.; Geanakoplos, J.",Leverage-induced systemic risk under basle II and other credit risk policies,"We use a simple agent based model of value investors in financial markets to test three credit regulation policies. The first is the unregulated case, which only imposes limits on maximum leverage. The second is Basle II and the third is a hypothetical alternative in which banks perfectly hedge all of their leverage-induced risk with options. When compared to the unregulated case both Basle II and the perfect hedge policy reduce the risk of default when leverage is low but increase it when leverage is high. This is because both regulation policies increase the amount of synchronized buying and selling needed to achieve deleveraging, which can destabilize the market. None of these policies are optimal for everyone: risk neutral investors prefer the unregulated case with low maximum leverage, banks prefer the perfect hedge policy, and fund managers prefer the unregulated case with high maximum leverage.

"Moutot, P.",Macroeconomics and systemic risk: must central bankers go back to their future,"This paper applies to the recent financial crisis and from the viewpoint of the euro area two stylized models with two agents, money, no banks but important financial frictions formerly described in Moutot (2011). As the two models are able to generate high price and premia volatility and respectively illustrate systemic risk through a break-up of the zone and by the impairment of a financial market, the broad lessons they offer help explain the playing out of the crisis globally and in the euro area. As a consequence, it is argued that the consideration of systemic risk is essential to macroeconomics and hence broadens the set of tasks that central bankers must carry out in order to fulfil their price stability mandate.

"Ellul, A.; Jotikasthira, C.; Lundblad, C.T.; Wang, Y.",Mark-to-market accounting and systemic risk: evidence from the insurance industry,"One of the most contentious issues raised during the recent crisis has been the potentially exacerbating role played by mark-to-market accounting. Many have proposed the use of historical cost accounting, promoting its ability to avoid the amplification of systemic risk. We caution against focusing on the accounting rule in isolation, and instead emphasize the interaction between accounting and the regulatory framework. First, historical cost accounting, through incentives that arise via interactions with complex capital adequacy regulation, does generate market distortions of its own. Second, while mark-to-market accounting may indeed generate fire sales during a crisis, forward-looking institutions that rationally internalize the probability of fire sales are incentivized to adopt a more prudent investment strategy during normal times which leads to a safer portfolio entering the crisis. Using detailed, position- and transaction-level data from the US insurance industry, we show that (a) market prices do serve as 'early warning signals', (b) insurers that employed historical cost accounting engaged in greater degrees of regulatory arbitrage before the crisis and limited loss recognition during the crisis, and (c) insurers facing mark-to-market accounting tend to be more prudent in their portfolio allocations. Our identification relies on the sharp difference in statutory accounting rules between life andC companies as well as the heterogeneity in implementation of these rules within each insurance type across US states. Our indicate that regulatory simplicity may be preferred to the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios that gives rise, through interactions with accounting rules, to distorted risk-taking incentives and potential build-up of systemic risk.

"Tymoigne, E.",Measuring macroprudential risk through financial fragility: A minskian approach,"The paper uses the analytical framework developed by Hyman P. Minsky to construct an index of financial fragility for residential housing in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. In the process, a clear difference is made between financial fragility, bubble, and fraud. The goal is to capture the growing interdependence between debt and asset price on the upside. The index is able to capture the rapid growth of financial fragility in residential housing from the early 2000s and an usually high level of financial fragility from 2004 in the United States. However, the construction of the index reveals that the data available are of limited quantity and quality for the purpose at hand. If the Financial Stability Oversight Council is serious about measuring systemic risk, better data about cash flows and loan underwriting should be collected in order to get an idea of the quality of leverage. This quality is measured by focusing on the means used to service debts instead of ability and willingness to service debt per se (i.e. credit risk). 2014 M.E.

"Kleftouri, N.",Meeting the rationale of deposit protection system,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the full potential of an effective deposit insurance system. The current financial crisis in Europe has arguably casted fresh doubt on the role and need for deposit insurance. In this regard, the deposit insurance system’s rationale is a key starting issue in order to fully understand its design and role within a financial safety net system. Design methodology approach Using the UK regulatory regime as the main reference point, the deposit insurance system’sare divided into two broad categories: depositor protection and financial stability. Findings It is argued that a deposit insurance system could only be effective if designed to perform key regulatory s. Otherwise, authorities will keep resorting to other rescue measures, as this system will never be well equipped to respond to a bank failure. Practical implications Notwithstanding recent regulatory reforms, there is still a lack of clearand, thus, a clear profile for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, as the UK deposit compensation scheme. In light of systemic risk and increased demands on prudential banking regulation, the UK deposit insurance system should be reformed to perform significant regulatory s. Social implications The further reform of the UK deposit insurance will enhance depositor protection and financial stability, especially amid the euro-crisis. Originality value An effective reform of deposit insurance requires a clear role-setting for deposit insurance.

"Lu, J.; Hu, X.",Novel three-bank model for measuring the systemic importance of commercial banks,"Relaxing the hypothesis on the scale level of a bank, the present paper develops an improved three-bank model for analyzing the relationship between the size and the systemic importance of a bank. The proposed model is more general and more operational compared with other models. By introducing thefunction based on the multivariate extreme theory and the systemically important index, the effect of the size on the systemic importance of a bank is analyzed. The size is found to be a necessary but insufficient condition for measuring the systemic importance of a bank. The size of a bank plays a critical role in evaluating systemic importance, but when the size reaches a certain threshold, its effect is weakened. The current study has theoretical and practical significance for the recognition and supervision of the systemic importance of banks. 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,2014-01-01,7,Economic Modelling,multivariate extreme theory; size of bank; systemic importance of banks; systemic risk,"Lu, J.

"Cousin, A.; Di, B.E.",On multivariate extensions of conditional-tail-expectation,"In this paper, we introduce two alternative extensions of the classical univariate Conditional-Tail-Expectation (CTE) in a multivariate setting. The two proposed multivariate CTEs are vector-valued measures with the same dimension as the underlying risk portfolio. As for the multivariate Value-at-Risk measures introduced by Cousin and Di Bernardino (2013), the lower-orthant CTE (resp. the upper-orthant CTE) is constructed from level sets of multivariate distribution functions (resp. of multivariate survival distribution functions). Contrary to allocation measures or systemic risk measures, these measures are also suitable for multivariate risk problems where risks are heterogeneous in nature and cannot be aggregated together. Several properties have been derived. In particular, we show that the proposed multivariate CTE-s satisfy natural extensions of the positive homogeneity property, the translation invariance property and the comonotonic additivity property. Comparison between univariate risk measures and components of multivariate CTE is provided. We also analyze how these measures are impacted by a change in marginal distributions, by a change in dependence structure and by a change in risk level. Sub-additivity of the proposed multivariate CTE-s is provided under the assumption that all components of the random vectors are independent.

"Marbukh, V.",On systemic risk in the cloud computing model,The major benefits of the emerging cloud computing infrastructure include elimination of the fixed cost and reduction in the marginal cost for the users due to the economy of scale and dynamic resource sharing. This paper argues that these unquestionable economic benefits of dynamic resource sharing are inherently associated with systemic risks and drawbacks. This possibility necessitates shift in cloud architecture design and operation paradigm from maximizing the economic benefits to managing and optimization of the inherent systemic risk benefit tradeoffs.

"Al-Attas, S.A.",Prevalence of oral and peri-oral lesions among a group of saudi HIV-infected patients,"To investigate the prevalence of oral and peri-oral lesions among a group of Saudi human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.Methods: A cross-sectional controlled study was conducted on 50 HIV-infected Saudi patients from King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital, and 100 healthy individuals recruited from Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between November 2012 to June 2013. All subjects underwent conventional oral examinations to identify mucosal lesions according to the EC-Clearinghouse World Health Organization classifications.: The findings revealed that 68% of the HIV group exhibited HIV-related lesions compared with 4% in the control group. The most commonly observed oral or peri-oral HIV manifestations, which were statistically different between the groups were in descending order, mucosal hyperpigmentation: 28 (56%), candidiasis:(14%), dry lips dry mucosa:(12%), and unilateral or bilateral swelling of major salivary glands:(10%). Other non HIV-related oral lesions that were reported more in the HIV group than the control group was coated tongue and leukoedema (p0.05).Conclusion: Oral mucosal conditions were highly prevalent in HIV-infected patients, which suggested that patients with HIV should undergo periodic oral examinations, and patients with HIV-related lesions should undergo screening tests for HIV infection. 2014, Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

"Rapp, W.V.",Risk management and contractual obligations,"Many financial analysts, policymakers and regulators have forcefully argued that over $700 trillion in derivatives and other contractual risk management tools are a clear and unambiguous good for financial markets and economic growth because they transfer risk from organizations and individuals wanting stability and less volatility managing principal and cash flows to those with stronger more knowledgeable hands managing such risk. This wisdom thus argues that through contracts risk is shifted to those better able to handle these uncertainties while dispersing the risk across more participants. The recent global financial crisis, however, brings these claims and assumptions into doubt. Indeed these financial instruments may add to and concentrate the amount risk that must be managed and regulated rather than transferring it to more and stronger hands. Indeed recent experience with situations such as the near collapse of AIG and the bankruptcy of Lehman has caused regulators to instigate new regulations such as the Volker Rule to limit contractual risk exposure. Further some financial firms have exploited their greater sophistication to shift contractual risk to those with little understanding of the actual risks involved as in Detroit's recent bankruptcy filing. Therefore in explaining how contractual risk occurs this chapter also indicates why the laws and regulations requiring more capital, separate trading entities and the use of exchanges may not be enough to limit global contractual exposures and the related financial systemic risk. 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Moser, B.R.; Wood, R.T.; Hiekata, K.",Risk management in the design of engineering as sociotechnical systems,"This paper reviews risk management as commonly applied in engineering projects, addresses shortcomings, and introduces additional thinking on uncertainty in engineering projects. Despite practices in risk management, unexpected events leading to unacceptable outcomes continue to happen. As practiced, common methods rest upon input measures from experts, in particular to evaluate the probability and effect of a risk. Limitations are well known, including errors, disparate use of qualitative measures, biases and overconfidence, prioritization and focus on local effect rather than systemic value, and meaningless combined exposure scores. By viewing the engineering project as a sociotechnical system, we consider human expertise not as constraint but as fundamental to the system. Rather than removal of human judgment, we seek to position people to leverage existing judgment within limits of relevance while stimulating attention and learning towards systemically relevant options. We propose the design of projects that incorporate human attention in identification and response to risks as learning and coordination within the project's broader sociotechnical architecture. 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.",2014,2014-01-01,0,Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering,concurrent engineering; engineering project; engineering project management; human attention; human expertise; plans; product development; project management; risk; risk assessment; risk management; risks; sociotechnical systems; systemic risk; systemic risks; uncertainty; unexpected events,"Moser, B.R.

This study examined 15-year outcomes among women younger than 40 years treated with breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation therapy (BCT) compared with those treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM).Methods and Materials: Women aged 20 to 39 years with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2003 were identified in a population-based database. Primary outcomes of breast cancerespecific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes of local relapseefree survival (LRFS), locoregional relapseefree survival (LRRFS), and distant relapseefree survival (DRFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between BCT and MRM cohorts using logrank tests. A planned subgroup analysis was performed on patients considered ideal for BCT (ie, T1N0, negative margins and no extensive ductal carcinoma in situ) and in whom local therapy may have the largest impact on survival because of low systemic risk.: 965 patients were identified 616 had BCT and 349 had MRM. The median follow-up time was 14.4 years (range, 8.4-23.3 years). Overall, 15-year rates of BCSS (76.0% vs 74.1%,.62), OS (74.2% vs 73.0%,.75), LRFS (85.4% vs 86.5%,.95), LRRFS (82.2% vs 81.6%,.61), and DRFS (74.4% vs 71.6%,.40) were similar between the BCT and MRM cohorts. In the ideal for BCT subgroup, there were 219 BCT and 67 MRM patients with a median follow-up time of 15.5 years. The 15-year BCSS (86.1% vs 82.9%,.57), OS (82.6% vs 82.9%,.89), LRFS (86.2% vs 84.2%,.50), LRRFS (83.1% vs 78.3%,.24), and DRFS (84.8% vs 79.1%,.17) were similar in the BCT and MRM cohorts.: This population-based analysis with long-term follow-up confirmed that women younger than 40 years treated with BCT had similar 15-year outcomes compared with MRM.

"Kondor, I.; Csabai, I.; Papp, G.; Mones, E.; Czimbalmos, G.; Sándor, M.C.",Strong random correlations in networks of heterogeneous agents,"Correlations and other collective phenomena are considered in a schematic model of pairwise interacting, competing and collaborating agents facing a binary choice and situated at the nodes of the complete graph and a 2-dimensional regular lattice, respectively. The agents may be subjected to an idiosyncratic or common external influence and also some random noise. The system’s stochastic dynamics is studied by numerical simulations. It displays the characteristics of punctuated, multiple equilibria, sensitivity to small details, and path dependence. The dynamics is so slow that one can meaningfully speak of quasi-equilibrium states. Performing measurements of correlations between the agents choices we find that they are random both as to their sign and absolute value, but their distribution is very broad when the interaction dominates both the noise and the external field. This means that random but strong correlations appear with large probability. In the two dimensional model this also implies that the correlations on average fall off with distance very slowly: the system is essentially non-local, small changes at one end may have a strong impact at the other. The strong, random correlations tend to organize a large fraction of the agents into strongly correlated clusters that act together. If we think of this model as a metaphor of social or economic agents or bank networks, the systemic risk implications of this tendency are clear: any impact on even a single strongly correlated agent will not be confined to a small set but will spread, in an unforeseeable manner, to the whole system via the strong random correlations. 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2014,2014-01-01,4,Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination,economics; multi-agent models; social science; statistical mechanics; systemic risk,"Kondor, I.

"Borri, N.; Caccavaio, M.; Giorgio, G.D.; Sorrentino, A.M.",Systemic risk in the italian banking industry,"Systemic risk is the risk of a collapse of the entire financial system, typically triggered by the default of one, or more, interconnected financial institutions. In this paper, we estimate the systemic risk contribution of Italian-listed banks for the period 2000-2011. We follow a methodology first proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier and measure banks' contribution to systemic risk by ΔCoVaR, which measures the contribution of bankto the financial system VaR when bankis in a state of distress. We define 'the system' as the set of Italian-listed banks in the sample. First, we find that the information contained in ΔCoVaR is different from that contained in the VaR. Therefore, regulators should take it into account in order to monitor the systemic risk posed by banks. Second, recent policy debate has focused on the danger posed by large banks and on the need to curb their size. We find that size is indeed the main predictor of a bank contribution to systemic risk. However, in the post-Lehman period, leverage is also an important predictor of systemic risk. Consequently, any financial regulation designed only to curb banks' size could not completely eliminate systemic risk because it is exactly in crisis times that leverage becomes relevant. Hence, we conclude that ΔCoVaR is a very useful policy tool for regulators that can estimate which factors are more relevant in terms of contribution to systemic risk. 2014 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.",2014,2014-01-01,16,Economic Notes,banking; financial policy; financial system; italy; monitoring system; regulatory framework; risk assessment; variance analysis,"Borri, N.

"Klinger, T.; Teplý, P.",Systemic risk of the global banking system an agent-based network model approach,"The global banking system proved significantly vulnerable to systemic risk during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In this paper, we construct an agent-based network model of systemic risk to a banking system, and use it for stress-testing of several different regulatory measures. First, our simulations confirm that sufficient capital buffers in individual banks are crucial for protecting the stability of the whole system. Second, we show that the regulatory measures installed as preventive measures to ensure that the banks possess sufficient capital buffers have almost no positive effects on stability when the system is collapsing. Finally, we highlight various data deficiencies which prevent the researchers and regulators from fully understanding the complete range of systemic risk and make it difficult to devise effective and targeted regulatory measures at this time. 2014 University of EconomicsPrague.

"Balla, E.; Ergen, I.; Migueis, M.",Tail dependence and indicators of systemic risk for large US depositories,"In this study, we investigate the extreme loss tail dependence between stock returns of large US depository institutions. We find that stock returns exhibit strong loss dependence even in their limiting joint extremes. Motivated by this result, we derive extremal dependence-based systemic risk indicators. The proposed systemic risk indicators reflect downturns in the US financial industry very well. We also develop a set of firm-level average extremal dependence measures. We show that these firm-level measures could have been used to identify the firms that were more vulnerable to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Additionally, we explore the performance of selected systemic risk indicators in predicting the crisis performance of large US depository institutions and find that the average stock return correlations are also good predictors of crisis period returns. Finally, we identify factors predictive of extremal dependence for the US depository institutions in a panel regression setting. Strength of extremal dependence increases with asset size and similarity of financial fundamentals. On the other hand, strength of extremal dependence decreases with capitalization, liquidity, funding stability and asset quality. We believe the proposed indicators have the potential to inform the prudential supervision of systemic risk. 2014.",2014,2014-01-01,30,Journal of Financial Stability,extreme value dependence; systemic risk; systemically important financial institutions,"Balla, E.

"Martin, A.; Skeie, D.; Von, T.E.-L.",The fragility of short-term secured funding markets,"This paper develops an infinite-horizon model of financial institutions that borrow short-term and invest in long-term assets that can be traded in frictionless markets. Because these financial intermediaries perform maturity transformation, they are subject to potential runs. We derive distinct liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation constraints, which determine whether a run can occur as a result of changing market expectations. We show that the extent to which borrowers can ward off an individual run depends on whether it has sufficient liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation capacity. These determinants depend on the borrower's (endogenous) balance sheet and on (exogenous) fundamentals. Systemic runs are possible if shocks to the valuation of collateral held by outside investors are sufficiently strong and uniform, and if the system as a whole is exposed to high short-term funding risk. The theory has policy implications for prudential regulation and lender-of-last-resort interventions. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014,2014-01-01,19,Journal of Economic Theory,$investment banking$repurchase agreements$runs$financial fragility$collateral$systemic risk; collateral; financial fragility; investment banking; repurchase agreements; runs; systemic risk,"Martin, A.

"Bell, S.; Hindmoor, A.",The ideational shaping of state power and capacity: winning battles but losing the war over bank reform in the US and UK,"This article extends a recent line of research arguing that the power and capacity of political actors (including states) is not just the product of particular fixed attributes but is also the outcome of political relations between key interlocutors, including ideational relations. State elites, especially government leaders, have persisted with a mindset that still values the economic centrality of a large and complex banking sector. This way of thinking has conditioned the relationship between, on the one hand, the US and UK governments and, on the other, Wall Street and the City of London and has led to a form of 'dysfunctional embeddedness'. Government leaders may have been able to win high-profile policy victories over the banking sector in the post-crisis period, but in accepting a large, complex and constantly evolving financial system with high levels of systemic risk, they have unwittingly placed themselves at a continuing disadvantage in the regulatory arena.

"Papanikolaou, N.I.; Wolff, C.C.P.",The role of on and off-balance-sheet leverage of banks in the late 2000s crisis,"Extensive regulatory changes and technological advances have transformed banking systems to a great extent. Banks have reacted to the challenges posed by the new operating environment by creating new products and expanding their activities to some uncharted business areas. In this paper, we study how modern banking which gave birth to the off-balance-sheet leverage activities affected the risk profile of U.S. banks as well as the level of systemic risk before and after the onset of the late 2000s financial crisis. Towards this, we separate on- from off-balance-sheet leverage and capture the latter with different, yet complementary, measures which do not exist in the current literature. Special attention is paid on the deleveraging process that occurred in the banking market after the crisis erupted, which is an additional innovative feature of this study. Our findings reveal that leverage, both explicit and hidden off-the-balance-sheet, increases the individual risk of banking firms making them vulnerable to financial shocks. Reverse leverage, on the other hand, is beneficial for individual banks' health, but is found to be harmful for financial stability. We also demonstrate that the banks which concentrate on traditional lines of business typically carry less risk compared to those involved with modern financial instruments. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,2014-01-01,36,Journal of Financial Stability,bank leverage; deleveraging process; financial crisis; individual bank risk; systemic risk,"Papanikolaou, N.I.

"Marchetti, J.; Ruta, M.; Teh, R.",Trade imbalances and multilateral trade cooperation,"The years prior to the global financial and economic crisis were marked by rising current account and merchandise trade imbalances. According to some authors, these imbalances either contributed to or precipitated the crisis. And many agree that, to the extent that these large imbalances create systemic risks, it is desirable that they be reduced. One frequently mentioned factor contributing to the build-up of imbalances is persistent exchange rate misalignments, i.e., an exchange rate that is above or below its equilibrium level. But this is not the only one other factors related to macroeconomic, structural and financial policies, are also relevant in that regard. This chapter seeks to examine the contribution that the World Trade Organization (WTO) can make in its three areas of activities negotiations, rule-making and dispute settlement to deal with trade imbalances and with the main factors leading to them, including exchange rate misalignments. Beyond that, this chapter also touches on the need to correct failures in international cooperation, which have allowed such imbalances to pose such a threat to the global economy.

"Benoit, S.",Where is the system,"The aim of this paper is to determine the optimal size of the system (global, supranational or national) when measuring the systemic importance of a bank. Since 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has tagged global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and has imposed a higher regulatory capital of loss absorbency (HLA) requirement. However, the identification of G-SIBs may overlook banks with major domestic systemic importance, i.e. the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs). This paper describes how to adjust market-based systemic risk measures to identify D-SIBs. In an empirical analysis within the eurozone,show that (i) the SRISK methodology produces similar rankings whatever the system used. However, (ii) the SRISK values greatly vary across systems, which calls for imposing the higher of either D-SIB or G-SIB HLA requirements. Finally, (iii) the δCoVaR methodology is extremely sensitive to the choice of the system. 2013 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy.",2014,2014-01-01,7,International Economics,d-sibs; financial regulation; g-sibs; srisk; systemic risk,"Benoit, S.

Our model is an extension of Davis and Lo's infectious default model. We consider an economy offirms that may default directly or may be infected by other defaulting firms (a domino effect also being possible). Spontaneous defaults without external influence and infection are described by not necessarily independent Bernoulli-type random variables. Moreover, several sources of contamination could be required to infect another firm. In this paper we compute the probability distribution function of the total number of defaults in a dependency context. We also give a simple recursive algorithm to compute this distribution in an exchangeability context. Numerical applications illustrate the impact of exchangeability among direct defaults and among contaminations, on different indicators calculated from the law of the total number of defaults. We then calibrate the model on iTraxx data before and during the crisis. The dynamic feature together with the contagion effect have a significant impact on the model performance, especially during the recent distressed period. 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2013,2013-01-01,4,Quantitative Finance,contagion models; credit risk; quantitative finance; systemic risk,"Cousin, A.

Moreover, rules-based regulation, however carefully constructed, will unfortunately never prevent bank failures. Neither should it attempt to do so. An effective overall regulatory regime must be sufficiently comprehensive and well-balanced. It must not put too much emphasis on lowering the probability of individual bank failure. The key components of an effective regulatory regime must be: Basel-type rules robust to off-balance-sheet arbitrage little forbearance in monitoring and supervision by regulatory agencies, with a focus on systemic risk control automatic and quick intervention as well as resolution mechanisms. While all components are necessary, none is sufficient and without strong international coordination, none will be effective. Practical implications Enhanced supervision of banks. Social implications Less costly bank failures.

"Pais, A.; Stork, P.A.",Bank size and systemic risk,"The global financial crisis that started in mid-2007 illustrates the relevance of systemic risk. One key driver of the systemic instability that materialised in the crisis was the elevated level of stress in large banks. We use EVT to analyse the effect of size on banks' univariate and systemic risk across ten countries as well as across the EU. Our findings show that size has little impact on banks' univariate risk (as measured by VaR), but that large banks have significantly higher systemic risk. Furthermore, systemic risk has significantly increased for banks of all sizes since the beginning of the crisis. 2011 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",2013,2013-01-01,41,European Financial Management,banks; extreme value theory; systemic risk; too big to fail,"Pais, A.

"Jarrow, R.","Capital adequacy rules, catastrophic firm failure, and systemic risk","This paper studies capital adequacy rules based on Value-at-Risk (VaR), leverage ratios, and stress testing. VaR is the basis of Basel II, and all three approaches are proposed in Basel III. This paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we prove that these three rules provide an incentive to increase the probability of catastrophic financial institution failure. Collectively, these rules provide an incentive to increase (not decrease) systemic risk. Second, we argue that an unintended consequence of the Basel II VaR capital adequacy rules was the 2007 credit crisis. Third, we argue that to reduce systemic risk, a new capital adequacy rule is needed.

However, advanced age is associated with decreased physiologic reserve capacity and significant comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease and chronic lung disease. These factors and effects of systemic inflammatory response associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on organs and systems have a greater impact on morbidity and mortality in older patients than the younger ones. As a result, for elderly patients with additional multi-systemic risks, cardiac surgery is a real trauma with its own multisystemic effects. It requires a specific and careful approach in terms of surgery and anesthesia. The adverse effects of CPB on the organ systems which are traumatized by aging and associated illnesses should be well-established and examined together.

A massive investment shift from fossil to non-fossil fuels could offset sub-par economic growth and high unemployment in the developed economies caused by the financial crisis and aggravated by demographic trends and the shift of economic dynamism to emerging markets. The 2008 and dot.com crises demonstrate that our financial system is inherently unstable and that ""bubbles"" are not only inevitable but occur at shorter intervals and inhibit long-term investment. Financing massive investment in non-fossil fuels could be done, however, with long-term securities whose rate of return, based on exergy efficiency improvement, would attract global institutional investors with long-term investment needs.

"Duncan, A.S.; Kabundi, A.",Domestic and foreign sources of volatility spillover to south african asset classes,"The paper characterises domestic and foreign sources of volatility transmission for South African (SA) bonds, commodities, currencies, and equities. We introduce a small-open-economy extension of the volatility spillover model proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Based on generalised variance decompositions (Pesaran and Shin, 1998) of a vector autoregressive model, this approach combines bidirectional spillovers exchanged by domestic assets with volatility injections imported from shocks to the global financial system. The analysis relates to a sample of daily observations ranging from October 1996 to June 2010. The estimated spillover levels are time-varying, and increase during domestic and foreign crises. Average domestic spillovers of 38% exceed average foreign spillovers of 4.7%, and maximum domestic spillovers estimated for the United States for a similar sample period (Diebold and Yilmaz, 2012). These findings suggest a high degree of systemic risk in SA and, furthermore, that this risk is predominantly related to country-specific factors.

"Avgouleas, E.",Effective governance of global financial markets: an evolutionary plan for reform,"Two questions remain widely open when it comes to global financial markets. First, what is the raison d' tre of open global markets Second, is it possible to foster open markets without an international governance structure supervising them Post-crisis regulatory reform presents an acute paradox. While the content of international financial regulation is changing rapidly, the reform of governance structures is painfully slow. There is no formal governance structure dealing with cross-border supervision of global financial institutions. In addition, there is no crystallized institutional capacity at the international level dealing with cross-border crises and the resolution of global institutions. Other areas of concern are the global supervision of systemic risk and the absence of a reliable finance research watchdog dealing with the production of regulatory standards. This article outlines an international governance framework to deal effectively with these concerns. The adoption of the proposed plan would lead to breaking down the territorial link in the supervision of large financial institutions and of systemic risk, without causing intolerable loss of sovereignty. In addition, the proposed structure is premised on a set of explicit values. These would provide a strong signal to global markets that they need to shift their focus from speculation to development goals. 2013 University of Durham and John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",2013,2013-01-01,5,Global Policy,,"Avgouleas, E.

"Challe, E.; Mojon, B.; Ragot, X.",Equilibrium risk shifting and interest rate in an opaque financial system,"We analyse the risk-taking behaviour of heterogenous intermediaries that are protected by limited liability and choose both their amount of leverage and the risk exposure of their portfolio. Due to the opacity of the financial sector, outside providers of funds cannot distinguish ""prudent"" intermediaries from those ""imprudent"" ones that voluntarily hold high-risk portfolios and expose themselves to the risk of bankrupcy. We show how the number of imprudent intermediaries is determined in equilibrium jointly with the interest rate, and how both ultimately depend on the cross-sectional distribution of intermediaries' capital. One implication of our analysis is that an exogenous increase in the supply of funds to the intermediary sector lowers interest rates and raises the number of imprudent intermediaries. Another one is that easy financing may lead an increasing number of intermediaries to gamble for resurection following a bad shock to the sector's capital, again raising economywide systemic risk. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,2013-01-01,6,European Economic Review,capital; correlation; financial opacity; financial services; financial system; interest rate; portfolio correlation; risk assessment; risk shifting,"Challe, E.

This builds on the modelling paradigm of Eisenberg and Noe Eisenberg L, Noe TH (2001) Systemic risk in financial systems. Management Sci. 47(2):236-249 by introducing costs of default if loans have to be called in by a failing bank. This immediately introduces novel and realistic effects. We find that, in general, many different clearing vectors can arise, among which there is a greatest clearing vector, arrived at by letting banks fail in succession until only solvent banks remain. Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks. We conclude with some remarks about how a rescue consortium might be constructed. 2013 INFORMS.",2013,2013-01-01,179,Management Science,bank failure; contagion; financial system; interbank market; interbank network; management; management science; merger; systemic risks,"Rogers, L.C.G.

"Summer, M.",Financial contagion and network analysis,"Network models of interbank exposures allow the mapping of the complex web of financial linkages among many institutions and address issues of system stability and contagion risk. Although existing models cover a fair amount of ground in explaining how network structure can lead to default cascades and in quantifying the likelihood and the impact of default cascades through balance-sheet mechanics, the literature has shortcomings in explaining how shocks are potentially amplified through the network of exposures. These amplification mechanisms seem to be very important in financial crises. This review discusses the main conceptual ideas behind network models of contagion, the major findings of this literature, as well as some limitations of existing models.

"Aras, G.; Yobas, B.",Governance in capital market institutions,"The governance of capital market institutions did not receive much interest compared to their banking sector counterparts, partly due to their different ownership structures. Recent trends increased competition, technological advances, structural changes, globalization, all had their share of impact on governance systems of capital markets institutions particularly on exchanges. Corporate governance of non-financial firms and capital markets institutions differ in several ways. Firstly the role of risk management differs since they may impose systemic risks to the financial system. Secondly well-implemented governance structures and processes are required but are not sufficient in capital markets since there are several conflicts of interests to be addressed. Therefore whether and how effectively they function is what matters. Thirdly the governance structures of such institutions exhibit different effectiveness on their decisions. The governance of FIs in capital markets is discussed in terms of board structure and management, risk governance, supervisors, shareholders, executive compensation, role of regulators, authorities and values and culture. The role of stock exchanges in corporate governance are discussed separately in terms of implementing corporate governance codes, demutualisation and its impact on regulations, transparency and accountability issues and the effects ofAs among exchanges. Market needs strong analytical tools and reliable benchmarks to assess governance risk. The corporate control and the regulation of the institutions by the exchanges when the corporations (regulated) are the competitors of the exchanges (regulators) or owned by the stockholders of the exchanges must be addressed. The risk of regulatory arbitrage, calls for the need of harmonisation among regulators. Better regulation of FIs and greater global coordination among regulators are seen as the most two important issues to prevent another crisis.

"Tessone, C.J.; Garas, A.; Guerra, B.; Schweitzer, F.",How big is too big critical shocks for systemic failure cascades,"External or internal shocks may lead to the collapse of a system consisting of many agents. If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to fail, this can induce a cascade of failures among neighboring agents. Several critical constellations determine whether this cascade affects the system in part or as a whole which, in the second case, leads to systemic risk. We investigate the critical parameters for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are characterized by an individual threshold θi determining their capacity to handle a load αθi with 1-α being their safety margin. If agents fail, they redistribute their load equally toneighboring agents in a regular network. For three different threshold distributions P(θ), we derive analytical for the size of the cascade, X(t), which is regarded as a measure of systemic risk, and the time when it stops. We focus on two different regimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the size of the shock is of the order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii) RIE, a random internal event where the size of the shock is of the order of the capacity of an agent. We find that even for large extreme events that exceed the capacity of the network finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold distribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations may lead to full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the size of the ""big"" shock is not the problem, as the systemic risk only varies slightly for changes in the number of initially failing agents, the safety margin and the threshold distribution, which further gives hints on how to reduce systemic risk. 2013 Springer Science Business Media New York.",2013,2013-01-01,16,Journal of Statistical Physics,cascading dynamics; systemic risk,"Tessone, C.J.

We investigate the problem of robustness of such systems in the context of the general theory of dynamical stability in complex networks and, in particular, how the topology of connections influence the risk of the failure of a single institution triggering a cascade of successive collapses propagating through the network. We use data on bilateral liabilities (or exposure) in the derivatives market between 202 financial intermediaries based in USA and Europe in the last quarter of 2009 to empirically investigate the network structure of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market.We observe that the network exhibits both heterogeneity in node properties and the existence of communities. It also has a prominent core-periphery organization and can resist large-scale collapse when subjected to individual bank defaults (however, failure of any bank in the core may result in localized collapse of the innermost core with substantial loss of capital) but is vulnerable to system-wide breakdown as a result of an accompanying liquidity crisis.

"Zhang, Y.-L.; Frangos, J.A.; Chachisvilis, M.",Mechanotransduction by membrane-mediated activation of g-protein coupled receptors and g-proteins,", the leading cause of death in the Western world and nearly the leading cause in other developing countries, is associated with systemic risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia (Malek et al., 1999a). Nonetheless, it is clearly a focal disease with atherosclerotic lesions forming in the coronary arteries, major branches of the aortic arch, and the abdominal aorta. Plaque formation preferentially involves the outer walls of vessel bifurcations and points of blood flow recirculation, where hemodynamic shear stress is weaker than in unaffected areas. Detailed analysis of fluid mechanics in these areas revealed a strong spatial correlation between endothelial dysfunction plaque formation and low mean shear stress and oscillatory flow with recirculation (Nerem, 1992 Malek et al., 1999a). It has been suggested that low mean shear stress and nonlaminar flow stimulate the formation of an atherogenic phenotype (Gibson et al., 1993 Ku et al., 1985) while arterial level shear stress15 dynes cm2) stimulates atheroprotective gene expression profile and cellular responses that are essential for normal endothelial function (Harrison, 2005 Cunningham and Gotlieb, 2005), implying that the maintenance of physiological, laminar shear stress on endothelial cells is crucial for normal vascular function (Traub and Berk, 1998). The development of atherogenesis can be studied at various levels however, the origins of the disease have been linked to mechanosensing by a number of studies (Ku et al., 1985 Glagov et al., 1988 Svindland, 1983 Debakey et al., 1985 White et al., 2003), suggesting that investigations at the molecular level are required for further understanding of the atherogenesis.

"McPherson, C.",National oil companies: ensuring benefits and avoiding systemic risks,"This chapter addresses the multi-faceted role and nature of national oil companies (NOCs). Having come to play an important role in almost all resource-rich countries to date, NOCs influence domestic development through their impact on macro-economic management, investment, and overall governance. At the same time, how well they perform has major implications for global energy supply and security. The chapter argues that it is important to provide a nuanced assessment of NOCs. NOCs that perform well will enhance oil sector performance and, whilst serving domestic economic policies and governance, contribute importantly to domestic sustainable development and stability. Yet, the chapter argues, it is imperative to avoid the apparent systemic risks for global oil markets associated with NOCs. The call on global energy policy therefore consists in ensuring NOC performance, which requires both domestic and international political will, i.e., commitment at the highest levels to the support of institutional capacity, transparency, and accountability. 2013 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

"Kobayashia, T.",Network versus portfolio structure in financial systems,"The question of how to stabilize financial systems has attracted considerable attention since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. Recently, Beale et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108, 12647 (2011) demonstrated that higher portfolio diversity among banks would reduce systemic risk by decreasing the risk of simultaneous defaults at the expense of a higher likelihood of individual defaults. In practice, however, a bank default has an externality in that it undermines other banks' balance sheets. This paper explores how each of these different sources of risk, simultaneity risk and externality, contributes to systemic risk. The show that the allocation of external assets that minimizes systemic risk varies with the topology of the financial network as long as asset returns have negative correlations. In the model, a well-known centrality measure, PageRank, reflects an appropriately defined ""infectiveness"" of a bank. An important result is that the most infective bank needs not always to be the safest bank. Under certain circumstances, the most infective node should act as a firewall to prevent large-scale collective defaults. The of a counteractive portfolio structure will significantly reduce systemic risk.

"Duff, A.W.S.; Zaring, D.",New paradigms and familiar tools in the new derivatives regulation,"Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act is a study in contrasts. On the one hand, Dodd-Frank transforms the U.S. approach to derivatives regulation from a lasses-faire, almost no oversight paradigm into one featuring heavy supervision, supervision focused on the safety and soundness of derivatives markets participants. The commitments to capital and margin requirements, clearinghouses and international cooperation reflect a European vision of financial intermediaries as heavily regulated utilities, rather than the more traditionally American willingness to tolerate the speculative aspects of capital markets. On the other hand, the tools that Dodd-Frank employs to pursue safety and soundness draw inspiration from those that private market actors have employed for centuries. Adopting a more heavily regulated banking paradigm for the formerly (mostly) unregulated derivatives markets, but using market based tools to advance the goals of safety and soundness, might seem like two regulatory reforms working at cross-purposes. However, it may be a sign that real changes in the United States' vision of well-functioning derivatives markets-providing options for sophisticated investors, but not ones laden with hidden systemic risk-are being pursued incrementally, even after comprehensive regulatory reform.",2013,2013-01-01,9,George Washington Law Review,,"Duff, A.W.S.

In this review, we describe our current knowledge on the role of Nuclear Receptors in atherosclerosis, which is a multifactorial disease of the vessel wall. Various cell types are involved in this chronic inflammatory pathology in which multiple cellular processes and numerous genes are dysregulated. Systemic risk factors for atherosclerosis are among others adverse blood lipid profiles, enhanced circulating cytokine levels, as well as increased blood pressure. Since many Nuclear Receptors modulate lipid profiles or regulate blood pressure they indirectly affect atherosclerosis. In the present review, we focus on the functional involvement of Nuclear Receptors within the atherosclerotic vessel wall, more specifically on their modulation of cellular functions in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages.

"Chinazzi, M.; Fagiolo, G.; Reyes, J.A.; Schiavo, S.",Post-mortem examination of the international financial network,"As the recent crisis has forcefully suggested, understanding financial-market interconnectedness is of a paramount importance to explain systemic risk, stability and economic dynamics. In this paper, we address these issues along two related perspectives. First, we explore the statistical properties of the International Financial Network (IFN), defined as a weighted-directed graph where nodes are countries and links represent debtor-creditor relationships in equities and short long-run debt. We investigate whether the 2008 financial crisis has resulted in a significant change in the topological properties of the IFN. Our findings suggest that the crisis caused not only a reduction in the amount of securities traded, but also induced changes in the topology of the network and in the time evolution of its statistical properties. This has happened, however, without changing the disassortative, core-periphery structure of the IFN architecture. Second, we perform an econometric study to examine the ability of network-based measures to explain cross-country differences in crisis intensity. We investigate whether the conclusion of previous studies showing that international connectedness is not a relevant predictor of crisis intensity may be reversed, once one explicitly accounts for the position of each country within the IFN. We show that higher interconnectedness reduces the severity of the crisis, as it allows adverse shocks to dissipate quicker. However, being central in the network may make countries that are not members of a rich club more vulnerable in times of crisis. Finally, we find strong evidence of nonlinear effects, once the high degree of heterogeneity that characterizes the IFN is taken into account. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,2013-01-01,75,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,crisis; early warning systems; financial networks,"Chinazzi, M.

"McKinstry, L.",Regulating a global market: the extraterritorial challenge of dodd-frank's margin requirements for uncleared OTC derivatives a mutual recognition solution,"The OTC derivatives market is fluid, global and characterized by cross-border transactions. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act aims to reduce systemic risk inherent in this market, which exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis, by imposing various requirements upon market participants, including margin requirements on uncleared OTC derivatives. Margin requirements protect against potential losses from counterparty default by requiring parties to exchange payments as collateral for their obligations under a derivative contract. Yet because much of the OTC market consists of cross-border transactions, which implicate multiple regulatory regimes, inadequate coordination with other jurisdictions could lead to regulatory arbitrage, gaps or conflicts and undermine the goals of this regulatory requirement. Moreover, the extraterritoriality provisions of Title VII, as analyzed in light of recent case law, indicate that the jurisdictional scope of Dodd-Frank's margin requirements may be ambiguous and uneven. To avoid the dangers of inconsistent regulatory standards, minimize legal uncertainty and reduce systemic risk in the OTC derivatives market, foreign and domestic regulators should strive for application of comparable domestic margin regimes to cross-border uncleared OTC derivatives contracts in the context of mutual recognition. Mutual recognition is a method of international regulatory coordination that entails an agreement among two or more countries to recognize the adequacy of each other's regulation as an equivalent substitute for their own.",2013,2013-01-01,3,Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,,"McKinstry, L.

"Petersen, M.A.; Senosi, M.C.; Mukuddem-Petersen, J.",Subprime banking models,"Many analysts believe that problems in the U.S. housing market initiated the 2008-2010 global financial crisis. In this regard, the subprime mortgage crisis (SMC) shook the foundations of the financial industry by causing the failure of many iconic Wall Street investment banks and prominent depository institutions. This crisis stymied credit extension to households and businesses thus creating credit crunches and, ultimately, a global recession. This book specifically discusses the SMC and its components, causes, consequences and cures in relation to subprime loan extension and securitization, risk and regret, data as well as bank bailouts. In particular, the SMC has highlighted the fact that risk, credit ratings, profit and valuation as well as capital regulation are important banking considerations. With regard to risk, the book discusses credit (including counterparty), market (including interest rate, basis, prepayment, liquidity and price), tranching (including maturity mismatch and synthetic), operational and systemic risks. The book introduces the IDIOM hypothesis that postulates that the SMC was largely caused by the intricacy and design of subprime loan extension and securitization that led to information problems (dispersion and asymmetry), opaqueness and ineffective risk mitigation. It also contains appropriate examples, discussions, timelines as well as appendices about the main on the aforementioned topics. Numerous references point to the material not covered in the book, and indicate some avenues for further research. In order to understand the key a working knowledge of discrete-time stochastic modeling and optimization is required. The book is one of the first to approach the SMC from a mainly theoretical- rather than a numerical-quantitative or qualitative viewpoint. It is primarily intended for financial industry role players, researchers as well as students and staff at academic institutions. 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"Kurosaki, T.; Kim, Y.S.",Systematic risk measurement in the global banking stock market with time series analysis and covar,"Motivated by the growing importance of systemic risk in the global banking system, the authors measure the risk of the system and the marginal contributions of the institutions in several ways in terms of stock markets. The undiversifiable risk appearing in specific market sectors is called systematic risk rather than systemic risk. The paper focuses on global banking stocks comprising global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs), and discusses the global systematic risk measurement. To forecast future joint distribution of returns, the authors utilize the multivariate autoregressive moving average generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) model with the multivariate normal tempered stable (MNTS) distributed and multivariate normal distributed innovations. This work statistically demonstrates that the ARMA-GARCH model with the MNTS distributed innovations is a more realistic model for G-SIFI stocks. In line with previous studies, the authors estimate four systematic risk measures: joint probability and conditional probability of negative stock return movements, ΔCoVaR, and ΔCoAVaR. It is found that the joint probability of negative movements is a good indicator for a significant increase in systematic risk. Subsequently, the authors investigate the relationship among the other three measures and find the following. Crosssectional linkages between AVaR and ΔCoAVaR are few, if any, but there is a strong time series linkage. On the other hand, the conditional probability of negative movements and ΔCoAVaR show similar cross-sectional magnitude relations, though their time series linkage is not clear. Thus, both AVaR and conditional probability of negative movements reinforce each other and serve a useful reference for ΔCoAVaR-based systematic risk measurement.

"Corcoran, C.",Systemic liquidity risk and bipolar markets: wealth management in today's macro risk on risk off financial environment,"The dramatic and well chronicled crisis of 2007marked a watershed moment for all stakeholders in global capital markets. In the aftermath, financial markets have become even more tightly coupled as correlations in returns across multiple asset classes have been at historically elevated levels. Investors and fund managers are, to a much larger degree than previously and often much more than they realize, subject to the risk of severe wealth destruction. The ultimate hazard, which is not adequately characterized by the widely touted notion of tail risk, is the systemic risk which arises when liquidity in markets completely evaporates. Not only did this happen in the second half of 2008, but it has been repeated episodically since thenmost notably in May 2010, in an incident known as the Flash Crash, and in the fall of 2011 when correlations were at historically elevated levels. Conventional asset allocation tools and techniques have failed to keep apace with the changing financial landscape which has emerged since 2008. In addition to the preponderance of algorithmic trading and the associated changes in the liquidity characteristics of financial markets, a new paradigm of risk on risk off asset allocation has emerged. Risk on risk off is a widely adopted style of trading and macro allocation strategy where positions are taken in several closely aligned asset classes depending on the prevailing sentiment or appetite for risk. The consequences of the day to day (and intraday) switching between either a risk on or risk off tactical strategies poses significant new challenges to investors who are still making investment decisions with outmoded notions from traditional asset allocation theory. How can one cushion the impact of systemically threatening events when the ability to exit financial instruments becomes almost non existent How can one trust the integrity of financial models and orthodox macro financial theory which have become increasingly discredited Can central bankers be relied upon to become the counter-parties of last resort and provide a safety net under the financial system These vital questions, and many others, need to be addressed by everyone who has a stake in modern financial markets, and they are addressed in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets. Proper functioning markets require fractiousness or divided opinion, and this needs to be lubricated by communications from central bankers, economic forecasters, corporate executives and so on. As long as such messages and market conditions remain ambiguous, providing asymmetric information to different market players, then the conditions are present to enable systemic liquidity to be preserved. Seen in this context the prevailing paradigm of bipolar risk on risk off asset allocations is both a prerequisite to liquid markets, and also paradoxically, when one side of the polarity becomes too extreme, a major source of systemic instability. Should such polarities become critically unbalanced, and should the signals received by market players become symmetrically disadvantageous as they were in the fall of 2008, then an even more substantial systemic liquidity crisis than that seen in those troubled times is a dangerous possibility. Apart from the practical risk management tools and tactics that are recommended in Systemic Liquidity Risk and Bipolar Markets, there is a provocative and cogent narrative to provide anxious and perplexed investors with a coherent explanation of the post GFC financial environment, and which should assist them in navigating the choppy waters ahead. 2013 Clive Corcoran.

"Lee, S.H.",Systemic liquidity shortages and interbank network structures,"This paper aims to shed light on the systemic nature of liquidity risk and to propose a method for calculating systemic liquidity shortages. Our method incorporates not only direct liquidity shortages but also indirect liquidity shortages due to the knock-on effects through interbank linkages. We perform a simulation with a simple banking system model and find that a deficit bank can mitigate a liquidity shortage by holding more claims on a surplus bank. Meanwhile, a greater imbalance in liquidity positions across banks tends to aggravate the liquidity shortage of a deficit bank. According to comparative analysis between different types of network structures, a core-periphery network with a deficit money center bank gives rise to the highest level of systemic liquidity shortage, and a banking system becomes more vulnerable to liquidity shocks as its interbank network becomes more ill-matched. 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013,2013-01-01,43,Journal of Financial Stability,interbank network; knock-on effect; liquidity shortage; systemic risk,"Lee, S.H.

Aggregated Distance-to-Default series are generated using option prices information from systemically important banks and the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index. These indicators provide methodological advantages in monitoring vulnerabilities in the banking system over time: (1) they capture interdependence and joint risk of distress in systemically important banks (2) their forward-looking feature endow them with early signaling properties compared to traditional approaches in the literature and other market-based indicators (3) they produce simultaneously smooth and informative long-term signals and quick and clear reaction to market distress and (4) they incorporate additional information through option prices about tail risk and correlation breaks, in line with recent findings in the literature. 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2013,2013-01-01,22,Journal of Financial Stability,banking crises; contingent claims analysis; systemic risk,"Saldías, M.

Following this idea, the purpose of this research is to reinforce a comparative study on small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) handling both risk and crisis management according to a new tailored model of a balance scorecard (BS). This new model of risk and crisis management aims at improving both SMEs' management adaptation and performance across all of crisis' stages, something not attempted so far in the literature. Design methodology approach: The application of such a BS comes from the author's experience as a banker financing various SMEs industries, as a bank consultant on risk management, yet primarily from the of a survey performed on a set of Romanian and Cypriot SMEs, equal-proportionally selected from the area of trading, manufacturing, and services. The data regard the period 12 2008-06 2011 as representative for the latest global financial crisis affecting the entire European Union region, too. Findings: Coincidently or not, this study's show a significant improvement of the financial performance of the SMEs who employed this model compared to those who did not. Originality value: This model's simplicity appeals to managers and regulators in understanding important business risks and crisis related phenomena.

"Cirillo, P.; Gallegati, M.; HÜsler, J.",Alya lattice model to study leverage dynamics and contagious financial fragility,"We discuss a speciallya lattice model to study cascading failures of firms in a simple industrial economy. In particular, every firm is represented by alya-like urn, whose reinforcement is function of time, of the neighboring urns and their compositions, and of a random variable representing systemic risk or fate. The simple idea is to build the dependence among firms by assuming simple balance sheet rules on debts and credits. In detail we assume that the debts of every company are credits for some of its neighbors. Debts and credits are represented by different balls in the urns firms. At the same time we assume that the riskiness of every firm also depends on the economic wealth of its neighbors and of the economy in general. These simple rules are sufficient to create business cycles, in which the accumulation of debts pushes the economy towards frequent crises. The model can be easily simulated and the we obtain encourage the development of brand new finitary probabilistic approaches to study firms' behavior and dynamics. 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2012,2012-01-01,10,Advances in Complex Systems,cascading failures; contagion; financial fragility; gev; ising models; networks; power law; pólya urn,"Cirillo, P.

"Worrell, C.A.",An analytic environment for systemic riskrisk modeling support for financial policy makers,"Systemic risk in the U.S. financial system has drawn the attention of leaders in government and business alike. The abundance of systemic risk measures and risk models has added to the complex task of understanding, discussing, and acting on the implications of that risk. Tools that assist decision makers to interpret risk measures, and recognize their underlying assumptions may lead to deeper understanding and more effective discussion. This paper describes some initial considerations for building an integrated modeling and analysis environment to aid in assessing complex financial data. The modeling environment is engineered to support execution of quantitative models including agent based and network models against equivalent scenarios of economic conditions. The environment provides tools to compare and visualize model outputs, and to allow decision makers to maintain traceability from model outputs back to their underlying assumptions. This capability may facilitate the operation of a modeling forum where disparate teams of analysts can collaborate to provide insights into the nation's exposure to systemic financial risk. 2012 IEEE.",2012,2012-01-01,1,"2012 Ieee Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering and Economics, Cifer 2012 - Proceedings",agent based; artificial intelligence; communication effectiveness; complex task; computational modeling; computer simulation; decision makers; decision making; economic condition; financial data; financial risks; financial system; integrated modeling; interconnected systems; large scale systems; model outputs; modeling environments; multi-level systems; multilevel systems; network models; policy makers; quantitative models; risk assessment; risk measures; risk model; risk modeling,"Worrell, C.A.

"Vaziri, M.; Bhuyan, R.; Manuel, P.A.V.",Comparative predictability of failure of financial institutions using multiple models,"The impact of failure of financial institutions is beyond just the failure of a public corporation. The failure of financial institutions in the USA, is a clear evidence that the greater macro impact is beyond just the failure of few financial institutions. It can bring down the entire economy and can have global devastating impact. By realizing the grave systemic risk of the failure, US government is forced to intervene and bail out many institutions for greater macroeconomic reasons. It raises the view that perhaps the current regulating policies and methods are lacking efficiency in predicting the possibility of failure beforehand and hence are not effective in preventing that to happen. This research applies several existing methods of institutional failure and test the signaling ability of each method in predicting the bankruptcy beforehand. The authors apply Moody's financial ratios, Standard and Poor's financial ratio, Vaziri's financial ratio, Altman'sscore and then applying logit model and discriminant analysis, the authors test each of these model's predictive ability for future use. The paper analyzes the reasons like changes in market, policy, economy, and political influence which have led to bankruptcy. Banks or financial institutions from Europe, the United States and Asia are considered as samples. Samples are taken from the same period to analyze the effect of different methods. The from this analysis should help us find the most significant method that could be used to identify the risk, so that necessary action could be taken to prevent the effect or reject the project which could lead to bankruptcy in the future. This research would also offer policy recommendations for regulating agencies as to which factors should be analyzed deeply and how to implement a preventive measure ahead of any potential problems.

"Murphy, E.V.",Credit default swaps: frequently asked questions,"Credit default swaps are contracts that provide protection against default by third parties, similar to insurance. These financial derivatives are used by banks and other financial institutions to manage risk. The rapid growth of the derivatives market, the potential for widespread credit defaults (such as defaults for subprime mortgages), and operational problems in the over-the-counter (OTC) market where credit default swaps are traded, have led some policymakers to inquire if credit default swaps are a danger to the financial system and the economy. For example, the establishment of a conservatorship for the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in September 2008 potentially triggered credit default swap contracts with notional value exceeding $1.2 trillion. Processing and covering these commitments may be difficult. This chapter defines credit default swaps, explains their use by banks for risk management, and discusses the potential for systemic risk.",2012,2012-01-01,0,Economic Crises as a Result of Distrust,,"Murphy, E.V.

"Allen, J.L.",Derivatives clearinghouses and systemic risk: A bankruptcy and dodd-frank analysis,"This Note analyzes the effectiveness of derivatives clearinghouses in decreasing systemic risk upon a counterparty default. The analysis first explains how a derivatives clearinghouse can successfully reduce systemic risk by analyzing LCH.Clearnet's management of the Lehman default in 2008. Next, the analysis demonstrates that if a clearinghouse could not manage a default and became insolvent, systemic risk would greatly increase. Rather than containing the impact of a counterparty default, an insolvent clearinghouse would enhance systemic risk because the two existing resolution regimes, the Bankruptcy Code and the Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority, could not successfully unwind the institution. The primary contribution of this Note is identifying that an insolvent derivatives clearinghouse creates an unsolvable problem with respect to resolution: untangling the derivatives trades will inevitably take more than a day, but if sorting out the portfolios takes even a few days, clearing members will start a run on the clearinghouse. The resulting enhanced systemic risk would necessitate government intervention. A major derivatives clearinghouse would be too big to fail. Accordingly, this Note proposes two recommendations to ensure that derivatives clearinghouses effectively reduce systemic risk. Regulators should: (1) minimize the risk of clearinghouse insolvency through strict collateral, capital, and default management requirements, and (2) create an ex ante guarantee fund to serve as a government backstop and provide liquidity to an insolvent derivatives clearinghouse, thereby avoiding enhanced systemic risk.",2012,2012-01-01,19,Stanford Law Review,,"Allen, J.L.

"Allen, L.; Bali, T.G.; Tang, Y.",Does systemic risk in the financial sector predict future economic downturns,"We derive a measure of aggregate systemic risk, designated CATFIN, that complements bank-specific systemic risk measures by forecasting macroeconomic downturns six months into the future using out-of-sample tests conducted with U.S., European, and Asian bank data. Consistent with bank ""specialness,the CATFIN of both large and small banks forecasts macroeconomic declines, whereas a similarly defined measure for both nonfinancial firms and simulated ""fake banks"" has no marginal predictive ability. High levels of systemic risk in the banking sector impact the macroeconomy through aggregate lending activity. A conditional asset pricing model shows that CATFIN is priced for financial and nonfinancial firms. The Author 2012.

"Nadarajah, S.; Kon, C.; Rassam, S.",Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with the aid of an expanding gas bubble and risk factors,"Purpose: To assess the visual outcome after massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage managed by early controlled drainage using the aid of an intravitreal expanding gas bubble (100% perfluoropropane). The ocular and systemic risk factors were also reviewed. Methods: Data were obtained retrospectively from patients with massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage who were treated in Worthing and Southlands National Health Service Trust between January 2003 and December 2008.The study included 10 patients (5 women andmen) with a mean age of 73.9 years (range, 54-84 years). All patients underwent early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 100% perfluoropropane as a tamponade. The mean interval of drainage from the onset was 3.5 days (range, 1-10 days). Anatomical restoration of ocular structures was achieved inpatients, with good final visual outcome at meanmonths (range, 6-14 months). The remaining three patients had poor visual outcome because of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The most common risk factor in this case series was glaucoma, which was seen in five patients. Arteriosclerosis was the only risk factor in two patients. Conclusion: Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with 100% perfluoropropane tamponade may help in achieving a good visual outcome. The use of 100% perfluoropropane has the advantage of maintaining positive pressure while facilitating controlled drainage of the hemorrhage as the clot lyses. Retinal detachment however is a poor prognostic indicator. Arteriosclerosis and glaucoma were the most common risk factors seen in this case series.

"Weiming, H.; Zhongfu, L.",Empirical research of systemic risks of REITs on MGARCH model,"In last ten years the outstanding performance of Hong Kong REITs attracted world's-wide attention. However, since the sub prime crisis, it is believed by investors and regulators that the systemic risk of Hong Kong REITs could increase gradually, and the value of REITs could decrease gradually. This paper seeks to confirm whether the systemic risk of Asia REITs changes in the sub prime crisis or not. MGARCH model is applied to analyze the co-movement between all Hong Kong REITs and the Hang Seng stock market over the past five years. The empirical show that: the condition covariances of Hong Kong REITs do have a measure of incensement during the sub prime crisis, and quickly turn to the level of low-risk securities after the sub prime crisis. At the same time, the time-varying beta values are relatively low in the five years. These demonstrate that the systemic risk of REITs does not change in the sub prime crisis, and remains at a relatively low level. Therefore, Hong Kong REIT is still a kind of the investment tool with stabile income and low risk.

"Saunders, A.; Walter, I.","Financial architecture, systemic risk, and universal banking","Consolidation has been a fact of life in the wholesale financial services sector, resulting in fundamental change in the financial architecture and public exposure to systemic risk. The underlying drivers include advances in transactions and information technologies, regulatory changes, geographic shifts in growth opportunities, and the rapid evolution of client requirements, which in combination have obliged financial firms to rethink their roles as intermediaries. Moreover, financial sector reconfiguration has accelerated as a result of the global market turbulence that began in 2007, with governments either forcing or encouraging combinations of stronger and weaker financial firms in an effort to stem the crisis and improve systemic robustness. In the process, financial firms that are ""systemic"" in nature and had a major role in creating the crisis have come out of it with even larger market shares and greater systemic importance. Given the episodic socialization of risk in the form of widespread use of public guarantees to firms judged too big or too interconnected to be allowed to fail, the role of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) is central to the financial architecture and the public interest going forward. This survey paper considers the sources of systemic gains, losses and risks associated with SIFIs in historical context, in the theoretical and empirical literature, and in public policy discussions-i.e., what is gained and what is lost as a result of the available policy options to deal the dominant role of SIFIs in the financial architecture2011 Swiss Society for Financial Market Research.",2012,2012-01-01,19,Financial Markets and Portfolio Management,banking; financial architecture regulation; financial institutions; financial services; systemic risk,"Saunders, A.

"Orlowski, L.T.",Financial crisis and extreme market risks: evidence from europe,"This study draws attention to the proliferation of extreme risks in financial markets prior to and during the course of the recent global financial crisis. It examines the level of such ""tail"" risks in selected equity, interbank lending and foreign exchange markets in selected EU Member States in relation to the United States. The extent of tail risks is assessed by applying general error distribution (GED) parameterization in GARCH volatility tests of the examined variables. The empirical tests prove that extreme market risks were pronounced across all of the examined European financial markets throughout the crisis. They were also significant prior to the crisis outbreak. The analyzed interbank lending markets exhibited more extreme volatility outbursts than the equity and foreign exchange markets did. 2012 Elsevier Inc.",2012,2012-01-01,27,Review of Financial Economics,eu member states; financial crisis; systemic risk; tail risk,"Orlowski, L.T.

"Choi, Y.; Douady, R.",Financial crisis dynamics: attempt to define a market instability indicator,"The impact of increasing leverage in the economy produces hyperreaction of market participants to variations of their revenues. If the income of banks decreases, they mass-reduce their lendings if corporations sales drop, and they cannot adjust their liquidities by further borrowing due to existing debt, then they must immediately reduce their expenses, lay off staff, and cancel investments. This hyperreaction produces a bifurcation mechanism, and eventually a strong dynamical instability in capital markets that is commonly called systemic risk. In this article, we show that this instability can be monitored by measuring the highest eigenvalue of a matrix of elasticities. These elasticities measure the reaction of each sector of the economy to a drop in its revenues from another sector. This highest eigenvalue-the spectral radius-of the elasticity matrix can be used as an early indicator of market instability and potential crisis. Grandmont and subsequent research showed the possibility that the 'invisible hand' of markets becomes chaotic, opening the door to uncontrolled swings. Our contribution is to provide an actual way of measuring how close to chaos the market is. Estimating elasticities and actually generating the indicators of instability will be the topic of forthcoming research. 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2012,2012-01-01,21,Quantitative Finance,bifurcation; chaos theory; contagion; dynamical systems; econophysics; macroeconomics; systemic risk,"Choi, Y.

"Vieira, F.A.C.; Holland, M.; Resende, M.F.",Financial dollarization and systemic risks: new empirical evidence,"This paper explores the persistence of financial dollarization in a group of 79 economies with different levels of development. Our main hypothesis is that a high level of domestic debt combined with default risk explains this persistence, even after a decline in inflation rates. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) in a panel data analysis, our show that inflation risks caused by increasing probability of default account for financial dollarization more than inflation rate itself. After the decrease in inflation rates, the foreign currency-denominated deposits remain large because of the high debt-to-GDP ratios, particularly in speculative-grade economies. High public indebtedness leads to expectations of default. Dollarization is a rational response to the future inflation associated with investors' expectations of default observed in highly indebted economies. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,2012-01-01,15,Journal of International Money and Finance,financial dollarization; risk of default; risk of inflation,"Vieira, F.A.C.

"Baroni, M.",Financial markets: A tool for transferring and managing risk,"The last financial crisis showed that the world economy is globally exposed to all kinds of risks. When equity and real estate markets capture the creation of global wealth, derivatives markets make it possible to value and transfer risk. Hedging and speculation are the main motivations of the participants who buy and sell the numerous products traded in these markets. Following Robert Shiller’s writings, this chapter aims to show that these markets, whether organized or not, may provide new ways to manage most of the risks both firms and individuals are facing. However, at the same time, huge risk transfers may foster speculation and lead to new systemic risks, as revealed by the credit derivatives market in recent years. This paper considers how the financial markets can better serve people (individuals, long investors, funds) in the context of the current economic situation. Firstly, the paper characterizes the risks individuals are facing and to what extent they can be measured and hedged through the financial markets. Then, examples of risk transfer are shown using the example of the real estate market. The role of information required to construct relevant indices that can be used as underlying assets is also highlighted. Finally, the unwanted effects of risk transfer are considered, especially the role of speculation and the possible increase of systemic risk. The underline the importance of the quality of information that should be at the heart of new rules designed to regulate the development of derivative products. 2012, Springer Netherlands.",2012,2012-01-01,0,Ethical Economy,credit default swap; financial market; future market; real estate; systematic risk,"Baroni, M.

Notably, we consider the effect of heterogeneous degree distributions, heterogeneous balance sheet size and degree correlations between banks. We study the probability of contagion conditional on the failure of a random bank, the most connected bank and the biggest bank, and we consider the effect of targeted policies aimed at increasing the capital requirements of a few banks with high connectivity or big balance sheets. Networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are shown to be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank, but more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly connected nodes. A power law distribution of balance sheet size is shown to induce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to contagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the biggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of high average degree. Finally, disassortative mixing, such as that observed in real banking networks, is shown to enhance the stability of the system. 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",2012,2012-01-01,79,Advances in Complex Systems,contagion; network models; systemic risk,"Caccioli, F.

"Cebulak, P.",Inherent risks of the pluralist structure: use of the concept of national constitutional identity by the polish and czech constitutional courts,"The jurisprudence of the ECJ and national constitutional courts related to the national constitutional identities of the Members States fi ts into the framework of constitutional pluralism as a modus vivendi of the European legal order. This paper focuses in particular on the recent judgments of the Polish and Czech constitutional courts. One might perceive a general tendency in the process of EU integration for EU policies to be increasingly dominated by national agendas. As a result, EU policies might be held hostage by the interests of the stronger Member States. These tendencies increase the tensions inherent in the pluralist structure of the relationships between legal orders in the European arena. Constitutional identity is yet another concept used in this debate about ultimate authority. Pluralism assumes that the courts will compete over ultimate authority and will try to use such a concept 'to their advantage'. With regard to article(2) TEU, the ECJ seems to have more persuasive power than the Polish and the Czech constitutional courts. However, the jurisprudence is certainly not settled yet. The interweaving of national, European and international law creates the need to examine constitutional identity expressed inside and outside the EU. Pure heterarchy based on a balance of powers and protection of national constitutions as well as constitutional courts comes with the inherent risk of leading to the logic of 'might is right'. On the other hand, even though one could identify cases where the judicial actors seem to miss an opportunity to improve the protection of individual rights or where they reveal a troubling eagerness to ensure their own authority, such risks are an idiosyncrasy of the system of constitutional pluralism. The theory of constitutional pluralism has the ambition of improving the quality of judgments and creating a framework for fruitful interaction of competing visions of Europe. Single judgments that may be open to criticism do not bring into question the viability of the whole framework, but it is nonetheless important to be aware of the systemic risks.",2012,2012-01-01,1,Croatian Yearbook of European Law and Policy,,"Cebulak, P.

"O'Hara, P.A.","Institutional regimes, long wave systemic risk and great international crisis of 2008-2012","This paper studies the relationship between long-term growth of GDP per capita, institutional regimes of accumulation (ROA), systemic risk and the Great International Crisis of 2008-2010. The principle hypothesis behind the work is that the ROA provides a foundation for long-term growth as a type of fundamental variable, and that this growth provides a buffer against systemic risk in the sense that sustainable growth provides resources for debt provision and employment stimulation. The emergence of a viable ROA is crucial for long waves of growth which stimulate both private sector profit and public sector tax receipts which (using conventional terminology) reduce the structural deficit for both sectors. Low rates of long-term growth, therefore, provide a good indicator of the emergence of ""long wave systemic risk"" (LWSR), which left such nations vulnerable to uncertainty, financial crisis and recession. The paper investigates the inability of growth for various decades to ""cover"" instabilities associated with the Great Crisis, leading to high rates of LWSR, especially for European and North American nations that bore the brunt of the crisis.",2012,2012-01-01,7,Panoeconomicus,great international crisis; institutional regimes; long wave systemic risk,"O'Hara, P.A.

"Carpenter, D.H.",Lehman brothers and indymac: comparing resolution regimes,"In the United States, the insolvencies of depository institutions are not handled according to the procedures of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, they and their subsidiaries are subject to a separate regime prescribed in federal law, called a conservatorship or receivership. Under this regime, the conservator or receiver, which generally is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is provided substantial authority to deal with virtually every aspect of the insolvency. The failure of most other financial institutions within bank, thrift, and financial holding company umbrellas (including the holding companies themselves) generally are dealt with under the Bankruptcy Code. Two clear lessons of the 2008 recession are that no financial institution, regardless of its size, complexity, or diversification, is invincible, and the failure of large or highly interconnected financial firms can negatively impact other companies and the financial system as a whole. Congress, as a result, is left with the question of how best to handle the failure of these so-called ""systemically significant financial companies"" (SSFCs). Some have proposed legislation that would impose a conservatorship receivership regime, much like that for depository institutions, on insolvent financial institutions that are deemed systemically significant. Others have proposed resolving these institutions through a new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. In order to make a policy assessment concerning the appropriateness and likely effectiveness of these proposals, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences between insured depositories and other financial institutions large enough or interconnected enough to pose systemic risk to the U.S. economy upon failure, as well as the differences between the Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC's conservatorship receivership authority. To address these questions, other CRS reports analyze the FDIC's conservatorship and receivership powers over failed banks and thrifts and compare the FDIC's resolution regime with the Bankruptcy Code. This report seeks to build on those reports by examining the specific failures of two large financial institutions: IndyMac Bancorp, Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI). It should be noted that the resolutions of these two companies and their subsidiaries hadn't been completed at the time this report was written. At times, there are gaps in the information provided in this report, either as a result of the dearth of information publicly available or the opaqueness of that which is available. For example, Tablein this report generally does not include information regarding the primary business activities of LBHI's foreign subsidiaries, but certain foreign subsidiaries were included in the table to provide some perspective as to the breadth of LBHI's global reach, as well as in the financial services its subsidiaries provided. While this report is not an exhaustive analysis of the resolution of these two companies, in conjunction with our other reports, it does attempt to enhance the debate regarding how to structure the insolvency regimes for financial institutions. 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The liquidity-adjusted conditional three-moment CAPM shows that a security's conditional expected excess return depends on its conditional expected liquidity cost, the conditional covariance between its return and the market return, the conditional covariance between its liquidity cost and the market liquidity cost, and the conditional coskewness of its return and the market return. 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2012,2012-01-01,6,Economic Modelling,capm; conditional coskewness; liquidity; liquidity risk,"Wang, J.

"Suh, S.",Measuring systemic risk: A factor-augmented correlated default approach,"In this paper, we extend existing correlated default models for measuring systemic risk by proposing a model that incorporates an observable common factor that features conditional heteroscedasticity. The addition of the common factor helps to effectively capture realistic time-varying characteristics in individual asset return volatility as well as return correlations. We apply the model for large US financial institutions. The common factor proves its importance in explaining asset return dynamics and measuring systemic risk. We also apply the model in the context of systemic risk contribution analysis and show its applicability. 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2012,2012-01-01,11,Journal of Financial Intermediation,correlated default approach; financial stability; systemic risk; systemic risk contribution,"Suh, S.

"Starr, K.",Problematizing 'Risk' and the principalship: the risky business of managing risk in schools,"Over the past two decades, risk in education has stimulated increasing attention and prominence, with principals bearing responsibility and liability for 'managing' risk in schools. As a consequence, compulsory risk compliancegimes have become increasingly complex, technical and time-consuming. This article focuses on the responses of principals to issues surrounding 'risk' and suggests that some risk processes themselves may be inherently risky. Principals fear that risk managementgimes can incur professional and personal danger while ignoring some commonly known, politically sensitive, 'risky' areas. The article considers the scope of risk in schools before turning to 'undiscussables': how risk management puts principals at risk, and issues surrounding leaders as risk. Principals' concerns about marginalization from systemic risk decision-making, the individuation of risk management responsibility and suggestions for action are discussed, along with areas for future research.

"Arinaminpathy, N.; Kapadia, S.; May, R.M.",Size and complexity in model financial systems,"The global financial crisis has precipitated an increasing appreciation of the need for a systemic perspective toward financial stability. For example: What role do large banks play in systemic risk How should capital adequacy standards recognize this role How is stability shaped by concentration and diversification in the financial system We explore these questions using a deliberately simplified, dynamic model of a banking system that combines three different channels for direct transmission of contagion from one bank to another: liquidity hoarding, asset price contagion, and the propagation of defaults via counterparty credit risk. Importantly, we also introduce a mechanism for capturing how swings in ""confidence"" in the system may contribute to instability. Our highlight that the importance of relatively large, well-connected banks in system stability scales more than proportionately with their size: the impact of their collapse arises not only from their connectivity, but also from their effect on confidence in the system. Imposing tougher capital requirements on larger banks than smaller ones can thus enhance the resilience of the system. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in more concentrated systems, and continue to apply, even when allowing for potential diversification benefits that may be realized by larger banks.

"Srivastava, R.",Social protection for workers in india: struggling for basic rights under increasing labour market flexibility,"The issue of social protection has acquired relevance in the context of shocks and systemic risks that are being faced by the working poor in the context of globalisation. The paper shows that though the Indian workforce is largely informal, there are indications of further flexibilisation of employment relations, leading to greater mobility and informalisation. In the recent past, the Indian State has conceded some space to rights-based social protection measures. This has led to an increased financial allocation by the Central Government to areas of social protection which have come within the ambit of rights. However, the paper shows that the relative importance of these measures for the population as a whole, in terms of their financing by the Centre and the states taken together, has been much less remarkable. On minimum conditions of work and rights at work, the paper notes that there has been very little progress in recent years. While examining the major social security programmes, including social security programmes emerging out of the NCEUS proposals, the paper again finds an increase in recent years, particularly in the programmes for employment creation and food security. However, the total expenditure on protective social security remains small. The paper also examines the earlier NCEUS proposals on social security and suggests a modified package for reconsideration. It may be mentioned that currently the National Advisory Council (NAC) to the Government is considering fresh proposals for universal protective social security. Hence, it is important to re-examine the NCEUS proposals and the Government schemes in this context. 2012, Springer India.

"Mayes, D.G.",Some rules for cross-border banks in europe,"Professor David Mayes examines the balance between principles and rules in the context of European banking regulation and argues that EU member state regulators have yet to strike a balance between the use of a common rule-book and common principles for the prudential oversight of EU banks with cross-border operations. Although the chapter was written largely before the adoption of EU bank regulatory reforms in 2011, its main critique that EU bank regulation fails to provide an adequate balance between a common rule-book and common principles remains steadfast, especially in light of the lack of a structured early intervention regime for EU-based banking groups that operate on a cross-border basis. These banking organisations often pose systemic risks across EU jurisdictions and also have depositors in many European states. In addressing these risks, Mayes suggests that a common rule book with trigger points for supervisory intervention may be more eff ective for overseeing cross-border banking groups than primary reliance on common principles of action. While the chapter recognises that both common rules and common principles are important, a common rule book for structured early supervisory intervention is more appropriate for coordinating eff ective oversight of the cross-border operations of European banking groups. For PCA to work on a cross-border basis in Europe, however, it may be necessary to have further institutional consolidation at the European level to improve the oversight of European banks that operate in more than one jurisdiction or which pose systemic risk in more than one EEA state.

Though this ""maturity transformation"" is a useful and productive function of banks, it gives rise to the possibility that even prudently managed banks could fail due to a lack of liquid assets. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 revealed the extent to which the U.S. financial system is exposed to the risk of a system-wide failure from insufficient liquidity. Financial regulators from economies around the world have responded to the crisis by proposing new, internationally uniform bank liquidity standards, augmenting the existing Basel Capital Accord.

"Cliff, D.; Northrop, L.",The global financial markets: an ultra-large-scale systems perspective,"We argue here that, in recent years, the world's financial markets have become a globally interconnected complex adaptive ultra-large-scale socio-technical system-of-systems, and that this has important consequences for how the financial markets should be engineered and managed in future. Major failures in the financial markets can now occur at super-human speeds, as was witnessed in the ""Flash Crash"" of Mayth 2010. Events such as the Flash Crash may become more commonplace in future, unless lessons are learned from other fields where complex adaptive socio-technical systems-of-systems have to be engineered for high-integrity, safety-critical applications. In this document we review the literature on failures in risky technology and high-integrity approaches to safety-critical SoS engineering. We conclude with an argument that, in the specific case of the global financial markets, there is an urgent need to develop major national strategic modeling and predictive simulation capabilities, comparable to national-scale meteorological monitoring and modeling capabilities. The intent here is not to predict the price-movements of particular financial instruments or asset classes, but rather to provide test-rigs for principled evaluation of systemic risk, estimating probability density functions over spaces of possible outcomes, and thereby identifying potentially high-consequence failure modes in the simulations, before they occur in real life, by which time it is typically too late. 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2012,2012-01-01,13,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),algorithmic trading; commerce; finance; financial market; financial markets; flash crash; high frequency hf; high-frequency trading; information technology; it system; large scale systems; large-scale complex it systems; normalization of deviance; probability density function; risk perception; safety engineering; ultra-large-scale systems,"Cliff, D.

This forward looking measure is model-independent and based on observed option data. It is baptized the Herd Behavior Index (HIX).The degree of co-movement in a stock market can be determined by comparing the observed market situation with the extreme (theoretical) situation under which the whole system is driven by a single factor. The HIX is then defined as the ratio of an option-based estimate of the risk-neutral variance of the market index and an option-based estimate of the corresponding variance in case of the extreme single factor market situation. The HIX can be determined for any market index provided an appropriate series of vanilla options is traded on this index as well as on its components.

This has lead to the emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users.

"Huhtinen, A.-M.","What does the concept of ""ambidexterity"" mean in the current military planning process","How do organizations survive in the face of change This is a key question for Western military organizations after the Iraq War and its consequences. All human crises are manmade because of we are human beings. The spreading of individual risk also increases systemic risk. The root cause of the problem is what has been termed ""rational irrationality""behavior that, on the individual level, is perfectly reasonable but that, when aggregated in a complex system, produces calamity (Alpaslan Mitroff 2010, xvii). From the perspective of organizational adaptation and learning, March (1991) argues that a significant number of competencies needs to be learnt and unlearnt during each and every process of change. According to Birkinshaw and Gibson (2011, 2004), in many sports, ambidexterity is a competitive advantage. Footballers are encouraged to use both left and right foot left-handed batsmen have a slight advantage against right handed bowlers the southpaw boxer presents a rarely encountered challenge to a boxer with an orthodox stance some ambidextrous tennis players even use both hands, separately, to play strokes during a rally. And while some individuals are naturally twohanded or two-footed, many work hard to gain an advantage by practising until they master ambidexterity. The challenge for public security and safety organizations is that with terrorism and changes brought on by cybersecurity they are faced with their greatest challenge since the end of World War Two. Not only are the structures and operating procedures undergoing change but also attitudes and values are pressed on by a changing society. Rational black and white thinking no longer functions when immigrants, various ethnic s, social media and the operating mechanisms and values of market economy force their way into the training grounds of military bases and battlefields.

"Acharya, V.V.; Kulkarni, N.",What saved the indian banking system: state ownership or state guarantees,"The global financial crisis which began in the fall of 2007 and progressively worsened in 2008, affected the Indian financial sector beginning only in 2008. While Indian financial firms have been fairly resilient compared with their global counterparts, we show that Indian private sector firms faced greater losses compared with public sector firms during the crisis period of 2008-09. We use a stock market-based measure of systemic risk, marginal expected shortfall (MES), to determine the systemic risk contributed by each Indian financial firm for the period preceding the crisis (January-December 2007) and compare it to its realised returns during the crisis (January 2008-February 2009). Our show that public sector firms outperformed private sector firms despite having greater systemic risk during the crisis. We conclude that investors rewarded Indian public sector firms with greater systemic risk while penalising private sector firms with similar risk. We attribute this finding to the explicit and implicit government backing of public sector banks. We find that riskier public sector banks with high ex ante systemic risk and low Tiercapital received greater capital support from the government. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2012,2012-01-01,23,World Economy,banking; capital; financial crisis; financial system; india; risk assessment; state owned enterprise; stock market,"Acharya, V.V.

"Carapeto, M.; Acosta, M.",Why protect financial markets,"The purpose of this paper is to estimate the benefits from adopting close-out netting to decrease the exposure to counterparty risk across the world markets and to establish the additional benefits from central counterparties towards decreasing counterparty risk. The novelty of the approach is to estimate a figure for counterparty credit risk (CCR) grouping together most of the financial transactions that generate counterparty risk and to analyze the benefit of netting possibilities in reducing the overall risk exposure, using three different scenarios. In the first scenario, counterparty credit risk is calculated assuming that no close-out netting is possible across different contracts. The second scenario assumes bilateral negotiations and netting across contracts. The third scenario contemplates the existence of a central counterparty as the center of transactions. Benefits from netting and central counterparty are assessed by comparing the risk exposure in each scenario. from the model show that netting provides a decrease in world counterparty risk of over $17 trillion. Netting is thus a powerful tool available in the world markets to manage counterparty risk while decreasing systemic risk, and as such policies to facilitate and standardize netting procedures across different jurisdictions should be encouraged. Moreover, show that the use of central counterparties for settling the outstanding contracts would additionally decrease CCR by over $2 trillion. 2012, Virtus Interpress.

"De, F.L.G.; Phelps, S.",An investigation of the consequences of basel III using an agent-based model,"Many recent agent-based models of financial markets are singleasset models which do not consider risk-management strategies in which agents can invest in both riskless and risky assets. This makes them unsuitable for exploring the implications of regulatory proposals such as Basel III which require agents to balance their exposure to risk by maintaining a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. In this paper, we will introduce an agent-based model of a financial market in which agents can invest in both risky and riskless assets. We will first validate our model against the empirically-observed stylized facts of financial time-series data and then we proceed to investigate the counterfactual implications of the Basel III proposals for systemic risk. We will also use our model to make testable predictions about the consequences of Basel III which we shall revisit if and when the regulation is implemented.

"Pons, M.; Cousins, S.W.; Alcazar, O.; Striker, G.E.; Marin-Castaño, M.E.",Angiotensin II-induced MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and basigin protein expression are mediated via the angiotensin ii receptor type 1-mitogen-activated protein kinasepathway in retinal pigment epithelium: implications for age-related macular degeneration,"Accumulation of various lipid-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) deposits under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). RPE-derived matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-14, and basigin (BSG) are major enzymes involved in the maintenance of ECM turnover. Hypertension (HTN) is a systemic risk factor for AMD. It has previously been reported that angiotensin II (Ang II), one of the most important hormones associated with HTN, increases MMP-2 activity and its key regulator, MMP-14, in RPE, inducing breakdown of the RPE basement membrane, which may lead to progression of sub-RPE deposits. Ang II exerts most of its actions by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Herein is explored the MAPK signaling pathway as a potential key intracellular modulator of Ang II-induced increase in MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and BSG protein expression. It was observed that Ang II stimulates phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK in RPE cells and ERK p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in mice. These effects were mediated by Ang II typereceptors. Blockade of ERK or p38 MAPK abrogated the increase in MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and BSG proteins in ARPE-19 cells. A better understanding of the molecular events by which Ang II induces ECM dysregulation is of critical importance to further define its contribution to the progression of sub-RPE deposits in AMD patients with HTN.

"Schwerter, S.",Basel III's ability to mitigate systemic risk,"Purpose The financial crisis 2007-2009 calls for a regulatory response. A crucial element of this task is the treatment of systemic risk. Basel III gains centre stage in this process. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate Basel III, examining its ability to reduce systemic risk. Design methodology approach The paper highlights the importance of reducing systemic risk to achieve the goal of overall financial stability. By first focusing on the theoretical foundations of systemic risk, this paper explores and analyzes the crucial aspects of this almost impalpable risk type. It further investigates the current regulation of systemic risk, clearly showing Basel II's inability to reduce it. Then, it evaluates the Basel Committee's efforts to address these weaknesses through Basel III by investigating its incentives and its ability to reduce obvious drawbacks of Basel II as well as systemic risk factors. Findings The findings show that there are still adjustments necessary. Although the development of Basel III is well advanced, providing some stabilizing incentives, there are still issues calling for closer consideration to counter all Basel II drawbacks and systemic risk factors adequately. These include: a risk-weighted leverage ratio a more thorough treatment of procyclicality adjustments for the NSFR (Net Stable Funding ratio) and most importantly, the mandatory issue to internalize negative externalities from financial institutions, that is, the call for pricing systemic risk. Originality value The paper not only examines the new Basel III framework, as a response to the Financial Crisis 2007-2009, but also draws attention to specific areas which the Basel Committee and regulators need to focus on more thoroughly. 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2011,2011-01-01,18,Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance,basel iii; financial regulation; financial stability; international finance; macroprudential regulation; risk management; systemic risk,"Schwerter, S.

"Crawford, C.A.",Can humanitarian responses in urban areas reinforce underlying causes of vulnerability tweaking a livelihoods analysis of inequality and infrastructure in splintering cities,"International humanitarian agencies are often mandated to target the most vulnerable. This, combined with short funding cycles, encourages extractive assessments of individualized vulnerability responses based on delivering individual packages of household assets and only superficial consideration of power relationships. By analogy with urban infrastructure provision, this paper argues that narrow interpretation of the sustainable livelihoods framework applied to urban analysis gives only limited insights into the systemic risks faced by urban dwellers. Using an analysis of infrastructure that draws on the idea of splintering urbanism, a process by which urban infrastructure tends to privilege some and bypass others, the paper develops a visual framework for considering the interdependence of urban livelihoods, physical infrastructure and the organizing tendencies of powerful service providers. The paper concludes that in the cases where it is not possible to identify the most vulnerable (e.g. in dense, heterogeneous cities) or where it is possible only to identify the most vulnerable but not to deliver asset packages to them (e.g. transitional shelter kits that cannot be received by people without access to a plot), humanitarian activities risk reinforcing the systemic, underlying causes of vulnerability. 2011 Taylor Francis.",2011,2011-01-01,6,Environmental Hazards,humanitarian aid; infrastructural development; infrastructure; international aid; megacity; resilience; risk reduction; sustainable development; urban economy; urban livelihoods; urbanization; vulnerability,"Crawford, C.A.

"Rossi, S.",Can it happen againstructural policies to avert further systemic crises,"elaborate on the structural causes of the global systemic crisis of 2007-9 to show that its ultimate origins lie in the still defective bookkeeping structure of national and international payment systems. As monetary circuit theory shows, banks are special, insofar as they can grant loans without the need to dispose of preexistent bank deposits. When the loans-generate-deposits causal chain occurs on the factor market, for firms to pay the wage bill, the money-output relation is not affected by banks' intermediation. This relation is modified when banks exploit the loans-generate-deposits mechanism for any financial market transactions, whether for their clients or for their own sake. Financial liberalization and deregulation pushed banks to compete with nonbank financial institutions, for them to retain their market share, reducing both their markup on monetary policy rates of interest and the credit standard they used to apply to firms as well as households. In that process, banks have, therefore, become ""financial supermarkets,"" engaged first and foremost in investment banking, which is a misnomer, because, in fact, it has nothing to do with investment properly speaking: it is speculation on ""global"" financial markets, which are indeed far from providing any support to productive investment within the economic system. 2011, Copyright Taylor Francis Group, LLC.",2011,2011-01-01,7,International Journal of Political Economy,bank money; financial crisis; payment systems; systemic risk,"Rossi, S.

"Jickling, M.",Causes of a financial crisis,"The current financial crisis began in August 2007, when financial stability replaced inflation as the Federal Reserve's chief concern. The roots of the crisis go back much further, and there are various views on the fundamental causes. It is generally accepted that credit standards in U.S. mortgage lending were relaxed in the early 2000s, and that rising rates of delinquency and foreclosures delivered a sharp shock to a range of U.S. financial institutions. Beyond that point of agreement, however, there are many questions that will be debated by policymakers and academics for decades. Why did the financial shock from the housing market downturn prove so difficult to contain Why did the tools the Fed used successfully to limit damage to the financial system from previous shocks (the Asian crises of 1997-1998, the stock market crashes of 1987 and 2000-2001, the junk bond debacle in 1989, the savings and loan crisis,11, and so on) fail to work this time If we accept that the origins are in the United States, why were so many financial systems around the world swept up in the panic To what extent were long-term developments in financial markets to blame for the instability Derivatives markets, for example, were long described as a way to spread financial risk more efficiently, so that market participants could bear only those risks they understood. Did derivatives, and other risk management techniques, actually increase risk and instability under crisis conditions Was there too much reliance on computer models of market performance Did those models reflect only the post-WWII period, which may now come to be viewed not as a typical 60-year period, suitable for use as a baseline for financial forecasts, but rather as an unusually favorable period that may not recur Did government actions inadvertently create the conditions for crisis Did regulators fail to use their authority to prevent excessive risk-taking, or was their jurisdiction too limited and or compartmentalized The multiple roots of the crisis are mirrored in the policy response. Two bills in the 111th Congress-H.R. 4173, passed by the House on December 11, 2009, and Senator Dodd's Restoring American Financial Stability Act, as ordered reported by the Senate Banking Committee on March 22, 2010-address many of the purported causal factors across the entire financial system. The bills address systemic risk, too-big-to-fail, prudential supervision, hedge funds, derivatives, payments systems, credit rating agencies, securitization, and consumer financial protection. (For a summary of major provisions, see CRS Report R40975, Financial Regulatory Reform and the 111th Congress, coordinated by Baird Webel.)

"Kuroda, T.",Cellular kinetics of neuroblastoma and the role of surgery,"Neuroblastoma is known for its peculiar cellular kinetics, which has provoked some controversy regarding surgical treatment. Highly sensitive exploration systems using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods have been developed to detect neuroblastoma cells. In our series of 49 patients with advanced neuroblastoma, circulating tumor cells (CTC) were detected by this system in 55.6% of the stagepatients who were examined, suggesting that the primary lesion may release tumor cells into the peripheral blood. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was significantly lower among the patients with CTC or chemotherapy-insensitive bone marrow micrometastasis, compared with those without detectable micrometastasis (33.8 vs. 87.5%,0.05). In contrast, a stagepatient with MYCN amplification exhibited drastic local relapse without systemic dissemination of the disease. Two patients were positive for CTC without an identifiable primary site. These observations indicate that the local growth of the primary tumor and tumor cell dissemination may be regulated by different molecular mechanisms in neuroblastomas. MYCN amplification seemed to be more closely associated with localized tumor growth but was minimally correlated with CTC positivity. High-risk neuroblastoma may include two separate subgroups characterized by different cellular kinetics: a local risk cohort and a systemic risk cohort. Surgical strategies for neuroblastoma should be determined with taking this cellular kinetics into consideration. 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2011,2011-01-01,3,Pediatric Surgery International,bone marrow metastasis; cancer localization; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cell kinetics; cellular kinetics; child; circulating tumor cell; clinical article; controlled study; high risk patient; human; human cell; humans; micrometastasis; molecular mechanics; neoplasm micrometastasis; neuroblastoma; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; review; surgery; survival rate; tumor cell; tumor growth,"Kuroda, T.

"Welty, N.; Rudolph, M.; Schäfer, F.; Apeldoorn, J.; Janovsky, R.",Computational methodology to predict satellite system-level effects from impacts of untrackable space debris,"The unconstrained growth in space debris poses an increasing systemic risk to space operations. To support space debris risk assessments, probabilistic models have been developed to estimate incident fluxes of smaller debris particles (typically less than 10 cm) which currently cannot be tracked by space surveillance networks. Using a debris flux model and an appropriate ballistic limit equation (BLE), the risk of penetration of the spacecraft wall from debris impacts can be calculated, as is currently done to satisfy safety requirements for manned space missions. However, for unmanned missions, penetration of the spacecraft wall is not necessarily critical and may be an overly conservative indicator of mission risk. For an optimized satellite design, the influence of debris impacts on the functionality of components and the overall system needs to be evaluated. This paper proposes a computational methodology to predict the satellite system-level effects resulting from impacts of untrackable space debris particles. This approach seeks to improve on current risk assessment practices by assessing the physical damage to internal components from debris impacts and correlating these effects to system functional impairment. The proposed method combines a debris flux model with the Sch fer-Ryan-Lambert BLE, which accounts for the inherent shielding of components behind the spacecraft structure wall. Debris impact trajectories and component shadowing effects are considered. The failure probabilities of individual satellite components as a function of mission time are calculated. These are correlated to expected functional impairment using a Boolean logic model of the system functional architecture to account for functional dependencies and redundancies within the system.

"Dardanelli, G.T.",Direct or indirect regulation of hedge funds: A european dilemma,"This paper deals with the debate on the methods to regulate hedge funds, with a particular focus on direct or indirect regulation. After having briefly examined the pros and the cons of directly regulating these investment schemes, it comes to the conclusion (largely shared by most scholars) that hedge funds should not be directly regulated, while regulation should concern their management companies and, most of all, their counterparts (lenders in the first place) with a view to managing systemic risk. In addition, regulation should also set precise thresholds for access which should aim at protecting unsophisticated investors from hazardous moves, without, however, falling into the trap of regulating hedge fund themselves. The attention is then turned to the European Union and to its Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). An analysis is conducted on some of the most significant approaches to hedge fund regulation which have fuelled (and are partly still fuelling) the debate within EU institutions in its struggle to provide Member States with a valid response to the financial crisis, and on some key provisions of the first level AIFMD. In this light the author concludes that, despite the declared intent to regulated fund managers, the directive often seems to regulate hedge fund themselves. This does not seem to be in line with the thoughts of most scholars and market operators on hedge fund regulation and also looks at odds with other pieces of EU legislation (in particular with the so-called ""Newcits"").",2011,2011-01-01,2,European Journal of Risk Regulation,,"Dardanelli, G.T.

"Levitin, A.J.",In defense of bailouts,"Systemic risk-the possibility that an individual firm's failure will result in broad damages to the economy as a whole-is the epitome of financial crisis. Systemic risk is best addressed ex ante, but no regulatory regime can credibly eliminate systemic risk, so ex post crisis response is unavoidable. Bailouts of troubled firms have long been the standard ex post response to systemic risk. Yet, bailouts suffer from problems of political legitimacy. Bankruptcy is often presented as a more legitimate alternative to bailouts because its loss allocation system is preset and determined in the abstract. This Article argues that the choice between bailouts and bankruptcy is illusory. Bailouts and bankruptcy are not alternative choices but an integrated system any preset resolution system will be abandoned for a bailout if it would produce socially unacceptable loss allocations. Therefore, bailouts' political legitimacy is critical. Accordingly, the Article proposes a framework for analyzing bailouts' legitimacy by turning to the institutional design of bailouts. It identifies and explores two fundamental questions involved in all bailouts. First, should bailouts be done ad hoc through Congress or should bailout authority be institutionalized in an agency And second, should creditors of bailed-out firms be forced to accept less than full payment (or take a ""haircut"") as part of the bailout Ensuring accountability and fairness in resolving these issues is essential for bailouts' political legitimacy and ultimate efficacy. 2011.",2011,2011-01-01,68,Georgetown Law Journal,,"Levitin, A.J.

"Ye, K.; Yan, J.; Wang, S.; Wang, H.; Miao, B.",Knowledge level modeling for systemic risk management in financial institutions,"The current subprime mortgage crisis is a typical case for systemic risk in financial institutions. In order to further our understanding and communication about systemic risk management (SRM) in financial institutions, this paper proposes a knowledge level model (KLM) for systemic risk management in financial institutions. There are two parts considered in the proposed KLM: ontologies and problem solving method (PSM). Ontologies are adopted to represent a knowledge base of KLM, which integrates top level ontology and domain level ontologies. And then the problem solving method is given to show the reasoning process of this knowledge. The symbol level of KLM is also discussed which integrates OWL, SWRL and JESS. Further, the discussion about Lehman Brother's Minibonds case in 2008 is provided to illustrate how proposed KLM is used in practice. With these, first, they will enhance the interchange of information and knowledge sharing for SRM within a financial institution. Second, they will assist knowledge base development for SRM design, for which a prototype of financial systemic risk management decision support system is given in this study. Third, they will support coordination among different institutions by using standardized vocabularies. And finally, from the design science perspective, the whole proposed framework could be meaningful to models in other domains. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Ajoy, M.V.; Nithyanandam, S.; Idiculla, J.",Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin as risk factors for the occurrence and increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy,"Aim: To assess the influence of urinary microalbuminuria and hemoglobin concentration on the occurrence and severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR), clinically significant macular edema (CSME) and hard exudate formation. Materials and Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study carried out over a period ofyears, typediabetic patients seeking ocular evaluation for DR were assessed for presence and severity of DR, presence of hard exudates and CSME. Retinal findings were correlated to severity of microalbuminuria, hemoglobin concentration and other systemic risk factors using linear regression analysis.Three hundred and six patients were included in the study. DR of any grade was seen in 132 (43%) patients, hard exudate formation in 93 306 (30.4%) patients, CSME in 50 306 (16.3%) patients and proliferative DR in 26 306 (8.5%) patients. Duration of diabetes (P 0.001), microalbuminuria (P 0.001) and low hemoglobin (P 0.001) were found to be highly significant risk factors for the development and increasing severity of DR as well as for CSME and hard exudate formation. Conclusion: Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin are strong predictors for DR, CSME and hard exudate formation in typediabetics even after correcting for duration of diabetes and other systemic risk factors. Although not directly involved in the pathogenesis, microalbuminuria can help in identifying patients at risk for more severe diabetic eye disease. Microalbuminuria warrants intensive monitoring of both retinal and renal status. The hemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly in diabetic patients to detect and treat anemia, thereby reducing one risk factor for DR.",2011,2011-01-01,37,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,"adult; aged; aged, 80 and over; albuminuria; anemia; article; blood; cross-sectional studies; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus, type 2; diabetic retinopathy; exudate; exudates and transudates; female; hemoglobin; hemoglobins; hospitalization; human; humans; linear models; macular edema; male; metabolism; microalbuminuria; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; prospective studies; prospective study; retina macula edema; risk factor; risk factors; severity; severity of illness index; statistical model","Ajoy Mohan, V.

"Van, A.M.B.A.; Renn, O.",Risk governance,"The term 'governance' has been used in political science to describe the multitude of actors and processes that lead to collective binding decisions. The term 'risk governance' involves the translation of the substance and core principles of governance to the context of risk-related decision-making. Does it involve a major change on how risks are conceptualized, managed, and communicated, or it is just a new fashion In this paper, we aim to delineate the genesis and analytical scope of risk governance. In our view, risk governance pertains to the various ways in which many actors, individuals, and institutions, public and private, deal with risks surrounded by uncertainty, complexity, and or ambiguity. It emphasizes that not all risks are simple they cannot be calculated as a function of probability and effect. It is more than a descriptive shorthand for a complex, interacting network in which collective binding decisions are taken around a particular set of societal issues. The ambition is that risk governance provides a conceptual as well as normative basis for how to deal responsibly with uncertain, complex, and or ambiguous risks in particular. We propose to synthesize the body of scholarly ideas and proposals on the governance of systemic risks in a set of principles: the communication and inclusion principle, the integration principle, and the reflection principle. This set of principles should be read as a synthesis of what needs to be seriously considered in organizing structures and processes to govern risks. 2011 Taylor Francis.",2011,2011-01-01,323,Journal of Risk Research,ambiguity; complexity; decision making; paradigm shift; public risks; risk governance; uncertainty,"Van Asselt, M.B.A. (Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands); Renn, O.

"Gál, B.","Surgical therapy of nasal polyposis part i: prognostic importance of allergy, bronchial asthma a ASA sensitivity Chirurgick cba nosn polyp zyst: prognostick znam alergie, astma bronchiale a ASA senzitivity","We present a study group of 94 patients operated on for bilateral nasal polyposis refractory to medical treatment in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of St. Anne's University Hospital Brno between 1998 and 2005. In order to ensure homogeneity of the group, patients operated on and followed-up by one surgeon were evaluated. The extent of NP was assessed using the preoperative radiological staging according to Lund-Mackay the median CT score was 16 points,0.25,0.75 (13.18). In 42 patients (45%) the value of radiological CT staging was higher than 16 points, which corresponds to the category of the diffuse NP. The surgery was performed in accordance with the principles of the functional endonasal surgery concept and the extent of the surgery was classified according to a surgical score. The average follow-up period was 73 (45-125) months. Determination of recurrence rate was an important criterion to evaluate the success of treatment. In the follow-up period, 24 (25.5%) recurrences were diagnosed. The median value of the recurrence-free interval was 39. months. For evaluation of the prognostic significance of systemic risk factors, the patients were divided intosubgroups. In the first subgroup which consisted of 29 patients without proved allergy, bronchial asthma or ASA sensitivity, no recurrence of NP was diagnosed during the follow-up period. The second subgroup consisted of patients with proved allergy without bronchial asthma and ASA sensitivity (n 15), recurrence rate was 20% (3). In the third subgroup there were patients with bronchial asthma without ASA sensitivity (n 30), recurrence rate was 27% (8). In the fourth group there were patients with ASA intolerance (n 20), recurrence rate was 65% (13). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of recurrenceyears after surgery in patients without risk factors was 0%, in allergy patients about 13%, in asthmatics about 17% and in patients with ASA sensitivity about 50%.

The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study is a national longitudinal study of more than 30,000 African American and white adults 45 years or older. Data for tooth loss, cognitive function and potential confounding variables were available for 9,853 participants at the time of analysis. The authors used incremental linear regression modeling to investigate the crosssectional association between self-reported tooth loss and cognitive function.In unadjusted analysis (mean learning followed by recall a level of significance of .05), the loss of six to 16 teeth and the loss of more than 16 teeth were associated with poorer cognitive function compared with the loss of no teeth. Attenuated associations persisted after the authors adjusted for demographic and systemic risk factors. The full model, which was adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES), revealed no association between tooth loss and cognitive function. Conclusion. Tooth loss may be associated with cognitive function however, this association is mediated by age and SES. Clinical Implications. Tooth loss due to periodontal disease may be a marker for low SES, and the interplay of these factors with advanced age may confer risk of having poorer cognitive function.

"Taub, J.S.",The sophisticated investor and the global financial crisis,"The financial instruments and risky practices that caused the global financial crisis of 2008 were enabled by decades of deregulation and anemic government enforcement efforts. The elements that combined to create the crisis were subprime mortgage securities, credit default swaps, highly leveraged hedge funds, and excessive short-term borrowing at investment banks.1 They flourished without government oversight, transparency, or limits because proponents contended that ""private ordering"" of financial markets, instead of government intervention, was ideal. The champions of private ordering contended government interference was inappropriate for sophisticated investors (SIs) who had the expertise and incentives to properly assess risk, and to select and monitor complex investment options. They believed that by acting in their own interests, SIs would keep the market safe and ensure the efficient allocation of capital to businesses and individuals who would make the most productive use of the money. Sophisticated investors include, for example, government, corporate, and union pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, endowments, brokerdealers, insurance firms, banks, and sovereign funds. They also include individuals who earn as little as $200,000 per year. While many experts warned about the dangerous consequences of deregulation,Congress and regulators accepted the conventional perspective that sophisticated market participants would police and avoid irrational conduct.3 The concept of the SI exception is embedded in our securities laws. It is a mechanism that allows securities issuers to sometimes bypass legal requirements intended to protect ordinary people who purchase securities (""retail investors""). The securities laws were designed, initially, to protect retail investors from confusing, worthless, or high-risk investments.4 In other words, ""Congress was concerned that the average investor was being fleeced in the financial markets by inadequate disclosure, misrepresentation, and manipulative schemes.""5 Thus, once an investor is deemed ""sophisticated,"" many investment options can be offered and sold without many protections.6 The demarcation between the ordinary and the sophisticated, as noted below, depends wholly upon wealth and not upon any measure of experience or skill. The SI concept spread to other financial laws and rules. And when new risky instruments emerged, the reliance upon a market filled with SIs was sufficient to convince lawmakers and regulators to remove barriers and allow for the expansion of these unregulated or very lightly regulated offerings. The SI exception may have been a valid carve-out to the early legal requirements from the 1930s. However, a few major changes make it no longer viable. First, unlike earlier securities offerings, financial instruments have grown far more complex than the capacity of computers to handle, let alone human brains. Some computer scientists and economists argue that ""even when buyers know all of the relevant information,"" it is nearly impossible to price even the simplest collateralized debt obligations7 and that it would take many days for a powerful computer to establish a price.8 As a result, mere humans, including most expert analysts, got lost in the complexity, fell prey to decision-making biases, and overlooked the absence of critical data points.9 In the debt and derivative markets, many of these tradable instruments did not exist in the 1930s, nor did they exist even prior to the 1980s or 1990s. Indeed, even those who constructed these instruments admitted difficulty pricing them. For example, a Goldman Sachs employee who helped build and sell such a structure posed this rhetorical question: ""Well, what if we created a 'thing,' which has no purpose, which is absolutely conceptual and highly theoretical and which nobody knows how to price ""10 Second, the incentive to maximize short-term personal welfare meant ""sophistication"" in forecasting and preventing the demise of one's firm and the financial system as a whole was subordinated to short-term profit seeking by senior executives and other employees. Thus, those who expected ""self-interest"" to prevail forgot the agency problemthat personal self-interest is not the same as the firm's or shareholders' self-interest. Third, a huge shift in ownership has occurred since the SI exemptions were conceived. In the early twentieth century, ""managerial capitalism""11 emerged, characterized by diffuse shareholders and powerful managersthe separation of ownership from control.12 However, by the end of the century, we experienced an intermediation revolution.13 In the 1970s, individuals held about 80 percent of U.S. corporate equities 14 however, currently, giant intermediary institutions hold legal title to approximately 70 percent. 15 Also, the vast majority of outstanding corporate and government bonds are held by institutions.16 While institutions may hold legal title to these investments, they are not the real investors who put their money at risk. Instead, they are often investing the capital of real people whose money is funneled to them through various other intermediaries. For example, in 2009, one class of institutional investor, the mutual fund, held 24 percent of U.S. equities.17 Institutional investors who make investment decisions without the benefit of proper protections do so on behalf of underlying or ""ultimate"" investors. These are pension fund beneficiaries, mutual fund shareholders, and other ordinary people who on their own behalf would not be considered sophisticated and thus could not directly make such purchases. Therefore, when a sophisticated institutional investor makes poor choices, this harms the ultimate investors, the people whom the securities laws were designed to protect. Former president Bill Clinton recently recognized this problem. He explained that the justification for the failure to regulate complex instruments was that: ""these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them and they don't need any extra protection, and any extra transparency And the flaw in that argument was that first of all sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make them without transparency And secondly, the most important flaw was even if less thanpercent of the total investment community is involved in these investments so much money was involved that if they went bad, they could affect 100 percent of the investments, and indeed 100 percent of the citizens in countries.""18 In other words, reliance upon the sophisticated investor ignores reality the entities the law deems to meet the definition are largely neither sophisticated enough to match the complexity of the instruments or lack of data nor the actual investors who have placed their capital at risk. Looking back on the global financial crisis, it is clear that reliance upon SIs was misguided. There are numerous examples of how SIs were not able to make good choices. And, these incidents were not on the fringes but central to the crisis. As more information emerges concerning the creation and sale of toxic securities, it is clear that reliance upon SIs provided the rationalization for sharp if not illegal practices. Firms like Goldman Sachs invoked the SI concept while defending against securities fraud allegations that it created and sold some sophisticated clients bonds that were designed to fail while allowing others who helped create the bonds to bet against them. In addition, lobbyists and legislators continue to rely upon the sophisticated investor framework to shield certain financial institutions and instruments from government oversight. In this fashion, the SI concept continues to be trumpeted by those who seek carve-outs from reform efforts. Despite the reliance on the SI concept, little attention has been paid to the importance of the SI failure. Accordingly, an examination of the incapacity of sophisticated investors to monitor unregulated investment options and of the role sophisticated investors play in creating systemic risk is a necessary prerequisite to restoring financial safety and economic stability.

This paper explores the production of medical isotopes in Canada as an illustration of complex issues requiring decision support. It proposes a four-feature strategy for policy makers. Tightly but inversely connected, risks generated by either the production or non-production of medical isotopes are multidimensional and located on both the demand (healthy citizens and their well-being) and supply (safety of production) sides. The decision making also involves multidisciplinary considerations. Another feature of the process is the geographic scale. Production goes beyond domestic needs as global society depends on medical isotopes and must rely on very few producers.

"Srivastava, N.; Srivastava, J.",A hybrid-logic approach towards fault detection in complex cyber-physical systems,"Existing data mining approaches to complex systems anomaly detection use uni-variate and or multi-variate statistical hypothesis testing to assign anomaly scores to data streams associated with system components. The former approach assumes statistical independence of individual components, while the latter assumes substantial global systemic correlation. As a compromise between these two epistemological extremes, we present a data-mining approach hybridizing existing statistical techniques with theorem-proving methods to create a novel algorithm for anomaly detection, diagnosis and control in complex systems. Our algorithm takes sensor inputs from physical sensors providing system subcomponent performance data and outputs (i) a global systemic risk indicator and (ii) possible diagnosis hypotheses. We present on three different systems, and in comparison with current state-of-the-art fault detection algorithms to demonstrate the viability of our approach. We find that our algorithm proves robust towards increased data dimensionality in contrast with existing clustering-based fault detection methods and can also detect contextual faults that are undetectable using existing statistical techniques.",2010,2010-01-01,10,"Annual Conference of the Prognostics and Health Management Society, Phm 2010",algorithms; clustering algorithms; cyber physical systems (cpss); data dimensionality; data mining; diagnosis hypothesis; embedded systems; fault detection; fault detection algorithm; individual components; statistical hypothesis testing; statistical independence; statistical techniques; testing; theorem proving,"Srivastava, N.

"Zhou, C.",Are banks too big to fail measuring systemic importance of financial institutions,"This paper considers three measures of the systemic importance of a financial institution within an interconnected financial system. The measures are applied to study the relation between the size of a financial institution and its systemic importance. Both the theoretical model and empirical analysis reveal that, when analyzing the systemic risk posed by one financial institution to the system, size should not be considered as a proxy of systemic importance. In other words, the ""too big to fail"" argument is not always valid, and measures of systemic importance should be considered.We provide the estimation methodology of systemic importance measures under the multivariate extreme value theory (EVT) framework.",2010,2010-01-01,97,International Journal of Central Banking,,"Zhou, C.

"Williams, B.; Prather, L.",Bank risk and return: the impact of bank non-interest income,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to consider the impact on bank risk of portfolio diversification between traditional margin income and fee-based income for banks operating in Australia. Design methodology approach: Considering several performance variables, this analysis compares the benefits of diversification across different bank types relative to margin income and fee income. Further, regression analysis considers bank risk and revenue concentration. Findings: This paper documents that fee-based income is riskier than margin income but offers diversification benefits to bank shareholders. While improving bank risk-return tradeoff, these benefits are of second order importance compared to the large negative impact of poor asset quality on shareholder returns. Practical implications: These have implications for all stakeholders in Australian banks. The suggest that shareholders of banks will benefit from increased bank exposure to non-interest income via diversification. From a regulatory perspective, diversification reduces the possibility of systemic risk, but caution must be offered with respect to banks pursuing absolute returns rather than monitoring risk-return trade-offs, and so exploiting the benefits of the implied guarantee offered by ""too big to fail"" However, shareholders should also monitor bank exposure to non interest income to ensure that they do not become over-exposed to the point where the volatility effect outweighs the diversification benefits. Originality value: The of this study suggest that Australian regulators should consider requiring increased disclosure of the composition of bank non-interest income. Such disclosure would aid in understanding the changing nature of banking in Australia. Given the recent sub-prime crisis in the USA and the role played by fee based income sourced from securitization, increased disclosure of the nature of bank non interest income is now of global importance. This disclosure is particularly germane within the context of the implementation of Basle II, with its increased emphasis upon market discipline, given that Stiroh found increased disclosure in this area is accompanied by improved market pricing for risk.

In newly promulgated regulations addressing the ""breaking of the buck"" in the $3 trillion money market-a debacle at the fulcrum of the 2008 financial meltdown-the SEC endorses practices that obfuscate rather than illuminate the capital markets, including fixed pricing for money market funds, potentially riskier portfolio requirements, and the continued use of discredited ratings agencies. These policies, premised implicitly upon doubt in the ability of markets to process information effectively, obscure the true perils of money market funds.

This paper critically reviews the extensive EWS literature and typology and proposes a new class of supervisory models. The paper also discusses important design implications for an efficient EWS. The new class of supervisory models for systemic risk should be built from an integrated perspective and model EWS according to the users'and competencies. It should incorporate both microprudential and macroprudential perspectives, as well as the structural considerations of the financial system itself. From the financial supervisor's point of view, an EWS involves an ex ante approach to regulation designed to highlight conditions that have in the past been associated with systemic risk. Forward-looking supervisory instruments become more important as they allow ex ante policy action and can reduce the need for ex post regulation. Dieter Gramlich, Gavin L. Miller, Mikhail V.

"Prelipcean, G.",Emerging micro finance solutions for response and recovery in the case of natural hazards,"The serious floods caused by heavy rainfall at the end of July 2008, affected many densely populated areas in Romania. Over 5900 houses, of which 1600 totally destroyed, and more than 21000 people were reported by local authorities to have been affected by the floods. The most affected areas were situated in Maramures, in Moldova, along the Prut and Siret rivers. These areas include critical infrastructure elements (town halls, border police offices, roads, dams, civil protection facilities) and had a negative impact on the economic activity. The assessment of the effects of the disaster, conducted by the Operational Centre for Emergency Situations (OCES) under the Romanian Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, has demonstrated the increase of the risk level with implications as systemic risk. Considering the multiple effects and the serious micro and macroeconomic implications, the intervention of the governmental institutions must be prompt and efficient. The lack of experience in the case of these extreme risk events, but also the budgetary restrictions, require, on the one hand, the reassessment of the insurance solutions through the of a new financing scheme based on PPP, or the use of the microfinance products specifically created for natural hazards risk management, on the other hand. Microfinance institutions could be efficient both in disasters, and also in events that correspond to the disaster response and the recovery process. Microfinance institutions could be easily informed on the potential consequences of natural hazards at different levels: clients, institutions, sectors. Microfinance products and services could be robust solutions, because they respond more directly to clients needs in the aftermath of extreme events. Identifying the optimal lending program is a difficult task and it is closely related to the global recovery process. The design of these specific products represents an important contribution in order to develop an efficient recovery process, as the funds will be used more efficiently and promptly, and we consider that innovative solutions should be used for Romania and for other emerging countries.",2010,2010-01-01,3,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Risk Management, Assessment and Mitigation, Rima '10",affected area; civil protection; critical infrastructures; disaster response; economic activities; economics; emergency situation; extreme events; extreme risk management (erm); finance; financing schemes; floods; governmental institution; heavy rainfall; innovative solutions; local authorities; microfinance; microfinance institutions (mfis); microinsurance; multiple effect; natural hazard; negative impacts; products and services; rain; rating; recovery; recovery process; risk analysis; risk levels; risk management; robust solutions; romania; societies and institutions; sustainable development,"Prelipcean, G.

In contrast, the largely unregulated global hedge fund industry navigated through the crisis relatively unscathed. As a consequence of the GFC, there is a tidal wave of opinion calling for reform of the global financial architecture, with a specific emphasis on tightened oversight of hedge funds. In this article, we consider the debate regarding the future of hedge fund regulation, building the case that regulatory reform to constrain excessive leverage must be applied in equal measure to all financial market participants, not just hedge funds.

"Borgy, V.; Clerc, L.; Renne, J.-P.",House price boom bust cycles: identification issues and macro-prudential implications,"Over the recent months, several initiatives have taken place to develop macro-prudential regulation in order to prevent systemic risk and the build-up of financial imbalances. These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to ourreal long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom. 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2010,2010-01-01,1,Housing Markets in Europe: a Macroeconomic Perspective,asset price booms and busts; discrete-choice model; early warning indicators; leaning against the wind policies; macro-prudential regulation,"Borgy, V.

By revealing information on a common fundamental factor and thereby affecting the behavior of creditors, the failure of a single firm can trigger the failure of another firm. The model provides a unique equilibrium framework to assess the consequences of contagion and yields some hitherto unnoticed insights. While contagion increases the correlation among the financial failures of different firms, its impact on the incidence of failure is ambiguous.consider an analytically tractable version of the model in which the effect on the ex ante failure probabilities is exactly zero. Moreover, the impact of contagion increases with the relevance of a common underlying fundamental, but is limited to firms near the brink of success or failure. 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2010,2010-01-01,12,European Economic Review,equilibrium; financial contagion; financial crisis; global games; investment; investor learning; numerical model; systemic risk,"Manz, M.

"Carpenter, D.H.",Insolvency of systemically significant financial companies: bankruptcy vs conservatorship receivership,"One clear lesson of the 2008 recession, which brought Goliaths such as Bear Sterns, CitiGroup, AIG, and Washington Mutual to their knees, is that no financial institution, regardless of its size, complexity, or diversification, is invincible. Congress, as a result, is left with the question of how best to handle the failure of systemically significant financial companies (SSFCs). In the United States, the insolvencies of depository institutions (i.e., banks and thrifts with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)) are not handled according to the procedures of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Instead, they and their subsidiaries are subject to a separate regime prescribed in federal law, called a conservatorship or receivership. Under this regime, the conservator or receiver, which generally is the FDIC, is provided substantial authority to deal with virtually every aspect of the insolvency. However, the failure of most other financial institutions within bank, thrift, and financial holding company umbrellas (including the holding companies themselves) generally are dealt with under the Bankruptcy Code. In March of 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner proposed legislation that would impose a conservatorship receivership regime, much like that for depository institutions, on insolvent financial institutions that are deemed systemically significant. In order to make a policy assessment concerning the appropriateness of this proposal, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences between insured depositories and other financial institutions large enough or interconnected enough to pose systemic risk to the U.S. economy upon failure, as well as the differences between the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the FDIC's conservatorship receivership authority. This report first discusses the purposes behind the creation of a separate insolvency regime for depository institutions. The report then compares and contrasts the characteristics of depository institutions with SSFCs. Next, the report provides a brief analysis of some important differences between the FDIC's conservatorship receivership authority and that of the Bankruptcy Code. The specific differences discussed are: (1) overallof each regime (2) insolvency initiation authority and timing (3) oversight structure and appeal (4) management, shareholder, and creditor rights (5) FDIC -superpowers, including contract repudiation versus Bankruptcy's automatic stay and (6) speed of resolution. This report makes no value judgment as to whether an insolvency regime for SSFCs that is modeled after the FDIC's conservatorship receivership authority is more appropriate than using (or adapting) the Bankruptcy Code. Rather, it simply points out the similarities and differences between SSFCs and depository institutions, and compares the conservatorship receivership insolvency regime with the Bankruptcy Code to help the reader develop his her own opinion. 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",2010,2010-01-01,0,Insolvency Issues and the Fdic,,"Carpenter, D.H.

This article derives an argument for expansion from developments in the financial markets. Traditionally, mitigating systemic risk has fallen within the realm of financial institution (i.e., prudential) regulation rather than securities law. However, developments in financial markets, including the bundling and sale of securitized products by a variety of complex institutions, are blurring the line between prudential regulation and securities law. This evolution makes systemic risk increasingly relevant to securities regulation.

Unlike previous financial crisis, one major driver of this crisis is the contagious failures of banks through a network of interbank payments and correlated bank portfolios of financial products. The risk that the failure of a single bank can cause a cascading failure of other connected banks and may potentially bring down the entire banking system (network), is defined as systemic risk. Existing bank risk management research focused on the causes and impacts of systemic risk but largely ignored the monitoring and preventive mechanism. In this study, we developed a network-based algorithm to rank systemic risk of banks and financial products in the bank network.

"Kane, E.J.",Redefining and containing systemic risk,"Official definitions of systemic risk leave out the role of government officials in generating it. Policymakers' support of creative forms of risk-taking and their proclivity for absorbing losses in crisis situations encourage opportunistic firms to foster and exploit incentive conflicts within the supervisory sector. To restore faith in the diligence, competence, and integrity of officials responsible for managing the financial safety net, reforms need to rework incentives in the government and financial sectors. The goal should be to align the incentives of private risk managers, accountants, credit-rating firms, and government supervisors with those of ordinary taxpayers. This article describes a series of complementary ways of advancing toward this goal. The most important steps would be to measure regulatory performance in terms of its effect on the loss exposures that the safety net passes through to taxpayers and to require institutions that benefit from the net to produce information that would support this effort. This entails estimating the explicit and implicit safety-net benefits individual institutions receive and issuing extended liability securities whose prices would improve the accuracy of these estimates. 2010 International Atlantic Economic Society.",2010,2010-01-01,28,Atlantic Economic Journal,financial crisis; insolvency detection; safety net subsidies; systemic risk,"Kane, E.J.

The imposition of such capital charges could go a long way towards internalizing the negative externalities associated with too-connected-to-fail institutions and providing managerial incentives to strengthen an institution's solvency position, and avoid too much homogeneity and excessive reliance on the same counterparties in the financial industry. 2010 New York University Salomon Center and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2010,2010-01-01,29,"Financial Markets, Institutions and Instruments",corisk; financial institutions; incremental portfolio; network analysis; perimeter of regulation; regulatory capital; risk budgeting; systemic risk; too-connected-to-fail,"Chan-Lau, J.A.

There are many mathematical models for measuring the risk, but now, we know at the very least, they didn't disclosure risks. The efficient market hypothesis postulates that markets tend towards equilibrium. But the efficient market hypothesis is unrealistic. There is systemic risk in the market in addition to the risks most market participants perceived prior to the crisis.

"Overmyer, M.I.","The ""foreign private adviser"" exemption: A potential gap in the new systemic risk regulatory architecture","Since the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, policymakers have generally agreed that hedge funds can add to systemic risk in the U.S. economy. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (WSRCPA) aims in part to address this risk by granting regulators the authority to impose prudential requirements on hedge funds. Crucial to the effectiveness of this authority will be the ability of regulators to timely and accurately identify which funds should be subject to such requirements. The WSRCPA requires U.S. hedge fund managers to self-identify the funds they manage by registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In contrast, foreign hedge fund managers whose funds do not include a threshold number of U.S. investors or amount of capital managed on behalf of U.S. investors are not required to register. As a result, to fulfill their statutory responsibility to protect the U.S. economy from systemic risks, regulators will themselves need to identify which foreign funds could pose a risk to the U.S. economy. The scope and quality of public information and the potential unreliability of international cooperation make it unlikely that U.S. regulators can accurately, promptly, and efficiently identify such funds. Exempting foreign hedge fund managers from the registration requirement therefore frustrates the ability of U.S. regulators to manage systemic risk. To fill this gap, managers of foreign hedge funds that meet thresholds for holdings of U.S. assets and obligations to U.S. lenders should be made to register with the SEC. Although the opportunity to narrow the WSRCPA's ""foreign private adviser"" exemption has passed, an alternative vehicle for bringing about self-identification exists in the SEC's proposed Large Trader Reporting System rule.",2010,2010-01-01,2,Columbia Law Review,,"Overmyer, M.I.

Their efficacy in the treatment and palliative care of patient with these diseases is indisputable, but avascular osteonecrosis of the jaws (B-ONJ) has recently been reported as an adverse effect of intravenous BP therapy and with prolonged therapy with oral BPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the most recent scientific literature on B-ONJ in an attempt to characterize this adverse event from an epidemiological point of view and to elaborate guidelines for its diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.B-ONJ usually arises in the mandible, in most cases at the level of mylohyoid line involvement of the upper jaw is less common. It normally occurs after a dental extraction or other types of oral surgery, but it can also develop spontaneously. In cases of the latter type, systemic risk factors (e.g., comorbidities, concomitant therapies), or local pathological anatomical conditions of the oral cavity play an important role. For patients without identified risk factors, intravenous BP therapy is associated with an estimated incidence of B-ONJ between 0.8 and 1.15% figures may be as high as 9.1% if these patients undergo dentoalveolar surgery. In patients treated with oral BF, the incidence rate ranges from 0.01 to 0.04% and increases to 0.09%-0.34% after extractions. None of the treatments currentIy used to treat B-ONJ are completely effective and predictable, so prevention is essential for patients receiving BPs. Oral and dental risk factors should be eliminated before BP therapy begins, and this requires close collaboration by the patient's physician and dentist. After BP therapy has been started, there are relative contraindications to dentoalveolar surgery, and only unavoidable procedures should be performed. If B-ONJ develops, the best clinical are achieved with combined treatment that includes antibiotics, antiseptic mouthwashes, surgical removal of necrotic bone, surgical debridement, biostimulation with low-level laser therapy and ozone-therapy.B-ONJ is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of BP therapy. It can produce significant morbidity and severely diminish the quality of life. The prognosis appears poor even when appropriate treatment is provided. Since the first cases of B-ONJ have been reported, considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease and its risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, therapy, and management of the complications.",2010,2010-01-01,0,Dental Cadmos,adverse effects; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; bisphosphonates; bisphosphonic acid derivative; debridement; dental surgery; dentist; drug efficacy; human; jaw osteonecrosis; mouthwash; oral pathology; osteonecrosis; palliative therapy; pathogenesis; physician; prevention; quality of life; review; risk factor; tooth extraction,"Annibali, S.

"McIlroy, D.",The regulatory issues raised by credit default swaps,"This article considers the regulatory issues raised by the increased use of credit default swaps (CDSs). It argues that the current extensive over-the-counter trading of CDSs raises problems in terms of the opacity of risk, misaligned incentives in the event of default by reference entities, and concentrations of counterparty risk, each of which requires addressing. Among the proposals discussed are the standardisation of CDSs, the use of central counterparties, the of exchange trading of CDSs, the imposition of capital penalties on bespoke CDSs or mandatory collateralisation, limiting the extent to which CDSs can be used to hedge a position fully, the prohibition of naked CDS protection and the of large exposure counterparty limits. The article concludes that while standardisation and exchange trading of CDSs should be promoted, mandatory collateralisation is preferable to the use of capital penalties. Naked CDS protection buying should be prohibited unless measures can be put in place to ensure that it does not have adverse effects in the event of default by reference entities. Systemic risk in the CDS markets should be addressed through the of large exposure counterparty limits. 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",2010,2010-01-01,3,Journal of Banking Regulation,collateralisation; credit default swaps; exchange trading; financial services regulation; over the counter; standardisation,"McIlroy, D.

In a simple currencychoice portfolio model, we show that a strategy of reducing dollarization, if it fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks, leads to higher domestic real interest rates. We confirm this prediction in an empirical panel-based model, involving systemic risk variables, but find that the effect is small after controlling for the risks of dilution and default. We apply our empirical estimates to the case of Brazila natural case study given its low degree of financial dollarization and very high real interest rates. The estimated model is unable to explain the high interest rate levels in the aftermath of Brazil's 1994 inflation stabilization. However, since the adoption in 1999 of inflation targeting and floating exchange rates, Brazil's real interest rates are found to be gradually converging to the model's predicted values.

Newer coronary CTA technology such as prospective ECG-gating will also enable lower dose examinations. Since the current standard of care for coronary diagnoses is catheterization, CT will continue to be benchmarked against catheterization reference points, in particular temporal resolution, spatial resolution, radiation dose, and volume coverage. This article focuses on single heart beat cardiac acquisitions enabled by 320-detector row CT. Imaging with this system can now be performed with patient radiation doses comparable to catheterization. The high image quality, excellent contrast opacification, and absence of stair-step artifact provide the potential to evaluate endothelial shear stress (ESS) noninvasively with CT. Low ESS is known to lead to the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaque culminating in high-risk vulnerable plaque likely to rupture and cause an acute coronary event. The magnitude of local low ESS, in combination with the local remodeling response and the severity of systemic risk factors, determines the natural history of each plaque. This paper describes the steps required to derive an ESS map from 320-detector row CT data using the Lattice Boltzmann method to include the complex geometry of the coronary arterial tree. This approach diminishes the limitations of other computational fluid dynamics methods to properly evaluate multiple coronary arteries, including the complex geometry of coronary bifurcations where lesions tend to develop.

"Fritz, S.J.",Private equity and its impact,"This book looks at the increase in leveraged buyouts (LBO) of U.S. companies by private equity funds prior to the slowdown in mid-2007 which has raised questions about the potential impact of these deals. Some praise LBOs for creating new governance structures for companies and providing longer term investment opportunities for investors. Others criticize LBOs for causing job losses and burdening companies with too much debt. This book addresses the effect of recent private equity LBOs on acquired companies and employment, the impact of LBOs jointly undertaken by two or more private equity funds on competition, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of private equity funds and their advisers, and regulatory oversight of commercial and investment banks that have financed recent LBOs. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed academic research, analyzed recent LBO data, conducted case studies, reviewed regulators' policy documents and examinations, and interviewed regulatory and industry officials, and academics. The GAO recommends that the federal financial regulators give increased attention to ensuring that their oversight of leveraged lending at their regulated institutions takes into consideration systemic risk implications raised by changes in the broader financial markets. 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To determine whether a patient's age, gender, local or systemic risk factors affect the rate of preoperative bacterial contamination. Methods. Consecutive 1,474 patients undergoing intraocular surgery were enrolled in this prospective masked study. Past medical history was noted and examinations were performed. The patients were divided into four groups: a control group (without local or systemic risk factors), those with local risk factors (chronic use of topical medications, contact lens wear, blepharitis, chronic eyelid or conjunctival inflammation), those with systemic risk factors (immunosuppression, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, and asthma), and those with both. Conjunctival cultures were obtained before surgery.Among the 1,474 patients, 914 bacteria were isolated from 214 (14.9%) patients. Advanced age was associated with a higher rate of positive conjunctival cultures (p 0.005). No statistical difference was found with regard to gender (p 0.7173). Among the 282 patients in the control group, 14 (5%) had a positive conjunctival culture. Compared to the control group, positive conjunctival cultures were found in 118 out of 503 patients (23.5%) with local risk factors (p 0.0001), 65 out of 545 patients (11.9%) with systemic risk factors (p 0.0019), and 22 out of 144 (15.3%) with both (p 0.0006). Two patients developed postoperative endophthalmitis (0.14%), one with both local risk and systemic factors and the other with a systemic risk factor.Patients with local or systemic risk factors or advanced age were found to have a higher rate of bacterial conjunctival contamination before intraocular surgery.

"Briggs, D.J.; Sabel, C.E.; Lee, K.",Uncertainty in epidemiology and health risk and impact assessment,"Environmental epidemiology and health risk and impact assessment have long grappled with problems of uncertainty in data and their relationships. These uncertainties have become more challenging because of the complex, systemic nature of many of the risks. A clear framework defining and quantifying uncertainty is needed. Three dimensions characterise uncertainty: its nature, its location and its level. In terms of its nature, uncertainty can be both intrinsic and extrinsic. The former reflects the effects of complexity, sparseness and nonlinearity the latter arises through inadequacies in available observational data, measurement methods, sampling regimes and models. Uncertainty occurs in three locations: conceptualising the problem, analysis and communicating theMost attention has been devoted to characterising and quantifying the analysis-a wide range of statistical methods has been developed to estimate analytical uncertainties and model their propagation through the analysis. In complex systemic risks, larger uncertainties may be associated with conceptualisation of the problem and communication of the analyticalboth of which depend on the perspective and viewpoint of the observer. These imply using more participatory approaches to investigation, and more qualitative measures of uncertainty, not only to define uncertainty more inclusively and completely, but also to help those involved better understand the nature of the uncertainties and their practical implications.

Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but serious adverse effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Due to inhibitory actions on bone turnover, bisphosphonate therapy may result in the accumulation of microdamage. Case summary: A 74-year-old Korean woman (height, 150 cm weight, 51 kg) was referred to the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea, for evaluation of pain and persistent abnormal exposure of jaw bone after extraction of teeth. She had been receiving weekly oral alendronate treatment for osteoporosis for years. The patient had the clinical features of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the mandible, which was precipitated by teeth extraction 14 months prior to the outpatient referral visit. At her clinical baseline visit, serum hormone concentrations and bone turnover markers were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone, 0.88 μIU mL (reference range, 0.25-5.00 μIU mL) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 20.9 (9.0-37.6) ng mL parathyroid hormone (PTH), 57 (11-62) pg mL serum osteocalcin, 8.7 (12.9-55.9) ng mL and urine N-telopeptide 21 (26-124) nM mM creatinine. She had multiple systemic risk factors for ONJ, including older age, typediabetes mellitus, and long duration of bisphosphonate therapy. There was no mandibular lesion improvement despite repeated surgical procedures performed within a 14-month period. Bisphosphonate therapy was discontinued and PTH therapy was started. Aftermonths, exposed oral mucosa had healed. Aftermonths of treatment, the pain had completely subsided, and aftermonths the patient's eating and drinking habits returned. The serum concentration of osteocalcin, a bone formation marker, which was initially suppressed (8.7 ng mL), increased 174% (15.1 ng mL) from baseline aftermonths of treatment with PTH.Here we report a probable case of oral bisphosphonate-associated ONJ featuring suppressed bone turnover. Treatment with the bone formation-stimulating agent PTH was beneficial. 2008 Excerpta Medica Inc.

Equity decoupling involves unbundling of economic, voting, and sometimes other rights customarily associated with shares, often in ways that may permit avoidance of disclosure and other obligations. We discuss a new U.S. court decision which will likely curtail the use of equity decoupling strategies to avoid large shareholder disclosure rules. Debt decoupling involving the unbundling of the economic rights, contractual control rights, and legal and other rights normally associated with debt, through credit derivatives and securitisation. Corporations can have empty and hidden creditors, just as they can have empty and hidden shareholders. 'Hybrid decoupling' across standard equity and debt categories is also possible. All forms of decoupling appear to be increasingly common. Debt decoupling can pose risks at the firm level for what can be termed 'debt governance'the overall relationship between creditor and debtor, including creditors' exercise of contractual and legal rights with respect to firms and other borrowers. Widespread debt decoupling can also involve externalities and therefore create systemic financial risks we explore those risks. 2008 The Authors.",2008,2008-01-01,97,European Financial Management,cdos; credit default swaps; debt decoupling; disclosure; empty voting; equity decoupling; equity swaps; hidden ownership; hybrid decoupling; securities and exchange commission; securitisation; systemic risk,"Hu, H.T.C.

"Fankhauser, S.; Agrawala, S.; Hanrahan, D.; Pope, G.; Skees, J.; Stephens, C.; Yasmine, S.",Economic and policy instruments to promote adaptation,"Adaptation to climate change will comprise of thousands of actions by households, firms, governments, and civil society. This chapter provides some pointers as to how smart policy can turn private initiative into a force for adaptation. It focuses on three instruments: Insurance, environmental markets and public private partnerships. Insurance has a long track record as a way to share weather risks. However, as climate damages grow insurance will become riskier. Public policy measures will be needed to overcome this problem, for example through publicly funded adaptation measures that bring down risks or by sharing the most extreme layer of risks with commercial insurers. Public policy should not, however, subsidise the systemic risks, as this may sustain activities that become progressively less viable under the changing climate. Environmental markets and pricing have a key role to play in the preservation of natural systems, even without climate change. They incentivise owners to preserve natural assets and consumers to use them carefully. From an adaptation point of view, environmental markets and pricing serve two main purposes. First, they reduce baseline stress, making systems more resilient. Second, they can help to monetise the adaptation services provided by ecosystems. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), meanwhile, can help to overcome operational constraints and accelerate investment in infrastructure, which will likely be the most expensive part of adaptation and, therefore, put considerable strain on the administrative and financial capacity of governments. PPPs may also play a role in research and development and the search for better adaptation technologies.

We investigated whether non-uniform shear stress at bifurcations induces pro-atherogenic endothelial dysfunction and monocyte recruitment. Bifurcating flow-through cell culture slides were used to expose HUVECs to laminar or non-uniform shear stress for 18at 10 dyne cm 2. For the adhesion assay, HUVECs were subsequently perfused with medium containing THP-1 monocytes forh. Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence. In areas exposed to laminar shear stress, alignment of endothelial cells with the flow was observed, accompanied by upregulation of eNOS and downregulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In contrast, cells exposed to non-uniform shear stress near the outer walls of bifurcations were characterized by irregular, unaligned shape, induction of endothelin-1 and CTGF, as well as reduced eNOS expression. These atherogenic effects of non-uniform shear stress were prevented when cells were treated with statins (1 μmol l) during flow. Under non-uniform shear stress, a slight induction of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E- P-selectin was observed. In agreement with this, monocyte recruitment, which was nearly undetectable under laminar shear stress, was moderately induced by non-uniform shear stress (P lt 0.02). In conclusion, inhibition of antioxidative eNOS and upregulation of atherogenic proteins is the first step in non-uniform shear stress-mediated endothelial dysfunction, which in vivo in the presence of atherogenic risk factors may further enhance monocyte recruitment into the artery wall. 2008IOS Press and the authors.

"Kramer, A.; Hübner, N.; Below, H.; Heidecke, C.-D.; Assadian, O.",Improving adherence to surgical hand preparation,"Summary: At present, no universal agreement on detailed practice for surgical hand preparation exists. In order to fill this gap, in 2002 a Franco-German recommendation for surgical hand preparation was published as a first step towards a generally accepted European recommendation. Based on an assessment of the actual literature, a protocol for surgical hand preparation is discussed with the aim to recommend evidence-based standard procedures including prerequisites, washing and disinfection phase, and its practical implementation. In contrast to hygienic hand disinfection, for surgical hand preparation compliance is not an issue, since it mostly is regarded as a ceremony which is carried out without exception. Nevertheless, the following factors influence acceptance and efficacy: skin tolerance, ease of use, duration of procedure, and recommended time), potential for impaired efficacy due to incorrect performance of the procedure, possibility of systemic risks and irritating potential by applied preparations, religious restrictions, ecological aspects, costs and safety. Here, we report our experience with the of a new hand preparation regime in all surgical disciplines in our university hospital based on the above factors. The following statements were evaluated: The immediate efficacy of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant is impaired by a preceding hand wash for up to 10 minutes. Therefore hands should not be routinely washed before the disinfection period unless there is a good reason for it such as visible soiling. A shortened application time (1.5 minutes) is equal tomin in terms of efficacy. Hands should be air dried before gloves are put on, otherwise the perforation rate of gloves will increase. The efficacy of alcohol-based disinfectants is significantly higher when hands are allowed to dry forminute after the washing phase and before the disinfection phase. To clarify the above questions before the establishment of the modified technique, the surgical team was invited to a meeting. As a result, the heads of surgical departments supported the new technique and decided to change their practice. 2008 The Hospital Infection Society.",2008,2008-01-01,22,Journal of Hospital Infection,2 propanol; alcohol; anaphylaxis; article; chlorhexidine; clinical protocol; clinical trial; compliance; contact dermatitis; disinfectant agent; disinfection; dry skin; evidence based medicine; experimental-based surgical hand disinfection; france; germany; hand washing; hospital cost; human; infection risk; intermethod comparison; medical education; nonhuman; post surgical hand hygiene; postoperative period; povidone iodine; practice guideline; preoperative period; propanol; religion; safety; skin defect; skin irritation; soap; sulfur; surgical hand preparation; surgical infection; surgical ward; triclosan,"Kramer, A.

However, previous reports on the topic are conflicting. The of the present cross-sectional study was therefore to compare the oral health parameters of a racially and socio-economically homogeneous group of women who gave birth before 259 gestational days (37 weeks) with those of women who went full-term. Material and Methods. We studied various dental parameters, including prevalence of dental caries, gingival bleeding on probing, the probing periodontal pocket depths, and the carriage of periodontal pathogens in 328 all-Caucasian women with singleton births. Seventy-seven of the women had preterm births, while 251 had full-term. Dental data were recorded withindays postpartum and analyzed with data from medical history, prenatal care, and delivery records.Preterm mothers had more dental caries (93.5%) than full-term mothers (85.3%) when assessed as carious teeth in the mouth (p 0.06). In clinical and microbiological periodontal health parameters, however, no differences could be seen between the preterm and full-term mothers. Primiparity, low weight-gain, and antimicrobial drug use during pregnancy were the significant predictors for preterm birth.Although we cannot make any causal linkage, the oral health parameters were no different in women who experienced preterm births compared with those who had full-term births in this cohort.

"Lorenz, J.; Battiston, S.",Systemic risk in a network fragility model analyzed with probability density evolution of persistent random walks,"We study the mean field approximation of a recent model of cascades on networks relevant to the investigation of systemic risk control in financial networks. In the model, the hypothesis of a trend reinforcement in the stochastic process describing the fragility of the nodes, induces a trade-off in the systemic risk with respect to the density of the network. Increasing the average link density, the network is first less exposed to systemic risk, while above an intermediate value the systemic risk increases. This result offers a simple explanation for the emergence of instabilities in financial systems that get increasingly interwoven. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the probability density function of the average fragility. This converges to a unique stationary distribution which can be computed numerically and can be used to estimate the systemic risk as a function of the parameters of the model.

This unprecedented scale of deregulation and the concomitant absence of systemic risk controls were facilitated by a radically lopsided political economy in the North. This was, in turn, held up by an extremely lopsided global division of labour. Export-surplus-fuelled liquidity and excessive deregulation combined to exacerbate the cyclical nature of banking systems that follow from the credit nature of money, leading to massive booms and searing busts.

"Hahn, C.; Schwartz, M.A.",The role of cellular adaptation to mechanical forces in atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that originates at regions of arteries exposed to disturbances in fluid flow and in progressive plaque formation in those areas. Recent work on cellular responses to flow has identified potential mechanosensors and pathways that may influence disease progression. These led us to hypothesize that the same mechanisms that mediate adaptive responses in the vasculature become maladaptive at sites of disturbed flow. Subsequent changes in gene expression and matrix remodeling help to entrain these inflammatory pathways. These events synergize with systemic risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, smoking, and diabetes, leading to disease progression. 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.",2008,2008-01-01,80,"Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology","adaptation; adaptation, physiological; animals; atherosclerosis; biomechanics; cigarette smoking; diabetes mellitus; disease course; disturbed flow; endothelial; endothelial cells; extracellular matrix; fluid shear stress; gene expression; human; humans; hyperlipidemia; inflammation; laminar flow; mechanotransduction; mechanotransduction, cellular; membrane fluidity; models, cardiovascular; myocytes, smooth muscle; priority journal; reactive oxygen metabolite; reactive oxygen species; risk factor; shear stress; short survey; signal transduction; smooth muscle","Hahn, C.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data 1999 to 2005. Demographic data and injury severity score were obtained from medical records. Factors reviewed included perioperative complications (nonunion, postoperative infection, loss of fixation) and time to radiographic and clinical union.Forty-seven patients with 16 distal femur and 36 proximal tibia fractures were treated using temporary EF. Patients subsequently underwent ORIF (mean time from EF to ORIF days, range 1-23 days). Thirty-five fractures were open (Gustilo8, II 6, IIIA 3, IIIB 13, IIIC 5) and 17 closed. Forty patients with 44 fractures reached 1-year follow-up. Of these, 36 patients with 40 (91%) fractures had healed both radiographically and clinically. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 14 months (range 3-68). Eight (16%) deep infections occurred, all in open fractures (Gustilo2, IIIB 3, IIIC 3), with one patient requiring above knee amputation. Other complications included one hematoma, two malunions, one fixation failure, and one pin site infection. One patient died as a result of a stroke. AND SIGNIFICANCE: Temporary bridging EF offers the advantage of early soft tissue and bone stabilization without the potential local risks of immediate ORIF in severely injured soft tissues, or the potential systemic risks in a severely traumatized patient. The 16% infection rate in this study, all occurring in open fractures, falls within the reported range for grade III open fractures (15%-20%). We conclude that the initial treatment of high-energy periarticular knee fractures with bridging EF, followed by planned conversion to internal fixation is a safe option in patients who are unsuitable for initial definitive surgery. 2008 Lippincott Williams Wilkins, Inc.",2008,2008-01-01,53,"Journal of Trauma - Injury, Infection and Critical Care",adolescent; adult; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; conversion; external; female; femoral fractures; femur fracture; fixation; follow up; fracture; fracture external fixation; fracture fixation; hematoma; human; humans; infection; injury scale; internal; knee; knee amputation; male; medical record; middle aged; osteosynthesis; perioperative complication; postoperative care; postoperative complication; postoperative complications; priority journal; proximal tibia fracture; retrospective studies; stroke; temporary; tibial fractures; treatment failure; treatment outcome,"Parekh, A.A.

METHODS: We reviewed patient demographics, ocular findings, and clinical courses for 25 patients receiving systemic anticoagulation with warfarin who subsequently underwent vitreoretinal surgery.Patient ages ranged from 49 years to 81 years (median, 69 years). Indications for anticoagulation included atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, deep vein thrombosis, prosthetic heart valves, and hypercoagulable state. Follow-up ranged frommonths to 36 months (median, 19.5 months). The international normalized ratio ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 (median, 2.0). Final vision after surgery ranged from 20 20 to 20 400 (median, 20 100). One patient who underwent scleral buckling and external drainage of subretinal fluid had an intraoperative subretinal hemorrhage associated with the drainage procedure. In all other patients, no intraoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Cessation of therapy with warfarin may not be necessary in patients receiving anticoagulation who are undergoing vitreoretinal procedures. Successful visual and anatomical may be achieved after vitreoretinal surgery for patients receiving anticoagulation with warfarin. The management of anticoagulation should occur in conjunction with the patient's internist to allow a clear understanding of the potential systemic risks of cessation of warfarin treatment preoperatively.

"Wenisch, H.J.C.; Marusch, F.",Postoperative anastomosis insufficiency in the lower gastrointestinal tract Postoperative anastomoseninsuffizienzen am unteren gastrointestinaltrakt,"Leakage of anastomosis is the most severe complication in surgery of the lower gastrointestinal tract. The incidence is significant higher after resections of the rectum compared to anastomoses of the colon. The development of insufficiencies might be increased depending on defined local or systemic risk factors, but hardly cannot be predicted for individual cases. Clinical symptoms depend on volume and site of the leakage, mostly between dayand dayafter surgery. Further therapy after early diagnosis by endoscopy, colon contrast imaging, or CAT-Scan. After establishment of diagnosis, the decision on further management must be made individually regarding the special situation of the individual patient. In smaller, well-drained leakages, conservative treatment might be sufficient. Local abscesses might be drained interventionally. In doubtful situations or in cases with peritonitis, early relaparotomies are required. The operative management is decided knowing the intraoperative situs. Leakages must be drained, and in most of the cases a consequent peritoneal lavage will be necessary. When insufficiencies are diagnosed very early, treatment by suture might be possible. Is the situation caused by compromised circulation, further resection with or without consecutive anastomosis might be necessary. Diversion colostomy should be used as the treatment of choice in all high risk patients or in complicated local situations promising better outcomes and allowing relaparotomies for repeated lavages.

"Siasos, G.; Tousoulis, D.; Siasou, Z.; Stefanadis, C.; Papavassiliou, A.G.","Shear stress, protein kinases and atherosclerosis","Shear stress represents the frictional force that the flow of blood exerts at the endothelial surface of the vessel wall and plays a central role in cell function and structure via managing several processes and contributes to the progress of atherosclerosis. It is a fact that interaction of blood flow and the endothelial surface is the critical interface for shear stress-dependent mechanotransduction. Vascular endothelial cells are equipped with numerous receptors in order to ""sense"" and react to mechanical forces elicited by shear stress. The intracellular signal transduction pathways and specifically the activation of protein kinases, is the second important molecular event underpinning cellular reactions to extracellular stimuli. MAPKs, comprising ERK1 2, JNKs stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), and p38s, are serine threonine protein kinases with a prominent role in cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis, by modulating the activity of downstream target proteins and various transcription factors, hence gene expression programs. Shear stress (nonlaminar or disturbed blood flow) plays an important role in atherosclerosis, where flow conditions are characterized by low or oscillatory shear stress. Atherosclerosis is promoted by decreased shear stress, as it is associated with a suppression of functions taking place on the vascular wall, such as eNOs production and endothelial cell repair. In the presence of systemic risk factors, there is an increased tendency for atherosclerotic plaque formation, which, once formed, further disrupt flow and forward growth of the fibroinflammatory lipid plaque.

"Muoz, F.J.C.",The use of collateral in gross and net payment systems,"The purpose of this paper is to make a comparative analysis of modern gross and net payment systems, emphasizing the implications of the availability of intraday liquidity in the former, and of collateral requirements in the latter. In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: eligible as collateral and not eligible, with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisionswhich affects their returnand on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model. In a calibration exercise, it is shown how it would be legitimate for a benevolent authority to have a preference for a gross system, like TARGET, over a net system, like EURO1, for relatively high values, although plausible, of risk aversion.",2007,2007-01-01,2,European Journal of Finance,collateral; contagion; euro1; european union; gross payment system; intraday liquidity; net payment system; payment systems; systemic risk; target,"Muoz, F.J.C.

"Ou, J.I.; Ta, C.N.",Endophthalmitis prophylaxis,"Recent publications have produced a body of evidence suggesting an increase in the prevalence of endophthalmitis caused by poor wound architecture sometimes associated with a clear cornea incision. Local risk factors, such as blepharitis, systemic risk factors, such as diabetes, and intraoperative complications, such as vitreous loss, further increase the risk of endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis prophylaxis, such as the use of povidone-iodine, has been shown to decrease the rate of endophthalmitis. The use of 5% povidone-iodine and irrigation in the fornices and use of preoperative antibiotics may decrease conjunctival bacterial load and in turn lower the rates of endophthalmitis. In addition, it may be important to apply povidone-iodine and antibiotics at the conclusion of a clear cornea cataract surgery. The role of postoperative subconjunctival antibiotic injection is not clear but has been associated with decreased ocular bacterial flora. Finally, discretion should be used with intracameral antibiotics, especially vancomycin, because data have not been clear regarding efficacy and may lead to cystoid macular edema and increased resistance of bacteria to vancomycin. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"Taşkin, F.; Akdilli, A.; Karaman, C.; Ünsal, A.; Köseoǧlu, K.; Ergin, F.",Mammographically detected breast arterial calcifications: indicators for arteriosclerotic diseases,"Purpose: To determine the prevalence of breast arterial calcifications (BAC) detected on mammography and search for conditions that may influence their existence. Materials and methods: The mammograms of 6156 consecutive patients were reevaluated for the presence of BAC. Four hundred eighty-five women having BAC were enrolled in the patient group. Additionally, randomly selected 500 women, without BAC constituted the control group. Hospital records of the participants were reviewed for parity, menopausal status, oral contraceptive agent (OCA) usage, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) usage, presence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, albuminuria and history of myocardial infarction (MI).Prevalence of BAC was 7.9% on mammograms. Ninety-four women were aged between 40 and 49 years, 165 were aged between 50 and 59 years and 226 were over 60 years among BAC positive 485 women. A significant relationship was found for the frequency of BAC versus age and HRT usage in all age groups (p 0.05). Conclusion: Most benign findings like BAC are not routinely reported during mammographic evaluation. Our study showed that, presence of BAC on mammography was strongly related to advancing age. However, these findings may signify a systemic risk and can be used as precautious indicators for undocumented systemic diseases, especially in premenopausal women. 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Adequate methodologies and models should be studied to support their decisions. In this work, an approach to evaluate the overall ""systemic"" vulnerability of a territory to extreme natural phenomena is presented. This approach is able to support decision makers in evaluating the key preventive planning actions to be exploited on a territory, taking into account both the specific possible damage that is likely to impact the different single relevant elements and the reduction in functionality of the overall territorial system caused by damage to a specific element. To achieve this goal, a graph-based approach is introduced to model the influences that each element may have on the functionality of the overall territorial system. The nodes of the graph represent all the relevant elements in the territory, whose failure or breakdown can seriously influence the functionality of the whole territorial system. The links represent the influences among the functionalities of these elements. An iterative algorithm to compute the consequent systemic vulnerability is also described.

Each bank faces fluctuations in liquid assets and stochastic investment opportunities that mature with delay, creating the risk of liquidity shortages. An interbank market lets participants pool this risk but also creates the potential for one bank's crisis to propagate through the system. We study banking systems with homogeneous banks, as well as systems in which banks are heterogeneous. With homogeneous banks, an interbank market unambiguously stabilizes the system. With heterogeneity, knock-on effects become possible, but the stabilizing role of interbank lending remains so that the interbank market can play an ambiguous role. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Simpson, J.L.; Evans, J.",Benchmarking and crosschecking international banking economic and regulatory capital,"The purpose of this paper is to provide banking regulators with another tool to crosscheck the appropriateness and consistency of levels of capital adequacy for banks. The process begins by examining banking systems and focuses on market risks and the systemic risks associated with growing global economic integration and associated systemic interdependence. The model provides benchmarks for economic and regulatory capital for international banking systems using country, regional and global stock-market generated price index returns data. The benchmarks can then be translated to crosschecking capital levels for banks within those systems. For analytical purposes systems are assumed to possess a degree of informational efficiency and credit, liquidity and operational risks are held constant or at least assumed to be covered in loan loss provisions. An empirical study is included that demonstrates how market risk and systemic risk can be accounted for in a benchmark banking system performance model. Full testing of the model is left for future research. The paper merely proposes that such an approach is feasible and useful and it is in no way intended to be a replacement for the current Basel Accord.

Methods: Retrospective non-comparative case series.Six patients with bilateral epithelial defects after LAISK were part of a cohort of 605 patients undergoing bilateral LASIK at our center from December 2001 to April 2003. The mean age of the patients (5M:1F) was 28.5 7.9 years, and the average pretreatment myopic spherical equivalent (SE) refraction was 7.3 0.7(-4, -12.25D). An epithelial flap was present ineyes and an epithelial defect with a mean diameter ofmm (2mm, 6mm) was seen ineyes. In four patients the epithelial disturbance was bilaterally similar. All defects occurred in the inferior cornea and the epithelial flaps had the hinge positioned superiorly. None of the patients had ocular or systemic risk factors that could have resulted in this complication. A bandage contact lens was used ineyes.

In the first part, the basic components of food risks are discussed and then compared with the perceptions of these risks. The main emphasis is on the risks from food packaging. The term 'perception' as used in cognitive psychology applies to the mental processes through which a person takes in, deals with and assesses information from the environment (physical and communicative) via the senses.

We hypothesized that obesity, because of biomechanical and systemic risk factors, increases the risks of rotator cuff tendinitis, tears, and related surgical procedures. Methods: A frequency-matched case-control study was conducted. Three hundred and eleven patients who were fifty-three to seventy-seven years old and who underwent rotator cuff repair, arthroscopy, and or other repair of the shoulder in a large hospital from 1992 to 2000 were included in the study. These surgical procedures were used as proxies for the risk of rotator cuff tendinitis. These patients were age and frequency-matched to 933 controls, who were randomly drawn from a pool of 10,943 potential controls consisting of Utah state residents who were enrolled in a large cancer-screening trial. Age-adjusted odds ratios were calculated with use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedural codes and body-mass-index groups. The data were stratified according to gender and age. Multiple linear regression analyses also were performed.There was an association between increasing body-mass index and shoulder repair surgery. The highest odds ratios for both men (odds ratio 3.13 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 7.61) and women (odds ratio 3.51 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 6.85) were for individuals with a body-mass index of 35.0 kg m2. Tests for trend also were highly significant for both men (p 0.002) and women (p 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis also indicated a significant association between increasing body-mass index and shoulder surgery (beta 1.57 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 2.17 0.001).There is an association between obesity and shoulder repair surgery in men and women who are fifty-three to seventy-seven years of age. The of the present study suggest that increasing body-mass index is a risk factor for rotator cuff tendinitis and related conditions. Clinical Relevance: Individuals who are obese are at increased risk for rotator cuff tendinitis and rotator cuff-related surgery. This apparent risk increases with the degree of obesity.

Although the status of autonomic nervous system is an important determinant of the systemic hemodynamic parameters, this issue is usually ignored by the clinician in the process of glaucoma diagnosis. Consequently, there is a lack of alternative therapies tailored to address associated systemic risk factors for POAG on a case and chronological basis this approach could be more effective in preventing the progression and visual loss in selected glaucoma cases. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It is recognized that hemodynamic forces are largely responsible for dictating which vascular sites are either susceptible or resistant to developing atherosclerosis. In addition, a number of systemic and local factors also modulate the pathogenesis of the disease. By studying the development of atherosclerosis in mice, investigators have gained insights into the molecular mechanisms of this disease, although studies have largely focused on a single vascular site. Here, we review those recent studies in which vascular site-specific effects on atherosclerosis were reported when more thansite was examined. We assess the hypothesis that regional differences in the hemodynamic profile prime the endothelial phenotype to respond distinctly to such systemic risk factors as hypercholesterolemia, genetics, immune status, gender, and oxidative stress. Because a given treatment may differentially affect the development of atherosclerotic lesions throughout the vasculature, the sites chosen for study are critically important.

"Beheshti, M.; Graf, S.; Pirich, C.",Myocardial perfusion imaging,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using nuclear techniques is a well established diagnostic tool in clinical cardiology providing non-invasively information about perfusion and function. Single Photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is routinely applied for MPI allowing the characterisation of localisation, extent and severity of perfusion abnormalities. Several radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced to study myocardial perfusion enabling accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The documented prognostic value of scintigraphic parameters is of clinical importance to guide decision making in the work up of the cardiac patient. Event rates associated with a normal or low-risk MPI study have been shown to be 1% year of follow-up. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of radionuclide imaging in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected CAD has been extensively demonstrated. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the most advanced scintigraphic imaging technique developed for in-vivo assessment of cardiac physiology and biochemistry. Assessing myocardial blood flow at rest and under stress conditions and calculating (regional) coronary flow reserve by N-13 ammonia, Rb-82 or O-15 water PET is the most sensitive means to detect any abnormal vasoreactivity which is already found at very early stages of the atherosclerotic process before any angiographic or clinical evidence of CAD.

Two further articles examine the challenges faced by traditional state regulation through new tasks of systemic risk management, such as facilitating law and science interactions and ensuring animal disease control. The authors share a commitment to a range of fundamental values informing regulation, such as respect for animal welfare, the protection of the health and safety of workers, visions of justice which involve redistributive values and a concern with context-sensitive, proceduralized law which operates with a reflexive awareness of its own limitations.

"Addy, M.; Martin, M.V.",Systemic antimicrobials in the treatment of chronic periodontal diseases: A dilemma,"The use of systemic antimicrobials in the treatment of acute and chronic periodontal diseases must be viewed as a dilemma. On the one hand, the approach is attractive because of the microbial nature of periodontal diseases but, on the other hand, evidence of benefit of these agents is equivocal for the majority of periodontal diseases and antimicrobials have the potential to cause harm. The disadvantages of systemic antimicrobials can be grouped under the headings of allergic reactions, superinfection, toxicity, drug interactions, patient compliance and, perhaps of most widespread importance, bacterial resistance. Mechanical debridement methods, including drainage of pus for acute periodontal abscesses, should be considered the first line treatment for most periodontal diseases. Systemic antimicrobials should be considered as adjuncts to mechanical debridement methods and, in chronic disease, never used alone as they can predispose to abscess formation. Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials may be considered in acute disease where debridement or drainage of pus is difficult, where there is local spread or systemic upset. In chronic periodontal diseases, adjunctive antimicrobials should be considered in early onset or rapidly progressive disease or in advanced chronic adult disease where mechanical therapies have failed or surgery is not a preferred option. Inadequate oral hygiene and tobacco smoking are contra-indications to the use of antimicrobials. The value of systemic antimicrobials, where other systemic risk factors co-exist, has still to be established.

Particular attention is paid to the proposed Peruvian draft law, Philippines legislation and the Organization of African Unity Model Law. However, reference is also made to the activities of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. This international perspective is considered vital on the basis that the failure to establish some minimal international regulation of indigenous and local community knowledge will be likely to undermine the effectiveness of any national systems that are developed. This systemic risk exists because the main demand for access to, and capacity to commercially developed. This systemic risk exists because the main demand for access to, and capacity to commercially develop, indigenous and local community knowledge tends to be present in states and regions other than the points of origin of that knowledge. Many of the fundamental problems in addressing the protection of indigenous and local community knowledge involve accommodating the world views according to which the holders and potential users of such knowledge conduct their daily lives. It is argued here that the current state of international debate on these questions indicates that, at least for the time being, understanding of the most basic of points is not significantly increasing.

Methods: 420 patients with hip OA and 398 patients with knee OA scheduled for unilateral total joint replacement in four hospitals in the southwestern part of Germany underwent detailed clinical investigations and a standardized interview in addition to radiographic analyses of ipsilateral and contralateral hip or knee joint and both hands. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of different possible risk factors with OA patterns (unilateral, bilateral and generalized OA) were calculated with logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.In 41.7% of patients with hip OA and 33.4% of patients with knee OA, an underlying pathological condition allowed a classification as secondary OA. 82.1% of patients with hip and 87.4% of patients with knee OA had bilateral disease. Generalized OA (GOA) was found in 19.3 and 34.9%, respectively (after adjustment for different age and sex distribution in the two patient groups however, this difference was not any more significant). A positive association could be observed between hypercholesterolemia and GOA in knee OA patients as well as between serum uric acid and GOA in hip OA patients. Obesity and overweight were associated with bilateral knee OA, but not bilateral hip OA nor GOA. Discussion: Our innovative study design allows the non-invasive investigation of patient subgroups with established disease and a testing of relevant hypotheses in an appropriate setting.

"Brevetti, G.; Annecchini, R.; Bucur, R.",Intermittent claudication: pharmacoeconomic and quality-of-life aspects of treatment,"The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the pharmacoeconomics of treatment for intermittent claudication and to discuss the importance of quality-of-life assessment for evaluating treatment strategies. Systemic risk reduction is the primary in the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication, as these patients have a high future risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Modification of cardiovascular risk factors accompanied by antiplatelet therapy is likely to improve overall survival, reduce myocardial infarction and stroke, and will, perhaps, also reduce the risk of ulcers and amputation at acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios. The second goal in the treatment of patients with intermittent claudication is to improve their walking capacity and community-based functional status. Supervised exercise training is the most effective noninvasive intervention to improve walking capacity, but may have elevated indirect costs. Among patients with disabling claudication who are candidates for invasive therapeutic procedures, angioplasty is cost effective in those with femoropopliteal stenosis or occlusion and in those with critical limb ischaemia and a stenosis. For all these therapeutic strategies there is a need to relate the costs to a relevant and comprehensive measure of effectiveness. Quality-of-life evaluation by using questionnaires exploring the specific problems encountered by patients with intermittent claudication in their daily life appear to be the most appropriate tool to evaluate the net result of a treatment. Cost-utility studies by combining pecuniary and quality-of-life evaluations provide information that is extremely useful to patients with intermittent claudication, regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare providers.",2002,2002-01-01,14,Pharmacoeconomics,acetylsalicylic acid; aged; antithrombocytic agent; atherosclerosis; beraprost; bypass surgery; cilostazol; clinical trial; clopidogrel; colestyramine; coronary artery disease; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost of illness; diet restriction; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; disease course; distress syndrome; drug efficacy; drug induced disease; drug safety; exercise; gastrointestinal toxicity; health care cost; health status; health status indicators; human; humans; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; intermittent claudication; milrinone; naftidrofuryl; nicotinic acid; pentoxifylline; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral vascular disease; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; placebo; priority journal; probucol; propionylcarnitine; prostacyclin; quality adjusted life year; quality of life; questionnaire; review; risk factor; risk factors; serotonin 2 antagonist; stent; stroke; ticlopidine; walking,"Brevetti, G.

A retrospective study in an optometry clinic was performed to determine if certain ocular findings and associated systemic risk factors were associated with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (HSCAS). Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients examined in the optometry clinic at the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999 to identify all patients who had carotid studies ordered. Charts were then reviewed to determine the ocular finding that prompted the carotid study. Statistical analysis using an odds-ratio was performed to determine whether any ocular sign symptom or systemic risk factor was associated with HSCAS.Of 3822 patients, 48 (1.26%) had carotid studies ordered. Eight (17%) had HSCAS of 50% and symptomatic patients were 1.6 times more likely to have HSCAS than asymptomatic patients. Patients with HSCAS were 1.8 times more likely to have retinal vascular occlusions, 1.9 times more likely to have normotensive glaucoma, 2.4 times more likely to have peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and 2.6 times more likely to be smokers, although none of these factors were found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS. However, the number of systemic diseases tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (HSCAS median 3.5 and the non-HSCAS median 2,0.049). Conclusion. Although no single ocular or systemic risk factor was found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS, the number of systemic disease risk factors tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (p 0.049). An extensive literature review was also performed to help establish guidelines for when to order carotid studies on the basis of ocular signs and or symptoms as well as the presence of additive associated systemic risk factors.",2002,2002-01-01,22,Optometry and Vision Science,adult; aged; amaurosis fugax; article; b scan; blood vessels; carotid artery disease; carotid artery obstruction; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; cigarette smoking; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; diseases; guidelines; hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; ocular; optometers; patient monitoring; peripheral retinal hemorrhages; peripheral vascular disease; priority journal; retina hemorrhage; retinal emboli; retrospective analysis; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; risk factors; stroke; systemic; transitional blindness; vision,"Lyons-Wait, V.A.

"De, N.G.; Kwast, M.L.",Systemic risk and financial consolidation: are they related,"The creation of a number of very large and sometimes increasingly complex financial institutions, resulting in part from the on-going consolidation of the financial system, has raised concerns that the degree of systemic risk in the financial system may have increased. We argue that firm inter-dependencies, as measured by correlations of stock returns, provide an indicator of systemic risk potential. We analyze the dynamics of the stock return correlations of a sample of US large and complex banking organizations (LCBOs) over 1988-1999, and find a significant positive trend in stock return correlations. This findings is consistent with the view that the systemic risk potential in the financial sector appears to have increased over the last decade. In addition, we relate firms' return correlations to their consolidation activity by estimating measures of the consolidation elasticity of correlation. Consolidation at the sample LCBOs appears to have contributed to LCBOs inter-dependencies. However, consolidation elasticities of correlation exhibit substantial time variation, and likely declined in the latter part of the decade. Thus, factors other than consolidation have also been responsible for the upward trend in return correlations. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Schulz, U.G.R.; Rothwell, P.M.",Major variation in carotid bifurcation anatomy: A possible risk factor for plaque development,"and PurposeWhy is carotid plaque often so strikingly asymmetrical within individuals, and why does the extent of disease vary so considerably between individuals with similar systemic risk factors Variability of carotid bifurcation anatomy is a possible explanation. Flow models suggest that vessel anatomy, in particular vessel diameter and area ratios, affects plaque formation at arterial bifurcations. However, carotid bifurcation anatomy could only be a major risk factor for plaque formation if it was sufficiently variable. Since very few data exist on the extent of interindividual and intraindividual variability of bifurcation anatomy, we studied 5395 angiograms from the European Carotid Surgery Trial. MethodsTo minimize changes in bifurcation anatomy secondary to atherosclerosis, we excluded vessels with 30% stenosis. We measured arterial diameters at disease-free points and calculated the following ratios: internal to common carotid (ICA CCA), external to common carotid (ECA CCA), external to internal carotid (ECA ICA), and outflow inflow area. For intraindividual asymmetry, we compared the ratios on both sides. Each ratio varied markedly between individuals. The 95% ranges were as follows: ICA CCA, 0.44 to 0.86 ECA CCA, 0.34 to 0.80 ECA ICA, 0.55 to 1.33 and outflow inflow area, 0.38 to 1.28. The were very similar in 407 bifurcations with no disease. Among the 755 patients with 30% stenosis bilaterally, side differences of 25% were present in 17% (95% CI, 15% to 20%) for the ICA CCA ratio, 27% (95% CI, 24% to 30%) for the ECA CCA ratio, 32% (95% CI, 28% to 35%) for the ECA ICA ratio, and 42% (95% CI, 38% to 45%) for the outflow inflow area ratio. We found large interindividual differences in carotid bifurcation anatomy. For example, there was 4-fold variation of the ratio of outflow to inflow area. Intraindividual variation was also considerable. These data highlight the potential importance of anatomic variation as a risk factor for atheroma and provide a firm basis for flow modeling studies.",2001,2001-01-01,127,Stroke,"angiography; article; atherosclerotic plaque; brain blood flow; carotid arteries; carotid arteriography; carotid artery; carotid artery bifurcation; carotid artery disease; carotid artery diseases; common carotid artery; external carotid artery; histology; human; internal carotid artery; priority journal; radiography; risk factor; risk factors; stroke; support, non-u.s. gov't","Schulz, U.G.R.

"Archie, Jr.J.P.",Reoperations for carotid artery stenosis: role of primary and secondary reconstructions,"Purpose: This is an analysis of the role of primary and secondary carotid artery reconstructions and systemic risk factors on the incidence and timing of reoperations and their perioperative and late outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively stored data. Between 1981 and 1999, 69 secondary carotid artery procedures were performed on 66 patients (3 were bilateral). Of these, 29 operations and patients came from my series of 1514 primary carotid endarterectomies (CEAs). Overall, secondary operations were performed on 37 women (1 bilateral) and 29 men (2 bilateral) with a mean age of 68 years. Indications for reoperation were transient ischemic attack in 27%, stroke in 12%, global ischemia in 9%, and asymptomatic 70% recurrent stenosis in 52%. Secondary reconstruction was by saphenous vein patching in 57% (n 39), Dacron patching in 29% (n 20), polytetrafluoroethylene patch in 1% (n 1), and interposition bypass graft in 13% (n 9). The main outcome measures included restenosis, re-restenosis, and perioperative and late stroke and death.Reoperations were more frequent after originally primarily closed CEA (6.2%) than after patched CEA (1.6%,.01). Reoperations after Dacron-patched CEA occurred at a mean of 16 months compared with a mean of 84 months for vein-patched CEA (P .001). Male sex and history of smoking have a slightly adverse but not statistically significant effect on the incidence and time of reoperation. Restenosis in the distal common carotid artery requiring reoperation had a near-linear rate of occurrence, whereas that in the internal carotid artery segment was bimodal with a higher incidence in the firstyears and afteryears. There were no (0%) 30-day perioperative deaths. There were two (2.9%) 30-day strokes (1 major,minor). Over a mean follow-up of 50 months (range, 1-180), the Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival was 74% atyears and 54% at 10 years. This is significantly higher than late death after primary CEA independent of age. The cumulative freedom from stroke rate was 90% atyears and 86% at 10 years. After secondary procedures re-recurrent stenosis 25% occurred in 25% (n 17), 50% in 13% (n 9), and 70% in 4% (n 3). There was no statistically significant difference in stroke or re-restenosis rates between vein-patched, Dacron-patched, and bypassed reoperations, although re-recurrence tended to occur earlier after Dacron-patched than vein-patched procedures. Analysis of pooled literature data and the of this study for stroke and re-restenosis outcomes by type secondary reconstruction (patch versus bypass graft) and by material (vein versus synthetic) give a balanced picture of near equality for each. Vein- and Dacron-patched arteries have similar outcomes, whereas polytetrafluoroethylene appears to be superior to vein and Dacron for interposition bypass graft.Secondary carotid artery operations are more frequent after primarily closed CEA than patched CEA. Perioperative mortality and stroke rates for reoperations are within the acceptable window of primary CEA. The incidence of late death after reoperations is higher than after primary CEA. The perioperative stroke, late stroke, and re-restenosis outcomes of vein- and Dacron-patched secondary operations are similar, as are those for patched and bypassed carotid arteries.",2001,2001-01-01,37,Journal of Vascular Surgery,adult; aged; artery reconstruction; article; carotid artery obstruction; endarterectomy; female; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; priority journal; reoperation; risk factor; stroke; surgical mortality; surgical technique; treatment indication; treatment outcome,"Archie Jr. (J.P., Carolina Cardiovascular Surgical Associates, Wake Medical Center, United States)",https://dx.doi.org/10.1067/mva.2001.111730,https://dx.doi.org/10.1067/mva.2001.111730,scopus,2-s2.0-0035099823
"Archie, J.P.; Jr., N.A.",Restenosis after carotid endarterectomy in patients with paired vein and dacron patch reconstruction,"This is an analysis of restenosis after bilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with saphenous vein patch reconstruction on one side and Dacron patch reconstruction on the other. The possibility that differences in reconstruction geometry between vein and Dacron patched sides effected restenosis outcomes was evaluated as was the value of serial common carotid wall thickness measurements in predicting restenosis. Between 1990 and 1997, 33 bilateral CEA were performed within one year on 22 men and 11 women using a greater saphenous vein patch on one side and a knitted Dacron patch on the other. Interoperative post-CEA geometry was measured. Follow-up was by duplex scans that included wall thickness measurements in the endarterectomized common carotid bulb. Over a mean follow-up of 43 months 10 (30%) Dacron patched and one (3%) vein patched CEA developed 25% restenosis (p 0.001), seven (21%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed 50% restenosis (p 0.01) and four (12%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed 70% restenosis (p 0.1 1). The Kaplan-Meier cumulative 25% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 22% and 0% atyears and 41% and 5% atyears respectively (p 0.002). The cumulative 50% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 16% and 0% atyears and 34% and 0% atyears respectively (p 0.003). The cumulative 70% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 8% and 0% atyears and 20% and 0% atyears respectively (p 0.02). For both patients with and without recurrent stenosis the mean within patient between sides differences of the diameters of the internal carotid, internal carotid bulb, common carotid bulb, and common carotid arteries and the lengths of the internal carotid and total patch segments were not significantly different and all were less than 5%. Common carotid bulb wall thickness measured at the time of identification of the nine unilateral Dacron patched CEA restenosis was 1.5 0.5 mm compared to 1.4 0.4 mm (m SD) for the contralateral vein patched CEA (p 0.45 by pairedtest). Dacron patched CEA have a significantly higher incidence of mild, moderate and severe restenosis than do saphenous vein patched CEA independent of systemic risk factors. The within patient equality of Dacron and vein patched carotid reconstruction geometry in patients with unilateral restenosis indicates that patch material is the major local risk factor, not adverse hemodynamics produced by variance in geometry. Common carotid bulb wall thickness measurements after CEA are not predictors or indicators of recurrent stenosis. 2001, Sage Publications.

"Wunder, J.S.; Healey, J.H.; Davis, A.M.; Brennan, M.F.",A comparison of staging systems for localized extremity soft tissue sarcoma,"systems for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are important to identify patients with similar systemic risk who might benefit from specific treatments. This study compared four commonly used staging systems for predicting systemic outcomes of patients with localized extremity STS, as proposed by the fourth and fifth editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer International Union Against Cancer (AICC UICC) staging system, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) system, and the Surgical Staging System (SSS) of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. METHODS. Three hundred consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic STS of the lower extremity were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 1989. Metastasis free survival was the end point of the study. The prognostic value of the four staging systems and their components were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to identify the system that best predicted the risk of systemic recurrence.Compartment status, depth, grade, and size were all independent predictors of outcome within their respective staging systems. However, when compared with one another, only depth, grade, and size retained their prognostic significance. Of the four models, the AIC predicted that the MSK was the best predictor of systemic relapse, followed by the fifth edition of the AICC UICC staging system.Staging systems such as the MSK system or the fifth edition of the AICC UICC system, which include tumor depth, grade, and size as prognostic factors, are the most predictive of systemic relapse in patients presenting with localized extremity STS. Both of these systems identify the same group of patients at the highest risk who would be the most suitable for adjuvant chemotherapy trials.

Forty-one unruptured cerebral aneurysms were found in 34 (13.9%) of 244 patients. This incidence was significantly higher than that found in a control group of healthy volunteers (6%). Furthermore, patients who had a family history of SAH combined with multiple systemic risk factors were found to have the highest incidence of unruptured aneurysms (32% odds ratio 3.49, 95% confidence interval 1.37-8.9).These findings suggest that patients with a family history of SAH with or without the presence of more than one systemic risk factor are at significantly higher risk of harboring cerebral aneurysms.

No significant influence of systemic risk factors or of the pre-existing morbidity was observed. In high risk patients or interventions, adapted procedures were performed.Risk adapted surgical treatment strategies and procedures may compensate an increased pre-existing risk of postoperative posttraumatic wound infection.",1999,1999-01-01,4,Aktuelle Traumatologie,antibiotic agent; antibiotic prophylaxis; article; disease predisposition; high risk population; human; infection rate; infection risk; lower leg; major clinical study; orthopedic surgery; postoperative infection; soft tissue injury; surgical technique,"Hansis, M.L.
