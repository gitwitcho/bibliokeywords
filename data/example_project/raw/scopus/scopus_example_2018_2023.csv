We selected 27 listed insurers from China, South Korea, Japan and Singapore, and built a double-CoVaR model based on monthly data for 2012-2021. We explored the impact mechanism by decomposing the spillover effect and conducted regression analysis to determine factors influencing net spillover. First, the banking sector has positive spillover on insurance systemic risk. Second, the banking sector affects insurance systemic risk mainly through direct risk spillover. Third, the size, asset similarity and leverage of insurers significantly impact net spillover. This paper contributes to the previous literature and regulation by providing a methodology for predicting risk spillovers using a new model and an up-to-date data. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",banking sector; double-CoVaR; insurance sector; Systemic risk,,"Hao, Y.; School of Insurance, China; email: hao_yilin@163.com",,World Scientific,02175908,,,,English,Singap.

We use a novel approach that employs a stochastic frontier model to measure Brazilian banks' mark-up and estimate the impact of prudential measures on market power. Our results suggest that the tightening of prudential measures increases banks’ mark-up and, consequently, has a negative impact on banking competition. Our finding suggests that financial regulators should consider this adverse effect when designing regulations to promote financial stability without harming competition in the banking system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bank regulation; Lerner index; Market power; Prudential measures; Stochastic frontier,,"Scalco, P.R.; Faculty of Management, Brazil; email: scalco@ufg.br",,Elsevier B.V.,02649993,,,,English,Econ.

The empirical results suggest strong linkages among industry sectors. The risk profiles of certain industries under close supply–demand relationships are positively correlated, whereas the financial industry, particularly banking, proves to be the principal risk diversifier in the network, with the household appliance, food and drink industries performing likewise an important role in risk diversification. Based on the TENQR model, further study on additional information provided by the industrial chain structure demonstrates that the upstream industry dominates the spread of risks under extreme market conditions.

Technology offers South African banks the opportunity to address inherent socio-economic imbalances in the economy. However, the potential systemic risk it poses threatens to aggravate the situation if it not properly regulated. This paper uses a non-positivist, qualitative research design - the case study approach - to argue that South African banks have adopted a measured mindset to adopting Fintech because they are fundamentally risk-averse. Structural socio-economic imbalances, legacy systems, and a banking industry that has traditionally been conservative are argued to be the main drivers of this.

This approach was caused by exacerbation of the G-SIBs’ systemic risks and their transmission during macro level instability. The size of G-SIBs, the extent of their market power, and the heterogeneity of their operating models resulted in their dual role in systemic stress: being a source of systemic risks for the macro level, G-SIBs are at the same time transmitters of crisis developments to the micro level, hence increasing their own exposure to risks. Under these circumstances, the objectives of global gross domestic product (GDP) growth required a revision of regulatory priorities by shifting them from G-SIBs’ profitability to G-SIBs’ stress resilience through the application to them of more stringent capital adequacy standards and liquidity requirements, which ultimately contributed to G-SIBs’ insusceptibility to external shocks. At the same time, the G-SIBs’ role in exacerbation of systemic stress remains uncertain due to the unresolved issues of the G-SIBs’ systemic importance. Given the high level of their interconnectedness in the international financial area, dysfunction of G-SIBs can provoke a domino effect of insolvency and bankruptcies in the international banking sector. Based on 2011–21 statistics for all G-SIBs included in the annual lists of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), we found certain decline in G-SIBs’ systemic risks, which is attributable to further strengthening of their market discipline. This proves that international regulatory policy is on the right track. We also found that the stress resilience of G-SIBs, a product of the application of Basel III capital buffers and the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) standard, significantly contributed to financial stability at a level sufficient not only for the integrity of G-SIBs’ performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also for minimization of the risk of collapse of the banking systems that prevented the transformation of the related shocks and instability into an economy-wide crisis. Nevertheless, the post-crisis regulatory reform failed to contain the systemic importance of G-SIBs, mostly due to the lack of supervisory tools and techniques in reduction of the negative effects of the G-SIBs’ international interconnectedness. © 2022, International Organisations Research Journal.

Yet the political dynamics shaping post-crisis efforts to de-financialize housing have received surprisingly little analysis. The financialization literature posits that de-financialization policies have been hampered by a policy consensus on the desirability of the pre-crisis status quo. I examine this claim through a detailed analysis of Dutch macroprudential policy reforms, which aimed to mitigate housing-related systemic risks. It finds a fragmented rather than coherent policy community, with the central bank and financial conduct authority pushing for ambitious policies. While they influenced reforms during the housing bust (2008–2013), the government ensured that these financial supervisors would remain peripheral to the future determination of these policies. As the subsequent housing market recovery reduced the urgency to reform, supervisors were unable to impose further de-financialization policies. Housing financialization thus appears self-sustaining, by making mortgage-related policies politically too important for the government to consider a significant empowerment of the actors that might challenge it. © 2022 The Author(s).

(2009), we define and construct Granger-causality tail risk networks between 33 systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and 36 sovereign bonds worldwide. Our purpose is to exploit the structure of the Granger-causality tail risk networks to identify periods of distress in financial markets and possible channels of systemic risk propagation. Combining measures of connectedness of these networks with the ratings of the sovereign bonds, we propose a flight-to-quality indicator to identify periods of turbulence in the market.

To answer this question, we analyze a comprehensive sample that combines an original set of bank-specific bailout events with the balance sheets of key affected and nonaffected European banks between 2005 and 2014. We find a positive and significant association of guarantees with systemic risk that is somewhat weaker in the long run when the regulator appoints members to the supervisory board. The short run association between recapitalizations and systemic risk is also positive for large and less capitalized banks, while in the long run, recapitalizations are linked with reduced systemic importance, especially for less profitable banks and in cases when the regulator limits management pay. Liquidity injections are positively linked with systemic risk, but the long-run effect is mitigated for small or better capitalized banks. In the short run, injecting liquidity is associated with reduced systemic risk when the regulator imposes restrictions on supervisory board composition or on management pay or capital payouts. © 2023, The Author(s).",Policy interventions; Regulatory restrictions; Risk strategies; Systemic risk,,"Ongena, S.; University of Zürich, Plattenstrasse 14, Switzerland; email: steven.ongena@bf.uzh.ch",,Springer,09208550,,,,English,J.

CAS is a consequence of systemic atherosclerotic disease affecting the majority of the aging population. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel imaging technique for visualizing retinal blood flow. It is a noninvasive, fast method for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the microcirculation. Cerebral and retinal circulation share similar anatomy, physiology, and embryology; thus, retinal microvasculature provides a unique opportunity to study the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease in vivo. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of systemic risk factors on retinal blood flow in the eyes of patients with significant carotid artery stenosis using OCT angiography. A total of 112 eyes of 56 patients with significant carotid stenosis were included in the study. We found that several systemic factors, such as decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hypertension, and carotid occlusion have a significant negative effect on retinal blood flow, while statin use and carotid surgery substantially improve ocular microcirculation. Neither diabetes, clopidogrel or acetylsalicylic acid use, BMI, serum lipid level, nor thrombocyte count showed a significant effect on ocular blood flow. Our results demonstrate that a systematic connection does exist between certain systemic risk factors and retinal blood flow in this patient population. OCTA could help in the assessment of cerebral circulation of patients with CAS due to its ability to detect subtle changes in retinal microcirculation that is considered to represent changes in intracranial blood flow. © 2021, The Author(s).",Carotid artery stenosis; OCT angiography; Retinal biomarkers; Retinal imaging,"acetylsalicylic acid; cholesterol; clopidogrel; high density lipoprotein; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; lipid; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; body mass; brain microcirculation; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery surgery; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; hypertension; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography angiography; platelet count; prospective study; retina blood flow; risk assessment; risk factor; angiography; carotid artery obstruction; diagnostic imaging; microcirculation; optical coherence tomography; procedures; retina; Aged; Angiography; Carotid Stenosis; Humans; Microcirculation; Retina; Tomography, Optical Coherence","Kovács, I.; Department of Ophthalmology, 39 Mária Street, Hungary; email: kovacsilles@yahoo.com",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,25092715,,,34837589.0,English,GeroScience,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120055128,scopus

Then takes the guarantee subject as a node and traverses the community labels of all neighbors, so as to, convert it into a guaranteed network and use the model established based on the graph neural network to rate its risk.

At the same time, depoliticization through scientific expertise was largely foreclosed, as systemic risk was a largely undefined concept. This paper focuses on how central banks dealt with this conundrum. It examines the scientific debate on systemic risk and macroprudential regulation post-crisis, focusing on the debate’s impact on final regulation. Employing author-topic-modeling on a unique dataset of 2397 published economic papers on the relevant topics, we detect the formation of a new alliance between central bankers and academic economists working jointly on developing systemic risk measures. Centered around a hinge of systemic risk contribution by individual banks, this new alliance expresses itself by incorporating the macroprudential concerns of practitioners into abstract market-based systemic risk measures.

If the borrower defaults on the loan, the risk will be diffused to its guarantors along with the contagion path, which may lead to systemic risk across the loan networks. This has brought severe challenges to the nation's financial security and regulation. Thus, accurately rating the contagion path is an urgent task for systematic risk management in the loan network. Therefore, we present a deep learning- based approach to the risk rating of contagion paths in the bank industry. We leverage the graph neural network and attention mechanism on graph-structured loan behavior to learn high-order representations, which do not require handcraft feature engineering. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing baselines with 2%∼15% improvements in risk rating and 3.5% in the newly constructed path rating problem. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which provides an effective method and theory basis for regulatory commissions and financial institutions to monitor systematic risks in networked-guarantee loans. © 2021, Science China Press.

This is due to population increase, over-consumption of water, especially in agriculture, climate change and various forms of water pollution. The issue becomes more complicated in transboundary water catchments that cover almost half of the world's land surface, with about 60% of global river flow and 40% of the world's population. Also, in many parts of the planet, like Saharan Africa, population depends on groundwater resources located in transboundary aquifer systems. These facts illustrate the importance of the book's subject, which is the governance of transboundary waters, both surface and groundwater. The book is written by two distinguished scientists, who, having worked in various international institutions, like UNESCO, GEF, UNEP and at the European Commission, have both an extended expertise on how to bridge the gap between science and political decision-making, which is the main factor for an effective governance of water resources. What is new in the book is the integrated analysis of transboundary governance of both surface water and groundwater, as it occurs in reality. In current literature, groundwater is still often missing for the benefit of surface water or, on the contrary, it is treated separately from surface water. The most important feature of the book is to distinguish between the real and a ""good"" or an effective transboundary water governance and to provide practical tools, methodologies and examples for its implementation in the field. Published timely during 2018, the book will contribute to address successfully practical problems of governance of transboundary waters that represent a very important part of our precious fresh water resources. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

As a developing country, China's banking industry plays an important role in the financial industry, and its size ranks first in the world. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the systemic risks of China's banks in the digital economy era. We first compare the traditional indicator approach and the market-based approach theoretically, and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) model, a market-based approach, is considered to be an efficient way to discover systemic risk in different perspectives. Based on static and dynamic models, we evaluate the contributions of sixteen China's listed banks to the systemic risk. Furthermore, we model bank exposures, extend the models by considering extreme circumstance, and incorporate the effects of Fintech and non-bank financial institutions. The results show the levels of systemic risks and the corresponding systemic importance rankings vary in different time periods. We find that the contributions of some small banks to systemic risk are even higher than some big banks during the sample period. Moreover, the big banks face less risks than most of the small banks when the banking system is in distress. We make suggestions for improving financial supervision and maintaining financial stability. © 2020 by the authors.",Bank; CoVaR; Digital economy era; Financial stability; Fintech; Systemic risk; Systemically important banks,,"Jiang, H.; Chinese Academy of Engineering Frontier Strategy, China; email: Jhuichen2018@buaa.edu.cn",,MDPI AG,22277390,,,,English,Mathematics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080120175,scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This research adopted a case study approach entailing the triangulation of interview data with documentary evidence on two leading West African financial service companies that have FDI footprints in over 50 country markets. Findings: Evidence suggests the primacy of market-seeking motivations in explaining the FDI activities of the explored nascent MNEs, with relationship, efficiency and mission-driven motivations emerging as strong sub-themes. Having neither the global resonance of their traditional counterparts nor the government-augmented resource profile of their Asian counterparts, the study firms appear to have shied away from costly strategic asset and prestige-seeking FDI, and preferred psychically and institutionally proximate sub-Saharan African markets and non-organic collaborative entry modes. Research limitations/implications: The above insights should be considered tentative given the study’s limited evidence base. This underscores the need for a larger scale empirical effort to assess the propositional inventory outlined at the end of this paper. Practical implications: Africa’s growing population of MNEs are urged to continue to strengthen their positions across African markets, view these regional markets as a platform to learn and upgrade their capabilities for future expansion into more challenging global markets, and to augment their limited resource profiles, including by tapping into their global diaspora networks. Policy makers should support their market-seeking initiatives given evidence that they could be a pathway to higher order FDI motivations. This evolutionary approach reflects enduring lessons from earlier generations of MNEs. Policy makers should also support continuing intra-African investment flows as a pathway to creating more sizeable, integrated African markets and generating positive spill-overs, including in typically blind-sided post-conflict or fragile African markets. This also entails pushing for cross-border regulation needed to minimise the transfer of systemic risks across countries. Originality/value: The study provides rare empirical evidence on hitherto neglected MNEs from sub-Saharan Africa, thus extending the geographic compass of research on FDI motivations. It identifies some distinctive aspects of the explored MNEs’ FDI behaviour, including the previously unheralded mission-driven motivation, whilst also revealing shared characteristics with traditional MNEs and emerging market multinational enterprisess. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Africa; EMNEs; FDI; MNEs; Motivations; Multinational enterprises,,"Ibeh, K.I.N.; Department of Management, United Kingdom; email: k.ibeh@bbk.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,02651335,,,,English,Int.

In this case-control study, the levels of AGE, sRAGE and esRAGE were measured in the blood samples and corneocytes of 29 adult patients with AD and 12 healthy controls by ELISA. Corneocyte AGE levels increased in the AD group (P =.002). Higher corneocyte AGE levels were observed in the severe AD than in the milder form of AD. No significant difference in serum AGE level was observed in patients with AD and healthy controls. Serum sRAGE markedly decreased in patients with AD (P =.007) and serum esRAGE followed a similar trend. In conclusion, dermal accumulation of AGE in AD may have a role in fuelling skin inflammation.

Positive changes in pltd increase the level of systemic risk in the economy and also trigger lower bank returns and cash flows up to horizons of one year. To disentangle the effect our credit variable has on future bank returns we break down the total variance into individual components and estimate series for news of discount-rates and cash flows.

To better understand the potential effectiveness of a macro-prudential time varying tax/subsidy on debt/dividends, we empirically estimate the impact of an Islamic financing presence on financial crises. Adherence to Islamic financing principles for a nontrivial portion of a country’s population has similar impacts to a macro-prudential policy in that these limited asset holders are likely to hold less debt or use debt-like instruments rather than conventional debt, driving down their marginal rate of substitution and the price of equity in equilibrium. To empirically estimate the effects of this policy, we interact an Islamic financing variable with debt in an otherwise standard model of financial crises. The results show that this macro-prudential-like policy decreases the likelihood of a banking crisis by 50%. The contribution of the article is twofold.

We analyse how bank stock returns during January–March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default. © 2022 The Author(s)",Bank resilience; Bank stock returns; Covid-19; Macroprudential policy,,"Mirzaei, A.; Finance Department, PO Box 26666, United Arab Emirates; email: amirzaei@aus.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

While establishing interdependencies among economic agents is crucial for the production of complex products, they may also increase systemic risk due to failure propagation. It is crucial to identify how network connectivity impacts both the emergent production and risk of collapse of economic systems. In this paper we propose a model to study the effects of network structure on the behavior of economic systems by varying the density and centralization of connections among agents. The complexity of production increases with connectivity given the combinatorial explosion of parts and products. Emergent systemic risks arise when interconnections increase vulnerabilities. Our results suggest a universal description of economic collapse given in the emergence of tipping points and phase transitions in the relationship between network structure and risk of individual failure. This relationship seems to follow a sigmoidal form in the case of increasingly denser or centralized networks. The model sheds new light on the relevance of policies for the growth of economic complexity, and highlights the trade-off between increasing the potential production of the system and its robustness to collapse. We discuss the policy implications of intervening in the organization of interconnections and system features, and stress how different network structures and node characteristics suggest different directions in order to promote complex and robust economic systems. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Economic complexity; Network topology; Systemic risk,,"Morales, A.J.; New England Complex Systems Institute, 277 Broadway, United States; email: alfredo@necsi.edu",,Springer,09277099,,,,English,Comput.

Despite the obvious benefits of shifting the burden of resolution from taxpayers to bank creditors, bank bail-ins may also give rise to costs as the financial consequences for bank shareholders and creditors being bailed in could endanger their own financial situation and potentially entail systemic implications. Using granular data on the securities cross-holdings among the largest euro area banking groups, we construct a multi-layered network model where each layer represents bail-inable securities of a specific seniority layer of the creditor hierarchy. The model can be a useful tool for resolution authorities to inform the policy discussion on both the composition and level of loss absorbing capacity of banks and the direct contagion risk following a bail-in. We find that due to low levels of securities cross-holdings in the interbank network there is no direct contagion in terms of creditor banks failing as a result of another bank being bailed in. At the same time, we document that a bail-in will have pecuniary consequences on the different liability holders and our framework allows for an exact quantification of those effects. In addition, we show that recapitalisations following a bail-in will change the network structure and hence the embedded contagion risk. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bail-in; C63; Financial networks; G01; G18; G21; Policy simulation; Resolution regimes; Systemic risk,,"Hüser, A.-C.; Goethe University Frankfurt & Bundesbank Research CentreGermany; email: annecaroline.hueser@gmail.com",,Elsevier B.V.,15723089,,,,English,J.

In South Africa this is particularly important, given a challenging socio-economic environment with high levels of unemployment and poor levels of economic growth. This paper investigates the short- and long-run determinants of bank lending behaviour for South African banks. Design/methodology/approach: The study design uses time-series data in an autoregressive distributed-lagged model for the period 1994–2016. Findings: The results indicate that factors such as the volume of deposits and the size of a bank are central to explaining bank lending behaviour in the short run, whereas GDP was found to be the only factor explaining lending behaviour in the long run. Originality/value: The results suggest that the regulatory role of the South African Reserve Bank to ensure financial stability instils trust and certainty in the banking industry and is reflected in the short-run implications to ensure that large banks are stable and depositors avoid a run on a bank's deposits. This is particularly relevant if the long-run trajectory of the economy is one of sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, although the reserve bank is constantly under threat of not having a pro-growth policy agenda, the results support its role to promote confidence and trust through its financial stability policy. Should confidence in the financisal system not be present, it is argued that systemic risk will be exacerbated through the potential failure of large banks and depositors withdrawing their funds through a run on the bank in the short run. Where financial stability is present, market participants will be more inclined to make deposits into the large South African banks, given the trust and certainty within the system. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",ARDL; Banks; Lending behaviour; South Africa,,"Coetzee, J.; Department of Economics and Finance, South Africa; email: coetzj@ufs.ac.za",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,20400705,,,,English,Afr.

This paper analyzes the impact of the Fed's balance sheet size on stock market performance. Design/methodology/approach: To analyze the Fed's balance sheet size's long-term stock market implications, this paper uses the asset pricing framework of market return predictability such as Ordinary least squares (OLS) and Generalized method of moments (GMM) analysis. Findings: Findings in this paper suggest that the Fed's balance sheet size, deflated by asset market wealth, presents evidence of return predictability during 1926–2015 that is robust against standard controls. These results can be explained through the redistribution of risk and the wealth channels of monetary policy transmission. The changing balance sheet size of a central bank (1) affects systemic risk, yields and expectations and (2) signals the future direction of monetary policy and thus economic outlook. Research limitations/implications: The main implication of these findings is that policymakers should avoid a severe imbalance between a central bank's balance sheet size and assets market wealth. Originality/value: The empirical evidence in this paper documents a century-old relation between the Fed's balance sheet size and US stock market return using the Fed's balance sheet data for the last 100 years and stock market returns from the Center for research in security prices (CRSP) database. © 2021, Asif M.

Over the past few decades, complex financial markets have often been represented as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are stocks, connected by edges that signify the correlation strengths. However, we often have interactions that occur in groups of three or more nodes, and these cannot be described simply by pairwise interactions but we also need to take the relations between these interactions into account. Only recently, researchers have started devoting attention to the higher-order architecture of complex financial systems, that can significantly enhance our ability to estimate systemic risk as well as measure the robustness of financial systems in terms of market efficiency. Geometry-inspired network measures, such as the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature, can be used to capture the network fragility and continuously monitor financial dynamics. Here, we explore the utility of such discrete Ricci curvatures in characterizing the structure of financial systems, and further, evaluate them as generic indicators of the market instability. For this purpose, we examine the daily returns from a set of stocks comprising the USA S&P-500 and the Japanese Nikkei-225 over a 32-year period, and monitor the changes in the edge-centric network curvatures. We find that the different geometric measures capture well the system-level features of the market and hence we can distinguish between the normal or 'business-as-usual' periods and all the major market crashes. This can be very useful in strategic designing of financial systems and regulating the markets in order to tackle financial instabilities. © 2021 The Authors.",financial network; geometry; networks; Ricci curvature; stock market,,"Samal, A.; The Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc)India; email: asamal@imsc.res.in

We have studied the stability of Islamic finance by analyzing the main stylized facts widely known in conventional financial markets which are: heteroscedasticity and financial contagion. Two Islamic stock indexes have been the subject of this paper, namely: the Jakarta Islamic index and the S&P Sharia index. Univariate and asymmetric GARCH models with different densities are used to model conditional volatility, while Multivariate GARCH models are used to model volatility transmission. We have proved that Islamic stock indexes have shown significant volatility, especially in times of crisis. Furthermore, the volatility transmission was very important from American market to Islamic markets. Despite its specific properties especially intrinsic stability, Islamic finance operates in an interdependent global economy and in a very risky environment. Consequently, the operators of Islamic finance must certainly strengthen the preventive management of systemic risks to consolidate the stability of Islamic finance. © 2021.

Using this measure, we develop an integrated stress test of bank liquidity and solvency risks based on the dynamics of financial distress within the banking system network. We apply this stress test framework to the US banking system and identify systemic vulnerability of individual banks as well as the resilience of the system as a whole to an economic shock. The framework helps us identify and monitor systemic interdependencies between banks.

We find that CoVaR and SRISK meet the SIFI ranking challenge. That is, they help identify systemic institutions in periods of distress beyond what is explained by standard risk measures up to six months before panics.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a panel data set of 129 commercial banks operating in 14 African countries over the period 2004–2014, this paper estimates the system generalized method of moments regression to examine the impact of business cycle on banks’ regulatory capital buffers and attempts to identify the influence of bank revenue diversification, market power and cost of funding (CF) on bank regulatory capital buffers. It further carries out some robustness analyses using a panel data set of 257 commercial banks in 23 African countries over the period 2004–2014. Findings: The results show that higher regulatory capital buffers are associated with higher market power, higher revenue diversification and higher CF. Additionally, the results show significant evidence of procyclical behavior of bank capital buffers (BUFs) in the sampled countries. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest that African banking systems are not exposed to contagion and systemic risks arising from countercyclical movements of BUFs to the real economy. Therefore, this study does not support the implementation of the Basel III CCB requirement in the sampled African countries. Originality/value: Considering that the results of existing studies on the cyclical behavior of BUFs are inconclusive, there is value in studying the cyclical movements of bank regulatory capital buffers in a set of countries that has not been analyzed before. Toward this direction, this is the first empirical study focusing on the cyclical behavior of bank regulatory capital buffers in Africa. Besides examining the cyclical behavior of bank regulatory capital buffers, this paper further investigates the effects of bank revenue diversification, market power and CF on bank regulatory capital buffers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Capital buffers; Cost of funding; Cyclicality; Diversification; Market power,,"Adesina, K.S.; School of Economics, South Africa; email: mastersunny4study@yahoo.com",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,01443585,,,,English,J.

Aim: To describe the epidemiology, diagnosis and initial treatment of nocardiosis in an Australian tertiary hospital over 7 years. Methods: In this retrospective study, all positive cultures for Nocardia species from any site isolated at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 were identified, and corresponding laboratory data and medical records reviewed. Results: Sixty-eight non-duplicate isolates were identified from 67 patients. Common predisposing factors were chronic lung disease (38/67; 57%), organ, particularly lung, transplantation (13/67; 19%) and solid organ malignancy (6/67; 9%); 12% (8/67) of patients had no identifiable systemic risk factors. Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had pulmonary nocardiosis only. Nocardia nova was the most commonly isolated species (20/68; 29%). In 48% (32/67) of patients, Nocardia species were isolated only on specific mycobacterial media. All tested species were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and amikacin, with the majority (58/63; 92%) susceptible to imipenem. All-cause mortality rates at 6 and 12 months where data were available were 15% (10/66 patients) and 22% (14/64 patients) respectively. Conclusion: In the largest Australian series in 25 years, nocardiosis predominantly affected patients with chronic lung disease or impaired cell-mediated immunity. A significant proportion of organisms from pulmonary sites were isolated on mycobacterial culture media only, suggesting that its use may improve yield. Isolates remain highly susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, amikacin and imipenem, while other agents should be used only after confirmation of in vitro susceptibility. © 2018 Royal Australasian College of Physicians",Australia; epidemiology; Nocardia; Nocardial infection; therapeutic,"amikacin; cotrimoxazole; antiinfective agent; cotrimoxazole; adolescent; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Australia; Australian; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; chronic lung disease; disease predisposition; drug sensitivity; female; human; lung transplantation; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medical record review; mortality rate; Nocardia; nocardiosis; nonhuman; personal experience; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; tertiary care center; complication; lung disease; microbiology; middle aged; neoplasm; nocardiosis; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Australia; Female; Humans; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Nocardia; Nocardia Infections; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tertiary Care Centers; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination; Young Adult","Paige, E.K.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Australia; email: e.paige@alfred.org.au",,Blackwell Publishing,14440903,,IMJNA,30091232.0,English,Intern.

Methods A total of 178 POAG patients (89 eyes showing at least 3 occurrences of DH and 89 age-matched control eyes with a minimum of 10 years’ follow-up without DH) were included in a retrospective, case-control study. Ocular factors were evaluated by a retrospective chart review, and systemic factors were evaluated by a telephone survey. Associations between factors and recurrent DH were investigated by logistic regression analysis. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to evaluate glaucoma progression and to identify the factors predictive of glaucoma progression. Results Univariate regression analysis revealed the association of recurrent DH with low baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) [odds ratio (OR), 0.88; 95% confidential interval (CI), 0.80–0.98; P = 0.014], lower percentage reduction of IOP (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99; P = 0.020), cold extremities (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.03–7.60; P = 0.043), prone or lateral decubitus sleeping position (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.13–4.03; P = 0.019), and sleeping disorders (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.05–5.15; P = 0.037). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a lower percentage reduction in IOP (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–1.00; P = 0.046) increased the risk of recurrent DH. The control group exhibited a greater cumulative probability of non-progression than the recurrent DH group (P = 0.01, by log-rank test). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed that recurrent DH was associated with glaucoma progression [hazard ratio (HR), 1.88; 95% CI; 1.66–3.05; P = 0.01. Conclusions Among the ocular and systemic factors, only lower-percentage reduction of IOP in POAG was associated with recurrent DH. DH recurrence is associated with glaucoma progression and may be dependent on IOP. © 2019 Seol et al.

New AI algorithms are constantly emerging, with each 'strain' mimicking a new form of human learning, reasoning, knowledge, and decisionmaking. The current main disrupting forms of learning include Deep Learning, Adversarial Learning, Transfer and Meta Learning. Albeit these modes of learning have been in the AI/ML field more than a decade, they now are more applicable due to the availability of data, computing power and infrastructure. These forms of learning have produced new models (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory, Generative Adversarial Networks) and leverage important applications (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Adversarial Examples, Deep Fakes, etc.). These new models and applications will drive changes in future Capital Markets, so it is important to understand their computational strengths and weaknesses. Since ML algorithms effectively self-program and evolve dynamically, financial institutions and regulators are becoming increasingly concerned with ensuring there remains a modicum of human control, focusing on Algorithmic Interpretability/Explainability, Robustness and Legality. For example, the concern is that, in the future, an ecology of trading algorithms across different institutions may 'conspire' and become unintentionally fraudulent (cf. LIBOR) or subject to subversion through compromised datasets (e.g. Microsoft Tay). New and unique forms of systemic risks can emerge, potentially coming from excessive algorithmic complexity. The contribution of this paper is to review AI, ML and associated algorithms, their computational strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future impact on the Capital Markets. © 2020 ACM.",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Finance; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Transfer learning,Commerce; Computational complexity; Deep learning; Digital storage; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Parallel processing systems; 'current; Adversarial learning; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Deep learning; Human decision-making; Human learning; Human reasoning; Machine-learning; New forms; Transfer learning; Generative adversarial networks,"Koshiyama, A.; Department of Computer Science, United Kingdom; email: a.koshiyama@cs.ucl.ac.uk",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450375849,,,English,ICAIF - ACM Int.

Concerns about potential (systemic) risks resulting from overdependence on global supply networks have been magnified during the lockdowns triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last year. Strengthening local and/or domestic networks may be an adequate approach to overcome the severe economic implications of this overdependence, but it also rises the question of how one can measure the strength of domestic supply/production networks and design an appropriate structure. The objective of this paper is to propose a method for measurement and to provide a first-cut analysis with this method on a sample of economies. Building on ecological network analysis, we borrow the Finn cycling index from its toolbox and show a ranking of countries with respect to the strength of their domestic production networks based on this index. The results suggest that the countries are very heterogeneous both in terms of the level of cycling index and its sectoral decomposition. Using panel-econometric techniques, we point out the role of the openness and structural asymmetry in shaping this strength, also controlling for other macroeconomic characteristics of the economies.

Surprisingly, post-crisis reforms have hardly addressed the underlying problems, including rating agencies’ methodologies, their ratings’ homogeneity, and widespread market reliance on these signals. Current scholarship on CRA regulation blames policymakers’ unwillingness to fix systemic problems. This article draws on insights from the social studies of finance literature to provide a different explanation: the key obstacle is policymakers’ inability to fix these problems. The regulatory problem stems from performativity: risk assessments (including ratings) shape the risks they purport to merely describe. Adding to this literature, the article spells out how performativity limits credit rating reforms by making sweeping changes potentially harmful. Standardizing methodologies or setting up a public CRA could reinforce ratings’ homogeneity. Replacing ratings in regulation with market-based indicators might create worse systemic problems. The article then empirically details how EU policymakers, confronted with these dilemmas, ultimately steered clear of bold reforms. © The Author(s)",Credit rating agencies; financial crisis; performativity; procyclicality; regulation; systemic risk,,"Stellinga, B.; Department of Political Science, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, Netherlands; email: b.j.p.stellinga@uva.nl",,University of Edinburgh,20595999,,,,English,Finance.

This process worked well for several decades, but it has since atrophied, producing numerous too big to fail banks. This Article contends that regulators' current approach to evaluating bank merger proposals is poorly suited for modem financial markets. Policymakers and scholars have traditionally focused on a single issue: Whether a bank merger would reduce competition. Over the past two decades, however, changes in bank regulation and market structure-including the repeal of interstate banking restrictions and the emergence of nonbank financial service providers-have rendered bank antitrust analysis largely obsolete. As a result, regulators have rubber-stamped recent bank mergers, despite evidence that such deals could harm consumers and destabilize financial markets. This Article asserts that contemporary bank merger analysis should instead emphasize statutory factors that regulators have long neglected: ▪whether a proposed merger would increase systemic risks, enhance the public welfare, and strengthen the relevant institutions. This Article urges regulators to modernize their approach, and it proposes a novel framework to ensure that bank merger oversight safeguards the financial system. The proposals contained herein have far-reaching implications not only for bank regulation but also for the ongoing debate over merger policy in technology, agriculture, and other industries. © 2020 Yale Journal on Regulation.

Our analysis considers the feedback behavior that exists between the financial and real sectors through a micro-level financial accelerator. We find a strong “network effect” in which the network structure can either attenuate or amplify shocks from the real sector and thus plays a major role in contagion processes. We also find that government-owned banks are the most susceptible banks to receiving shocks from firms of any economic sector. There is empirical evidence to support the claim that more diversified portfolios of banks contribute to higher sector riskiness levels. Our results suggest that systemic risk models should account for the interconnectedness among economic agents—such as the interbank and real and financial sector linkages—in a multilayer approach.

It describes some of the complexities of our contemporary situation. Conceptualising the global is now at the heart of many of current problems and challenges, not least of which is safety. When confronting safety with the category of the global over the past 30 years from the point of view of large scale threats, one can differentiate three consecutive conceptualisations of types of risks for the purposes of the essay: socio-technological risks (1), systemic risks (2) and existential risks (3). These risk types, in turn, can be associated historically with the concepts of high-risk systems (1′), globalisation (2′), and the anthropocene and transhumanism (3′). The categories overlap and do not historically replace each other but are embedded in a nested hierarchy of issues. For each successive type of risk, the notion of the global expends into three different meanings, moving (in terms to be defined) from the technosocio-sphere (global1), to what can be termed the bio-eco-geo-techno-socio sphere (global2) and finally, to the novel and emerging amalgam, a cosmo-bio-eco-geo-techno-socio2 sphere (global3). It is argued that our vision of societal safety must be understood through an appreciation of how these three different layers of issues of the global are interwoven, how this global challenges the management and governance of safety, and why in this light our contemporary situation is now one of generalised complexity. © 2017",,Spheres; Current problems; Different layers; Global challenges; High-risk systems; Nested hierarchy; Systemic risks; Technological risk; Transhumanism; Safety engineering; Article; conceptual framework; disaster; geological time; global change; global safety; human; humanism; life threat; occupational safety; priority journal; public policy; risk assessment; risk management; safety; social belief; societal safety; socioeconomics; technology,,,Elsevier B.V.,09257535,,SSCIE,,English,Saf.

With this research, we demonstrate how the methodology can be applied from banks to any company or industry sector. Then, we compare the methods for managing accounts in financial institutions and also identifying their adaptability to any type of corporation. We also made a comparison between the management elements used in financial markets and organizations assets, verifying their adaptability level.

The economic and social costs of the GFC have renewed the commitment of stakeholders in the financial sector including central banks to develop instruments and methodologies that will be useful in monitoring financial stress within the financial system and the real economy. This study contributes to the growing literature by developing a financial stress indicator for the South African financial market. The financial stress indicator (FSI) is a single aggregate indicator that is constructed to reflect the systemic nature of financial instability and also to measure the vulnerability of the financial system to both internal and external shocks. Using the principal component analysis (PCA), the results show that financial stress can be identified by the financial stress indicator. Furthermore, using a recursive Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to estimate the impact of financial stress on output and investment, the result shows that financial stress has a negative impact on economic growth and investment, though not immediately. FSI is very useful for gauging the effectiveness of government measures to mitigate the impact of financial stress. Concerted effort to stimulate investment and domestic production by relevant stakeholders is necessary to mitigate the impact of financial stress. This will go a long way to alleviating the impact of the financial stress on industrial production, employment and the economy at large. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This instability is exacerbated by diversification requirements. As the CLO market grows, each CLO's effort to diversify its portfolio leads to similarity in loan holdings among CLOs, and thus their leverage constraints simultaneously bind.

Granger causality in tail (or in risk) tests whether past extreme events of a time series help predicting future extreme events of another time series. The topology and connectedness of networks built with Granger causality in tail can be used to measure systemic risk and to identify risk transmitters. Here we introduce a novel test of Granger causality in tail which adopts the likelihood ratio statistic and is based on the multivariate generalization of a discrete autoregressive process for binary time series describing the sequence of extreme events of the underlying price dynamics. The proposed test has very good size and power in finite samples, especially for large sample size, allows inferring the correct time scale at which the causal interaction takes place, and it is flexible enough for multivariate extension when more than two time series are considered in order to decrease false detections as spurious effect of neglected variables. An extensive simulation study shows the performances of the proposed method with a large variety of data generating processes and it introduces also the comparison with the test of Granger causality in tail by Hong et al. (2009). We report both advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches, pointing out some crucial aspects related to the false detections of Granger causality for tail events. An empirical application to high frequency data of a portfolio of US stocks highlights the merits of our novel approach. © 2020",Autoregressive processes; Financial contagion; Granger causality in risk; Likelihood-ratio test; Spillover effects,,"Mazzarisi, P.; Scuola Normale Superiore, Piazza dei Cavalieri, 7, Italy; email: piero.mazzarisi@sns.it",,Elsevier B.V.,01651889,,JEDCD,,English,J.

Recent relevant studies demonstrated the need to quantify the resilience of city infrastructure networks following failures of one/some of their main components, considering both topological and operational network measures. Subsequently, focusing on robustness (a key resilience attribute) and on transit (a major critical infrastructure network), the current study develops a related quantification tool employing a hybrid approach that integrates complex network theoretic measures with data analytics, and specifically clustering and genetic algorithms. To demonstrate the practical utility of the developed tool, the robustness of the City of Minneapolis bus transit network is quantified under possible cascade failures represented by node (i.e., bus stop), link (i.e., route segment), and route failure scenarios. The robustness quantification of this transit network is facilitated by analyzing 43 topological and operational measures using a coupled map lattice model integrated with a direction-based passenger flow redistribution model. Absorptive capacity thresholds are subsequently identified under different passenger flow-to-route capacity ratios. Finally, the routes are categorized based on their influences on the network robustness using genetic algorithms coupled with K-means clustering. The developed approach aims at providing a better understanding of transit systems pre-and postdisruptions by identifying key components that control the network robustness and subsequently devising reliable systemic risk management strategies and recovery plans. Such strategies and plans are expected to facilitate city resilience planning through management of cascade failure risks attributed to natural and anthropogenic hazard events. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",Absorptive capacity; Cascade failure; City networks; Cluster analysis; Complex network theory; Genetic algorithms; Network topology; Resilience; Robustness; Transit systems,Cluster analysis; Complex networks; Critical infrastructures; Data Analytics; Genetic algorithms; Hazards; K-means clustering; Risk assessment; Risk management; Absorptive capacity; Cascade failure; City network; Complex network theory; Infrastructure networks; Network topology; Resilience; Robustness; Systemic risks; Transit systems; Network topology; anthropogenic source; cluster analysis; genetic algorithm; network analysis; topology; transportation planning; transportation system; urban transport; Minneapolis; Minnesota; United States,"Ezzeldin, M.; Dept. of Civil Engineering, Canada; email: ezzeldms@mcmaster.ca",,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),24732907,,,,English,J Transp Eng Part A Syst,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136922854,scopus

Although central clearing has been widely implemented, it has reproduced many of the same characteristics of financial markets that contributed to the 2008 crisis: concentrated risk, moral hazard, and a reliance on faulty risk models. What accounts for the recalcitrance of the OTC derivatives market to a regulatory change? The chapter argues that focusing on the technologies and practices used to govern derivatives markets helps explain the absence of more radical regulatory policy shifts in derivatives regulation. Although there has been a significant shift in who regulates OTC markets, much less has changed at the level of the specific practices that govern these markets, and the chapter examines the continued reliance on netting, collateralization, and risk modeling within clearinghouses. © Oxford University Press 2018.

In order to ensure equal protection to depositors in all European Union countries, the European Commission presented the common European Union risk-based deposit insurance system model in 2015. In this model, the individual risk of each bank should be measured. However, there are discussions in scientific literature that the amount of systemic risk of the banks should be measured. In the current economy it is very important to measure the arising amount of systemic risk in the banking sector, but even the new E.U. common deposit insurance system model of 2015 does not take systemic risk assessment into account. The aim of the research is to evaluate the risk-based common European deposit insurance system impact on deposit insurance premiums to Lithuanian banks: not only individual banks’ risks, but the systemic risk as well. The most appropriate systemic risk assessment method was selected according to different scientific researchers and strong Lithuanian banking sector concentration. The results showed that inclusion of the systemic risk assessment in risk-based deposit insurance system helps to have more accurate bank risk assessment. © 2018 The Author(s).",Deposit insurance; Riskbased; Systemic risk,banking; European Commission; European Union; financial crisis; insurance system; risk assessment; Lithuania,"Lakstutiene, A.; School of Economics and Business, Lithuania; email: aida.barkauskaite@ktu.edu",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,1331677X,,,,English,Economic Res.

Conventional risks can be contained in space and time, follow linear cause–effect relationships and can be addressed with effective and pointed interventions into the cause–effect chain. Systemic risks, however, are characterized by high complexity, transboundary effects, stochastic relationships, nonlinear cause–effect patterns with tipping points, and are often associated with less public attention than they require. The article addresses the reasons why systemic risks seem to be attenuated in public perception. The article goes on to consider how the social amplification of risk framework is useful in the context of systemic risks and describes needed extensions of that framework. It identifies practical tools for assessing the significance of perceptions for systemic risk situations.

We highlight several key observations: there are significant spatial spillover effects in global stock markets; volatility spillover network exists aggregation effects, hierarchical structure and dynamic evolution features; the risk contagion capability of traditional financial power countries falls, while that of “financial small countries” rises; stock market volatility, government debt and inflation are positively correlated with systemic risk, while current account and macroeconomic performance are negatively correlated; the indirect spillover effects of all explanatory variables on systemic risk are greater than the direct spillover effects. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",GARCH-BEKK model; Risk contagion; Spatial Durbin model; Spatial spillover; Volatility network,,"Zhuang, X.; School of Business Administration, No.195, Innovation Road, Hunnan New District, China; email: xtzhuang@mail.neu.edu.cn",,Elsevier Inc.,10629408,,,,English,North Am.

In this paper we propose a theoretical approach to bring to light the relation between connectedness and diversification. Starting from the respective axiomatic definitions, we prove that a class of proper measures of connectedness verifies, after a suitable functional transformation, the axiomatic requirements for a measure of diversification. The core idea of the paper is that connectedness and diversification are so deeply related that it is possible to pass from one concept to the other. In order to exploit such correspondence, we introduce a function, depending on the classical notion of rank of a matrix, that transforms a suitable proper measure of connectedness in a measure of diversification. We point out general properties of the proposed transformation function and apply it to a selection of measures of connectedness, such as the well-known Variance Inflation Factor. © 2021, The Author(s).",C60; Connectedness; D81; Diversification; E30; G01; G10; G11; Portfolio risk; Systemic risk,,"Torrente, M.-L.; Dipartimento di Economia, Via Vivaldi 5, Italy; email: marialura.torrente@economia.unige.it",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18629679,,,,English,Math.

In 2014, the European institutions established the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) to pursue the objective of financial stability. The new institutional arrangement contemplates a micro-prudential policy under the direct control of the European central bank (ECB), a macro-prudential policy under the responsibility of National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the supervision of the ECB. The chapter presents a survey and a simple analytical model to assess this new institutional design. Despite a still incomplete reform process, as the decision-making process lacks total transparency and the regulatory field is not levelled, the survey supports the view that the SSM promotes financial stability in the Euro area. According to the model presented, the new institutional framework is positively assessed: an increase in the efficiency of prudential policies to face financial risks allows the ECB to pursue the objective of financial stability without compromising output stability. As highlighted by Carlo Panico, this occurred in the Mexican economy, where the process of financial liberalisation promoted a rise in systemic risk, and the monetary policy aimed at financial stability generated lower growth. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, John Eatwell, Pasquale Commendatore and Neri Salvadori; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,Taylor and Francis,,9781000605914; 9780367615703,,,English,"Classical Economics, Keynes and Money: Essays in Honour of Carlo Panico",Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142096572,scopus

This inherent relationship is the object of theoretical models testing for balance-sheet vulnerabilities. In this sense, we aim to analyze whether systemic risk for a sample of US banks can be explained by a series of balance-sheet variables, considered as proxies for bank liquidity for the 2004:1-2019:1 period. We first compute Marginal Expected Shortfall values for the entities in our sample and then imbed them into a Random Forest regression setup. Although we discover that feature importance is rather bank-specific, we notice that cash and available-for-sale securities are the most relevant factors in explaining the dynamics of systemic risk. Our findings emphasize the need for heightened prudential regulation of bank liquidity, particularly in what concerns cash and immediate liquidity instrument weights. Moreover, systemic risk could be consistently tamed by consolidating bank emergency liquidity provision schemes. © 2020 by the author.

As proxy for financial stress, we reconstruct the financial stress index (FSI) for 16 advanced economies and 15 emerging economies from January 1997 to August 2020. The constructed FSIs reflect combined stress level in banking sectors, equity markets, capital markets and exchange rate markets. Using frameworks proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (Better to give than to receive: Predictive directional measurement of volatility spillovers. International Journal of Forecasting, 28(1), 57-66) and Baruník and Křehlík (Measuring the frequency dynamics of financial connectedness and systemic risk.

Moreover, the connectedness of the financial stress is stronger after the global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the spillover of shocks is strongest in the short-term horizon, the spillovers in the longer-term horizons are not trivial. Our results also show that the US is the largest shock transmitter as well as one of the largest shock receivers. Our results also suggest that shocks originating in advanced economies have strong effects on other economies, but shocks originating in emerging economies also play an increasing role.

As the king of commodities, changes in the price of gold significantly impact the economic development of various countries. Especially in the early stages of the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine, the price of gold futures has been greatly impacted, and the systemic risks are gradually spreading. In this paper, a gold future price series is mapped into a visibility graph (VG), the characteristics of the gold price time series and key points-in-Time, have been explored from the perspective of complex network. First, according to the data structure characteristics of gold futures, this paper converts the closing prices of gold futures of the New York Mercantile Exchange into a complex network through the VG model. Then, by using the complex network model to further delve into the price of gold futures, it is found that the degree distribution of the gold futures network follows a power-law distribution, and has obvious scale-free characteristics. Finally, this paper uses the visual network node shrinking algorithm and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) analysis method to identify the key nodes of the gold futures visual map to find the key time nodes in the timeline of gold futures market. Analysis of the key time nodes of this market by four methods reveals that the repetition rate of the key time nodes in the methods' top 10 ranking is as high as 82.5%, indicating that the results obtained in this paper are robust. This study introduces a new model to describe the characteristics of gold futures price series, one which can find key time nodes in gold futures prices and provide potential help for predicting gold futures prices. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",gold futures; network node shrinking algorithm; TOPSIS; Visibility graph,,"Wang, L.; College of Economics and Management, China; email: wanglubing1014@163.com",,World Scientific,02194775,,,,English,Fluctuation Noise Lett.,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149215821,scopus

In the framework of the DebtRank algorithm, we introduce an approximate method of systemic risk evaluation which requires only node properties, such as total assets and liabilities, as inputs. We demonstrate that this approximation captures a large portion of systemic risk measured by DebtRank. Furthermore, using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate network structures that can amplify systemic risk. Indeed, while no topology in general sense is a priori more stable if the market is liquid (i.e., the price of transaction creation is small) [T. Roukny et al., Sci. Rep. 3, 2759 (2013)10.1038/srep02759], a larger complexity is detrimental for the overall stability [M. Bardoscia et al., Nat. Commun. 8, 14416 (2017)10.1038/ncomms14416]. Here we find that the measure of scalar assortativity correlates well with level of systemic risk. In particular, network structures with high systemic risk are scalar assortative, meaning that risky banks are mostly exposed to other risky banks. Network structures with low systemic risk are scalar disassortative, with interactions of risky banks with stable banks. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,Monte Carlo methods; Approximate methods; Exposed to; Financial institution; In networks; Network structures; Overall stabilities; Systemic risks; Risk assessment; article; assortativity; Monte Carlo method; price; risk assessment,,,American Physical Society,24700045,,,34005874.0,English,Phys.

To explore the foreseeable and hidden systemic risks in the trade network, the article integrates virus transmission theory with complex network theory to analyze the mechanism of risk transmission in the trade network system of the lithium industry chain. This paper constructs multi-layer risk transmission networks (MRTN) based on the lithium industry chain to simulate the dynamic process of risk transmission along the industrial chain and evaluate the extent and path of risk transmission. The results show that the risk transmission in the lithium trade network system belongs to “minority communication” and is of a “robust-yet-fragile” characterization. Diversified trade relationships increase network flexibility and anti-risk capabilities of countries in the network but also decrease the leaderships of some hub countries. During the transmission process, there are four patterns: direct contact transmission, indirect contact transmission, nucleus transmission, and spatial transmission.

Taking the data on bank equity return indices for G7 economies, the results indicate the symmetric dependence structure between the UK and Italian banks and the asymmetric dependence between the UK and the rest of G7 banks.

This coupled with sudden and periodic crashes in global and developed equity markets have stimulated the interest of investors to diversify across markets that have the potential to provide decorrelation with global markets during turbulent periods. At the same time, international diversification may intensify cross-border listing of stocks with its antecedent implication of shocks transmission. The above have engendered renewed interest among researchers to explore the dependence levels and spillover effects of shocks among emerging and developed equity markets. This paper examines tail dependence structure and (extreme) systemic risks spillover effects among international equity markets using advanced econometric techniques that underpin the modelling of asset returns. We find evidence of low positive significant dependencies between all African markets and their developed counterparts, except for Egypt. Although no evidence of spillover effects to the markets in Africa was found, both unidirectional and bi-directional causality between some African and developed equity markets is found, albeit with differences. We are unable to ascribe the dynamics in the causality structure to level of market integration. It is inferred that the degree of individual local markets interdependence with developed counterparts may reflect the relative size, liquidity and degree of foreign investors' participation. © 2017 Economic Society of South Africa.",Africa; CoVaR-copula; equity markets; spillover effects; systemic risk,capital flow; capital market; covariance analysis; equity; spillover effect; stock market; Africa,"Boako, G.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Ghana; email: gboako@gmail.com",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,00382280,,,,English,S.

One of the objectives of creating these models is to explain and understand financial fluctuations through a consistent theoretical framework. In the tourism sector, stock price and systemic risk are key financial variables in the international transmission of business cycles. Advances in Bayesian theory are providing an increasing range of tools that researchers can employ to estimate and evaluate DSGE and VAR models. One area of interest in previous literature has been to design a Bayesian robust filter, that performs well concerning an uncertainty class of possible models compatible with prior knowledge. In this study, we propose to apply the Bayesian Kalman Filter with Prior Update (BKPU) in a tourism field to increase the robustness of DSGE and VAR models built for small samples and with irregular data. Our results indicate that BKPU improves the estimation of these models in two aspects. Firstly, the accuracy levels of the computing of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo model are increased, and secondly, the cost of the resources used is reduced due to the need for a shorter run time. Our model can play an essential role in the monetary policy process, as central bankers could use it to investigate the relative importance of different macroeconomic shocks and the effects of tourism stock prices and achieve a country´s international competitiveness and trade balance for this sector. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Bayesian kalman filter; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium; Markov chain monte carlo; Prior update; Systemic risk; Tourism stock prices; Volatility,Computation theory; Costs; Economics; Markov processes; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; Bayesian; Bayesian kalman filter; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium; General equilibrium; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Prior update; Stochastics; Stock price; Systemic risks; Tourism stock price; Tourism stocks; Volatility; Kalman filters,"Alaminos, D.; Department of Business, Spain; email: alaminos@ub.edu",Rutkowski L.Rutkowski L.Scherer R.Korytkowski M.Pedrycz W.Tadeusiewicz R.Zurada J.M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,03029743,9783031234798,,,English,Lect.

Since hydropower depends on water availability, it is particularly vulnerable to drought events, making the Brazilian electricity matrix vulnerable to climate change. Starting in 2005, Brazil opened the matrix to new renewable sources, including sugarcane-based electricity. Sugarcane is known for its resilience to short dry spells. Over the last decades, its production area moved from the coastal plains of the Atlantic Forest biome to the savannahs of the Cerrado biome, which is characterised by a five-to six month-long dry season. The sugarcane-based electricity system is highly dynamic and complex due to the interlinkages, dependencies, and cascading impacts between its agricultural and industrial subsystems. This paper applies the risk framework proposed by the IPCC to assess climate-change-driven drought risks to sugarcane electricity generation systems to identify their strengths and weaknesses, considering the system dynamics and linkages. Our methodology aims to understand and characterize drought in the agriculture as well as industrial subsystems and offers a specific understanding of the system by using indicators tailored to sugarcane-based electricity generation. Our results underline the relevance of actions at different levels of management. Initiatives, such as regional weather forecasts specifically for agriculture, and measures to increase industrial water-use efficiency were identified to be essential to reduce the drought risk. Actions from farmers and mill owners, supported and guided by the government at different levels, have the potential to increase the resilience of the system. For example, the implementation of small dams was identified by local actors as a promising intervention to adapt to the long dry seasons; however, they need to be implemented based on a proper technical assessment in order to locate these dams in suitable places. Moreover, the results show that creating and maintaining small water reservoirs to enable the adoption of deficit-controlled irrigation technology contribute to reducing the overall drought risk of the sugarcane-based electricity generation system. © 2022 by the authors.

At the same time, the adverse effects of global environmental change such as global warming, extreme events, and outbreaks of pandemics significantly hinder SIDS' progress towards sustainable development. This paper makes a conceptual contribution by framing the vulnerability of small islands from the perspective of socio-metabolic risk (SMR). SMR is defined as systemic risk associated with the availability of critical resources, the integrity of material circulation, and the (in)equitable distribution of derived products and societal services in a socio-ecological system. We argue that specific configurations and combinations of material stocks and flows on islands and their 'resistance to change' contribute to the system's proliferation of SMR. For better or for worse, these influence the system's ability to consistently and effectively deliver societal services necessary for survival. By positioning SMR as a subset of systemic risk, the paper illustrates SMRs and tipping points on small islands using insights from three sectors: water, waste, and infrastructure. We also identify effective leverage points and adaptation strategies for building system resilience on small islands. In conclusion, our synthesis suggests that governing SMR on SIDS would mean governing socio-metabolic flows to avoid potential disruptions in the circulation of critical resources and the maintenance of vital infrastructures and services while inducing interventions towards positive social tipping dynamics. Such interventions will need strategies to reconfigure resource-use patterns and associated services that are sustainable and socially equitable. © 2022 The Author(s).

Automatic and objective assessment of vessel changes can effectively manage diabetic retinopathy and prevent blindness. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics have been confirmed to be used to assess vessel changes. The accuracy and reliability of OCTA metrics are restricted by vessel segmentation methods. In this study, a multi-branch retinal vessel segmentation method is proposed, which is comparable to the segmentation results obtained from the manual segmentation, effectively extracting vessels in low contrast areas and improving the integrity of the extracted vessels. OCTA metrics based on the proposed segmentation method were validated to be reliable for further analysis of the relationship between OCTA metrics and diabetes and the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Changes in vessel morphology are influenced by systemic risk factors. However, there is a lack of analysis of the relationship between OCTA metrics and systemic risk factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 362 eyes of 221 diabetic patients and 1,151 eyes of 587 healthy people. Eight systemic risk factors were confirmed to be closely related to diabetes. After controlling these systemic risk factors, significant OCTA metrics (such as vessel complexity index, vessel diameter index, and mean thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer centered in the macular) were found to be related to diabetic retinopathy and severe diabetic retinopathy. This study provides evidence to support the potential value of OCTA metrics as biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy.

Accordingly, the FRC updated the Stewardship Code in 2020 in a final bid to prove its effectiveness and relevance, and, in particular, to enhance issuer-specific engagement by institutional investors. The update has enhanced the reach and substance of the Code. However, the legal, regulatory, contractual and competitive environment in which institutional investors exist will constantly forestall soft-law attempts to foster greater issuer-specific engagement, a point perhaps tacitly acknowledged by the 2020 Stewardship Code with its wider scope. Instead, in relation to engagement, stewardship disclosure should focus on the types of engagement that institutional investors are motivated to exercise in practice, such as engagement in response to hedge fund activism, and engagement on systemic risks. © 2021 The Authors.

As an efficient method for addressing the problem of “too big to fail,” CoCo bonds have received widespread attention, particularly because the trigger for CoCo bonds is a systemic risk event. Thus, the impact of CoCo bonds on systemic risk needs to be addressed. To solve this problem, we adopt default contagion and loss amplification due to network linkage to measure systemic risk, from which we can ascertain the potential impact on it of CoCo bonds. The results show that CoCo bonds enhance the spillover effect of the issuer's default; meanwhile, sufficient CoCo bonds partly offset the impact of default contagion from other banks. Furthermore, CoCo bonds enhance the amplification effect of loss due to network linkage, but the amplification effect diminishes after the bankruptcy cost is considered. Finally, the numerical test provides some insight into how the issuance of writedown (WD) bonds influences commercial banks in China. Our study not only offers suggestions to the regulators of CoCo bonds but also contributes to related studies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Contingent convertible bonds; Default contagion; Loss amplification; Network model,,"Li, P.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: liping124@buaa.edu.cn",,Elsevier Inc.,10629408,,,,English,North Am.

Based on the copula results, we estimate the systemic crude oil price risk to different sectors using CoVaR and delta CoVaR. A fleeting positive sectoral CoVaR and delta CoVaR across all sectors implies a time-varying oil price systemic risk. Yet, little difference between CoVaR and VaR across the sectors reveals that a bearish oil market does not add additional systemic risk to a bearish sectoral equity market. The carbon sector is found to be the safe haven investment when both the equity and the oil markets are in a downward phase. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",CoVaR; Delta CoVaR; Dependence asymmetry; Dependence-switching copula; India; Oil price; Sectoral markets,,"Jena, S.K.; International Management InstituteIndia; email: drsangramkjena@gmail.com",,Springer,02545330,,,,English,Ann.

In particular, we focused on investments from banks to firms and researched the number of bankrupt banks and firms varying two parameters: 1. Lending threshold of banks; 2. Lending sensibility to a firm's growth rate. As results, we got two results: 1. As banks have a lower lending threshold, the average number of bankrupt of banks and firms rises; 2. The lending threshold of banks and lending sensibility to firms' growth rate increases the disparity between firms. These results suggest that greater investment have negative effects on both banks and firms and biased investment enlarge the disparity between firms. © 2019 IEEE.",,Average numbers; Economic system; Rate increase; Systemic risks; Two parameter; Investments,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1062922X,9781728145693,PICYE,,English,Conf.

When conducting panel regression analysis, we document the following findings. First, not all shocks have the same effect on bank risk. Due to oil supply shocks, the increase in oil price raises bank risk, whereas the similar increase in price due to economic expansion or oil-market specific demand reduces that risk. Second, the business model (whether the bank is Islamic or conventional), size, income diversification, profitability, and financial leverage influence the bank risk exposure to oil shocks differently. Third, the two major recent crises (global financial crises and COVID-19 pandemic) magnified bank risk exposure to oil supply shocks and speculative oil demand shocks. Overall, the structural oil shocks explain a large fraction of the variation in financial stability in GCC countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Bank risk; Bank-level characteristics; Financial stability; GCC countries; Global crises; Oil price shocks,,"Maghyereh, A.; Department of Accounting and Finance, United Arab Emirates; email: a.almaghaireh@uaeu.ac.ae",,Elsevier B.V.,09393625,,,,English,Econ.

We evaluated exposure of the plate in such reconstructions by comparing the results of a radial forearm flap (RFF)with a vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap (VLMF). We also analysed the resection margins and the incidence of secondary osseous reconstructions after one year free from relapse. We retrospectively examined all 48 mandibular reconstructions in which a reconstruction plate and RFF or VLMF had been used between 2007 and 2016. Exposure rates of plates were assessed and local (size and site of resection)and systemic risk factors (age, sex, treatment with radiation, and smoking)evaluated. Reconstruction plates, together with a RFF, were significantly more likely to be exposed than those with a VLMF (p = 0.01). There was significantly more exposure in the RFF group in mandibular defects larger than 6 cm, in contrast to the VLMF group (p = 0.002). Younger age (p < 0.001), lower body mass index (BMI)(p = 0.05)and smoking (p = 0.011)led to more exposure. In seven cases a second operation was necessary due to macroscopically invaded or close margins. Thirty-one patients had no bony reconstruction because of local recurrence, distant metastases, inadequate resection margins, poor general condition, or a second (different)tumour. Exposure of the plate after mandibular reconstruction happens less often with the VLM flap than with the RFF.

Using quarterly G7 data over a long period covering 1970–2021, our results indicate that these systematic risks both are very volatile. Moreover, the dominant source of causality in the housing systematic risk implies that policies directed against the possibility of a housing bubble, for example, macroprudential toolkits, deserve special emphasis.

A typical feature of erysipelas, especially on the lower limbs, is the tendency to reoccur and the study aimed to define the comorbidities associated with it. AIM: We aimed to investigate systemic and local comorbidities in patients diagnosed with erysipelas on the lower limbs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospectively-prospective, population-based cohort study which included all patients diagnosed with erysipelas on the lower limbs, during two years. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with first episode and patients with recurrent erysipelas. These two groups were compared, with particular emphasis on systemic and local comorbidities. RESULTS: The study included 313 patients, of which 187 with the first episode of erysipelas and 126 with a recurrent. Regarding the analyzed systemic risk factors, the recurrent erysipelas was significantl y associated with obesity (p < 0.0001), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0015), history of malignant disease (p = 0.02) and tonsillectomy (p = 0.000001). For a p-value < 0.0001, significantly more frequent finding of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, chronic oedema/lymphoedema, fungal infections of the affected leg and chronic ulcer was confirmed in recurrent erysipelas. Neuropathy had 23% of the recurrent cases and 8.6% in patients without recurrence, and the difference was found to be significant for p = 0.0003. The only dissection of the lymph nodes was found more frequently in recurrent erysipelas (p = 0.017), but no associations with other analysed local surgery on the affected leg. Patients with recurrent erysipelas had ipsilateral coexisting dermatitis p = 0.00003 significantly more frequent. Minor trauma often preceded the first episode of erysipelas p = 0.005. CONCLUSION: Identification and treatment of modifiable risk factors are expected to reduce the risk of a subsequent episode of erysipelas on the lower limbs. © 2019 Vesna Brishkoska-Boshkovski, Irena Kondova-Topuzovska, Katerina Damevska, Andrej Petrov.",Erysipelas; Lymphoedema; Recurrent; Risk factor,adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; erysipelas; follow up; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; interview; lower limb; lymph node; lymphedema; major clinical study; mycosis; neuropathy; obesity; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prospective study; recurrent disease; retrospective study; risk factor; tonsillectomy,"Brishkoska-Boshkovski, V.; Department of Dermatology, Macau; email: vbrishkoska@yahoo.com",,Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,18579655,,,,English,Open Access Maced.

New BREXIT aspects are considered in an enhanced Branson model. Macroprudential supervision is a crucial policy challenge for EU28 in the context of BREXIT and the European Systemic Risk Board thus should have a critical role in 2019 and the following years. The ESRB should timely analyze the potential risk of BREXIT and consider adequate policy options to reduce or eliminate risks. Contract continuity as well as cooperation in prudential supervision between the EU27 and the UK stand for BREXIT-related problems that could create financial market stability – as is the BREXIT-induced UK deregulation pressure. EU prudential supervision post-BREXIT faces problems since a very large part of EU27 wholesale banking markets in the UK and thus not regulated by the EU after March 29, 2019. The EU Commission’s competence for EU trade policy as well as international investment treaties gives the EU the opportunity to offer the UK not only a – limited – Free Trade Agreement but an international investment treaty as well, including options for global cooperation.

This paper reports a comprehensive literature review for 1989–2013 (inclusive), the first 25 years in which this topic appeared in scientific journals. It explores the extent to which articles have identified potentially catastrophic, civilization-endangering health risks associated with climate change. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were primarily used to identify articles which were then ranked on a three-point scale. Each score reflected the extent to which papers discussed global systemic risk. Citations were also analyzed. Results: Of 2143 analyzed papers 1546 (72%) were scored as one. Their citations (165,133) were 82% of the total. The proportion of annual papers scored as three was initially high, as were their citations but declined to almost zero by 1996, before rising slightly from 2006. Conclusions: The enormous expansion of the literature appropriately reflects increased understanding of the importance of climate change to global health. However, recognition of the most severe, existential, health risks from climate change was generally low. Most papers instead focused on infectious diseases, direct heat effects and other disciplinary-bounded phenomena and consequences, even though scientific advances have long called for more inter-disciplinary collaboration. © 2018 by the author.

Next, we show how inter-institutional liability connections and portfolio diversification can amplify the impact of initial negative shocks and lead later to financial crisis. We prove that illiquidity is a critical factor in triggering risk contagion and that higher inter-institutional leverage can cause larger losses for both the institutions and the outside obligees.

These include: (1) a combination of coercive and subversive activity, (2) conventional and unconventional methods, (3) state or non-state actors, and (4) activities that remain below the threshold of detection and attribution. In general, hybrid threats affect multiple domains, create ambiguity, and are likely to exploit the vulnerabilities, caused by systemic risks. In recent years, the exposure of energy assets, such as the natural gas transmission system, on hybrid threats has significantly increased. Towards this direction, the current study aims to develop a composite index that measures at a country level the resilience of the European natural gas network against hybrid threats. For this purpose, a comprehensive set of indicators is established and quantified, categorized into four major resilience dimensions; (i) infrastructure, (ii) socio-economic, (iii) political, and (iv) external factors. Indicators are quantified based on in-house data of PSI, data from reliable international sources, or a combination thereof. The evaluation model to be constructed, based on the preference information, provided by selected experts, will be applied in conjunction with an MCDA aggregation framework.

Our results indicate how connected the topics are so that we can correlate any abnormal behaviours with volatility in the financial markets. With the 2015–2016 stock market selloff and COVID-19 as use cases, our results also suggest that the proposed DTN approach can provide an indication of (a) abnormal movement in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and (b) when the market would gradually begin to recover from such an event. From a practical risk management point of view, this analysis can be carried out on a daily basis when new data come in so that we can make use of the calculated metrics to predict real-time systemic risk in financial markets. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,"So, M.K.P.; Department of Information Systems, Hong Kong; email: immkpso@ust.hk",,Nature Research,20452322,,,35177679.0,English,Sci.

Since the objective of Basel regulations is to achieve a stable banking sector by mitigating risks, we examine the impact of bank regulations on various risks of IBs and CBs by using a regression framework. We examine solvency risk, credit risk, idiosyncratic risk and systemic risk by using capital oversight, restriction on activities, private monitoring and supervisory power bank regulation data provided by the World Bank. The findings show that though the Basel regulations were originally developed for CBs, our results imply that they are effective for IBs as well as CBs. However, our study also shows that regulations affect IBs and CBs differently as their business models are different. More targeted regulations towards IBs would be necessary to support IBs. Additionally, in regions with higher economic freedom indexes, banking regulations can mitigate the risk of IBs and CBs to a greater extent. Our results imply that the combination of free economic policies and banking supervision addresses risks in banking effectively. Finally, the bank regulations did not appear to be able to control the risk of the sample banks during the 2007–2009 crisis. Hence, the Basel committee needs to rethink about regulations during crisis times. © 2021 The Authors.

The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MIDAS-QR-CoVaR, which has smaller failure times and average errors than the commonly used DCC-GARCH-CoVaR and QR-CoVaR approaches. Moreover, we observe elevated systemic risk during the financial turmoils. Notably, there is a sharp increase corresponding to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

This article takes a different systemic perspective, pointing to the dynamic and collective features that generate a banking system within and across financial institutions. Classic features such as bank credit creation, as well as classic issues such as bank runs, are reconsidered under the notion of a ‘banking system’ requiring coordination over time and circumstances. Our conceptual framework develops a heuristic model of the basic mechanisms on which bank money creation lays upon. This model disentangles the link between functional and institutional dimensions of the money system, aiming to include minimal institutions in economic theory and economic analysis of money. These basic mechanisms include: monetary financial institutions (bank entities) issue claims which function as money; they facilitate payments across agents in the economy over time and space; they increase the money base through credit creation; they hold fractional reserves and lend to each other. Ongoing bank activity involves cash and non-cash (accrual) processes occurring within each bank entity and across them. Each bank keeps currency money in bank deposits on behalf of other agents. But the bank activity is further characterised by the capacity or privilege to use these deposits, although the latter remain available for payment and redemption at will and at par. Moreover, the bank can create deposit by granting a loan to, or buy a security from a borrower. This bank capacity or privilege involves money generation that enables the bank credit manufacturing process. In this way, all the banks become interdependent on the flow of payments that are performed across them, generating the ‘banking system’. Since each bank is structurally unbalanced due to money generation, inter-bank coordination is required to maintain the banking system in operation over time and circumstances. Both inter-bank clearing and credit arrangements provide this coordination at the inter-bank level, which is effectuated through central bank intervention, clearing houses and the money market. From this systemic perspective, ‘systemic risk’ and ‘macro-prudential’ management and regulation are new labels for recurrent concerns of systemic coordination. A careful combination of design and policy is therefore required to reach coordination in view to prevent or respond to local and systemic crises. Drawing upon this conceptual framework, this article develops institutional economic analysis and implications for shadow banking; systemic risk, interdependency and interconnectedness; the relationship between money and credit and the real economy; and the systemic consistency between functions and institutions in monetary regimes. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Banking; Credit; Financial regulation; Money,,"Biondi, Y.; IRISSO, France; email: yuri.biondi@gmail.com",,De Gruyter,21522820,,,,English,Account.

Recent catastrophes underline the importance of avoiding local flood management, but characterizing large scale basin wide approaches for systemic flood risk management. Here we introduce an information-theoretic Portfolio Decision Model (iPDM) for the optimization of a systemic ecosystem value at the basin scale by evaluating all potential flood risk mitigation plans. iPDM calculates the ecosystem value predicted by all feasible combinations of flood control structures (FCS) considering environmental, social and economical asset criteria. A multi-criteria decision analytical model evaluates the benefits of all FCS portfolios at the basin scale weighted by stakeholder preferences for assets’ criteria as ecosystem services. The risk model is based on a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) that predicts the flood susceptibility, the risk of floods based on the exceedance probability distribution, and its most important drivers. Information theoretic global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is used to select the simplest and most accurate model based on a flood return period. A stochastic optimization algorithm optimizes the ecosystem value constrained to the budget available and provides Pareto frontiers of optimal FCS plans for any budget level. Pareto optimal solutions maximize FCS diversity and minimize the criticality of floods manifested by the scaling exponent of the Pareto distribution of flood size that links management and hydrogeomorphological patterns. The proposed model is tested on the 17,000 km2 Tiber river basin in Italy. iPDM allows stakeholders to identify optimal FCS plans in river basins for a comprehensive evaluation of flood effects under future ecosystem trajectories. © 2019",Floods; MaxEnt; MCDA; Portfolio decision model; River basin management; Systemic risk,Budget control; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Ecosystems; Flood control; Information theory; Pareto principle; Risk assessment; Risk management; Rivers; Scales (weighing instruments); Uncertainty analysis; Water management; Watersheds; MaxEnt; MCDA; Portfolio decisions; River basin management; Systemic risks; Floods; algorithm; catastrophic event; environmental risk; flood; flood control; flooding; model; risk assessment; river basin; river management; software; strategic approach; sustainable development,"Convertino, M.; Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Kita 14, Nishi 9, Kita-ku, 11-11, Japan; email: matteo@ist.hokudai.ac.jp",,Elsevier Ltd,13648152,,EMSOF,,English,Environ.

MPT has no mechanism to understand its impacts on the environmental, social and financial systems, nor any tools for investors to mitigate the havoc that systemic risks can wreck on their portfolios. It's time for MPT to evolve. The authors propose a new imperative to improve finance's ability to fulfil its twin main purposes: providing adequate returns to individuals and directing capital to where it is needed in the economy. They show how some of the largest investors in the world focus not on picking stocks, but on mitigating systemic risks, such as climate change and a lack of gender diversity, so as to improve the risk/return of the market as a whole, despite current theory saying that should be impossible. ""Moving beyond MPT"" recognizes the complex relations between investing and the systems on which capital markets rely, ""Investing that matters"" embraces MPT's focus on diversification and risk adjusted return, but understands them in the context of the real economy and the total return needs of investors. Whether an investor, an MBA student, a Finance Professor or a sustainability professional, Moving Beyond Modern Portfolio Theory: Investing That Matters is thought-provoking and relevant.

A unifying principle among the various directed and dynamic spectrum access approaches is the effect that uncertainty has on system performance. Risk, uncertainty, and performance are inseparably tied together. We naturally desire high performance (e.g., user capacity and density) coupled with a low risk of interference and a high level of coexistence between SDS networks. There is an inherent need to optimize spectrum utilization dynamically and efficiently between and among diverse commercial and government SDS networks. This includes supporting a wide range of distributed, decentralized, and centralized SDS architectures and management approaches. While the basic technical challenges associated with dynamic spectrum sharing have largely been overcome, these systems typically do not focus on developing mechanisms to make realistic assessment of performance and interference risks. Our paper introduces the topic of Spectrum Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA), in the context of RF interference mitigation and spectrum coexistence between and among commercial and government SDS networks. Spectrum QRA provides an approach to identify, assess, and reduce systemic risk in SDSs, both initially during planning stages, as well as in an online manner during field operations. Section I introduces the problem while section II covers related work. Section III embarks in the description of our Spectrum QRA framework, including a taxonomy of spectrum access risks inherent to a variety of SDSs. A generic architecture, centered around a QRA-based planning server, is introduced to assist in the planning of spectrum access before deployment and during real-time operations. Section IV describes a simulation environment for Spectrum QRA and discusses preliminary experimental results. Section V summarizes the key findings and elaborates on future Spectrum QRA research. © 2022 IEEE.",interference; quantitative risk assessment; spectrum management; spectrum sharing,Memory architecture; Network architecture; Dynamic spectrum; Interference; Performance; Quantitative risk assessment; Spectra's; Spectrum access; Spectrum management; Spectrum sharing; Systems networks; Uncertainty; Risk assessment,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781665485340,PMICE,,English,Proc IEEE Mil Commun Conf MILCOM,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147331260,scopus

We build a model that focuses on systemic consequences of funding risk and its links with solvency conditions and account for pertinent interactions between market participants in an agent-based modelling fashion. The model is brought to a set of real banking system data of the stress test component of the 2014 Comprehensive Assessment in the EU, covering all the major banking groups in the EU. The potential shock amplification role of asset managers is studied in the theoretical part of the model, with some styled calibration and simulations. We investigate importance of the channels through which the funding shock hitting financial institutions can propagate across the financial system. We find that the drivers of the contagion transmission, related to available liquidity and capital buffers, sensitivities of funding cost to loss absorption capacity and asset prices to fire sales of assets depend on the heterogeneity of the agents in the financial system. Second, liquidity requirements are effective instruments to mitigate contagion risk. Third, the relationship between funding shocks and contagion losses is nonlinear and exhibits cliff effects. Fourth, we find evidence of an active cross-border channel of contagion with losses spreading from one country to another. Finally, behaviours of the agents under adverse funding conditions can influence the structure of the financial market and the topology of the interbank network under stress depends on the stringency of the regulatory requirements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based models; Liquidity; Systemic risk,Autonomous agents; Banking; Commerce; Computational methods; Electronic trading; Risk assessment; Risk management; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Comprehensive assessment; Financial institution; Liquidity; Regulatory requirements; Risk management application; Systemic risks; Costs,,,Elsevier B.V.,03784371,,PHYAD,,English,Phys A Stat Mech Appl,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051654395,scopus

The resulting subsidy drives rates down and leads to a more clustered interbank network, particularly during crises.

Index insurance offers structural advantages compared with conventional insurance, including moral hazard, adverse selection, and systemic risk. It also represents a promising financial tool because of its potential to provide timely economic relief after an unusual weather event by indemnifying policyholders based on the observed value of a particular index directly related to weather parameters. Because of these advantages, this type of insurance can potentially be extended to more crop-productive regions. This study examines the possible spread of weather index insurance programs for Arabica Coffee in Colombia in the short and medium terms in aggregated regions, according to the wet and dry crop seasons. Using a short historical precipitation data from 2010 to 2019 for 163 productive zones in 11 departments located at altitudes of 990–1,890 m, we use an unsupervised technique to first cluster the observations through mixture modeling. Then, we extract through singular spectrum analysis, the signal components of precipitation of each cluster and seasons to propose a simple index insurance model which determines the immediate payoff disbursals. We particularly identify the behavior of the tendency and seasonal payoffs. Finally, we forecast the tendency components in each cluster and season to derive a ratio of future payoffs in exceedance. This ratio serves as a measure of financial risk as it represents future additional payments that are expected to be disbursed due to the tendency component. The results have important implications for designing agricultural hedging instruments for coffee producers at an individual scale or as reinsurance instruments. © 2022",Financial risk measure; Index insurance; Payoffs in exceedance; Singular spectrum analysis (SSA),,"Abrego-Perez Adriana, L.Cra 1 N° 18A- 12 Bogotá, Colombia; email: al.abrego@uniandes.edu.co",,Elsevier B.V.,22120963,,,,English,Clim.

These risks might seem far in the future, but on our current path, three meters of sea level rise (SLR) is plausible by 2100, which would permanently submerge the equivalent of 22 Singapores of urban real estate from just 20 APAC capitals and economic hubs. Central Banks and regulators around the world have formed an 80+ member strong coalition to prepare for such systemic risks due to the clustering of assets and people in vulnerable locations. With the financial sector waking up to these significant tail risks, valuation adjustments are inevitable. This is not about natural capital accounting but real risk adjustments; the same way leasehold property is afforded a lower valuation compared to freehold assets, SLR will have a clear downward impact on valuations in coastal areas as the permanent loss of land will shorten the lifespan of all assets located there. As such locked-in threats question the going concern status of these assets, this should lead to the re-assessment of discount rates, terminal values, capital adequacy ratios, and the cost of capital, which will all affect sovereign and credit ratings as well as equity or project valuations. However, although chronic risks from sea level rise are recognized, there is still no consensus on the path forward regarding their assessment or valuation, which has led to a negative finance feedback loop. This chapter delves into the magnitude of these coastal threats and their ability to trigger systemic shocks.

These connections among financial institutions constitute the three most common financial networks, which may lead to financial risk contagion and even systemic risk when some institutions suffer shock. In this paper, firstly, for a given shock, we prove the existence of the equilibrium clearing vector of the financial system characterized by these three typical financial networks. Then, we mathematically derive an analytical form to show how these three contagion channels jointly affect and amplify the loss of the non-default institutions, and explain how the lack of liquidity of external investment assets exacerbates the loss caused by portfolio overlapping. Finally, the influence of the characteristics of financial network on risk contagion is verified by numerical simulation.

The systemic risk is composed of two different components: the time and the cross-dimension. The first refers to the accumulation of banking risk and its interaction with the business cycle, while the second concern, the high-level concentration of the specific risk on relevant financial institutions. Thanks to the three-way analysis, we can, on the one hand, estimate a new measure of systemic risk based on these both components, and, on the other hand, we can transparently identify the SIBs (systemically important banks). To this end, we have empirically evaluated and compared the marginal expected shortfall (MES), the SRISK measure and the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) based on a representative sample of Eurozone institutions listed on the stock exchange for the period from June 2005 to May 2018. Our results show how these systemic risk measures produce different systemic risk classifications for the same bank. The findings, therefore, highlight the fragility and structural dependence of these measures, which may not be used for the estimation of a stable rank. Applying three-way factorial analysis, we show how our measure gives a more stable score. Moreover, our index is the first one to be composed of both the cross-section and the temporal components, essential elements for a proper assessment of systemic risk. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",banking supervisor; composite Index; multi-way analysis; systemic important bank; systemic risk raking,banking; business cycle; risk assessment; stock market,"Foglia, M.; Department of Economics, Italy; email: matteo.foglia@unich.it",,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,10769307,,,,English,Int.

However, these types of crowdfunding have, for the most part, remained a phenomenon of those larger Member States that ‘draw a crowd’, with populations that are large enough to make crowdfunding systems economically feasible. In turn, crowdfunding has remained a mainly national issue, prompting the European Commission to conclude that there is no need for harmonization of crowdfunding rules in Europe. In contrast to the European Commission’s Capital Market Action Plan, this paper takes the view that national limitations on crowdinvesting and crowdlending de facto are the result of limits de iure. Given that no European passport is tailor made or fits crowdfunding, this source of financing is doomed to remain national. Moreover, with different legal requirements in Member States, European law hinders the development of cross-border crowdfunding within the region. This is particularly true for smaller Member States whose populations are too small to constitute ‘a crowd’. This paper details how European regulators could facilitate a Single European Crowdfunding Market. Regulation of the crowdfunding platform based on the ‘MiFID light’ framework could function as the basis for a cross-border crowdfunding manager passport, given the minimum protection it affords both investors and the financial system, and the low costs it imposes on the platform. Following the (1) too-small-to-care, (2) too-large-to-ignore, and (3) too-big-to-fail development path of FinTech business models, we suggest adding a relevance threshold of EUR250,000 in transaction volume to the MiFID light framework and imposing regulation to address systemic risk stemming from very large crowdfunding platforms. © 2018, T.M.C.

The systemic risk buildup within the industry is mainly depicted as an unstable, diluted, and possibly depleting process. Gloomy predictions persist in the subsequent attempts to uncover plausible causes of systemic risk formation. Mainly, conventional defining factors for risk exhibit irrelevance toward systemic risk development, as threats to financial stability remain confined within the industry, supported by a lack of diversification in financial services.

Further, we analyse the dynamic response of shadow banking to financial risk shocks and regulatory shocks, and examine the influence of shadow banking on the transmission path of systemic risks, so as to provide theoretical bases for financial supply-side structural reforms in the context of high-quality development. To this end, this article constructs the multi-sector DSGE model that includes the shadow banking sector and the commercial banking sector that subjects to multiple credit regulatory constraints. And then the five-variable VAR model is used to conduct empirical tests. Empirical research has found that Chinese-style shadow banking exhibits countercyclical characteristics, and the existence of shadow banking reduces the transmission effectiveness of credit channel. Numerical simulation analysis finds that positive interest rate shocks would trigger the expansion of shadow banks and increase leverage, while reducing the credit leverage of commercial banks.

The suspension of bank funding directly causes a loss of depositor settlement methods. This subject attracts much attention from the nation because of the possibility of an increase in the national burden if public funds are injected to banks in the event of a financial crisis. Although many researchers have attempted to understand the propagation mechanisms of the crises in Systemic risk, the mechanism is not yet clearly understood. This research proposes a new agent-based modeling method for systemic risk based on a model that uses simple balance sheets and regulations of the financial institution. The model considers liquidity effects on interbank networks and endogenous risks. Using this model, this research validates the effect of bankruptcy in the case of the structure of the financial group in regional banks. In Japan, cases of financial groups, which is a kind of merger, are increasing recently in regional banks in particular, and it is significant to clarify the effect of the resilience of bankruptcy. In this research, our aim is to evaluate the effect of loss-absorbing mechanism that can be taken when banks constituting the financial group falls into a crisis of bankruptcy. And we made it clear that the selection of the banks that make up the financial group has an impact on the loss propagation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Agent-based modeling; Financial group; Network theory; Systemic risk,,"Hashimoto, M.; Business science, 3-29-1 Otsuka, Japan; email: Morito.Hashimoto@gmail.com",,Springer Singapore,,9789811383199; 9789811383182,,,English,Network Theory and Agent-Based Modeling in Economics and Finance,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085417465,scopus

Whereas some aggregate indicators have shown improvement over the year, the cumulative growth rates in consumption and fixed asset investment have continued their downward trajectories. Worsening income inequality and resource misallocations, both between secondary and tertiary industries, and within the latter, pose serious challenges, let alone the systemic risk associated with the flourishing shadow banking system, rapid credit growth and debt overhang that weigh on the Chinese economy like the Sword of Damocles. This summary report highlights both the status quo and the consequences of the unbalanced and inadequate development embodied in China's persistently distorted economic structure, and the role of deepening reforms of the institutions and governance in resolving the problems. Our analyses based on IAR-CMM model provide a unified framework for addressing China's short-, medium-, and long-term issues in an internally coherent manner. Looking into year 2018, our benchmark projection of real GDP growth rate is 6.7% (6.41% using more reliable rather than the official data). Alternative scenario analyses and policy simulations are conducted to reflect various aspects of the economic challenges in the short to long runs. Through the lens of these analyses we conclude that rule-of-law based and market-oriented structural reforms should continue to hold a center stage in China's transition from a phase of high-speed but unbalanced growth, to a stage of balanced and adequate high-quality development. © 2018 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

Simultaneously, statistical analysis is used to verify the analysis, and the MATLAB statistical tool is used to build the model. The results show that the actual expected yield of China’s medical sector is significantly higher than that calculated by the CAPM before and after the pandemic, and that the investment value of the medical sector is undervalued by the market. From the perspective of risk, China’s medical sector has a stable systemic risk premium.

Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the United States lags in consumer financial technology. This Article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators. Competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. No agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition. Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""Too Big to Fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in Google, Facebook, and Amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation. © 2018 American Statistical Association.

These new types of risks do not respect national boundaries nor are they restricted to particular locations or systems. Instead, they are characterized by contagion and proliferation processes, frequently on the basis of a network structure, with the result that a seemingly harmless local event is able to cause a complete system collapse. The proposal has been made to refer to these types of new risks as systemic risks. It turns out that key phenomena associated with systemic risks can quite naturally be categorized and analyzed in terms of notions originally established in the natural sciences, such as those of chaos, order, and self-organization, or, more concisely, of dynamic structure generation in complex open systems. In this Essay, the claim is made that there is a homomorphism within the dynamic structure generation across very different domains of systemic risks. Furthermore, there are structural similarities between complex structures in general, and systemic risks in particular. Based on this assumption, one can use established methodologies of complexity science to reveal general macroscopic patterns that seem to govern the dynamics of complex systems. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods: This cross-sectional study obtained OCTA data from patients with T2DM administered at hospital and referred to ophthalmic services. Patient data about demographics, comorbid conditions, and blood biomarkers were extracted from electronic medical records. Data from OCTA scans obtained by CIRRUS HD-OCT Model 5,000 were obtained. Vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) within the superficial capillary plexus, and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were automatically segmented. These parameters were tested for their correlations with systemic factors by univariate and multivariable linear regression analyses. Results: A total of 144 T2DM patients (236 eyes) were available for analysis, with mean age of 53.6 (SD = 10.34) and 56.9% were male. Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, increased serum creatinine (Scr), red blood cell count (RBC), platelets (PLT), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and decreased urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) were significantly associated with lower VD and PD (all p < 0.013). UACR and triglyceride (TRIG) were significantly correlated with FAZ area (all p < 0.017). In multivariate analyses, PLT, eGFR, and APOB were independent risk factors for retinal rarefaction, and UACR was a significant predictor of FAZ area. Conclusion: We found several systemic risk factors, such as PLT, renal function and lipid profiles were associated with PD, VD, and FAZ area among Chinese T2DM patients.

The asymptotic behavior of the measure is studied in both the asymptotic independence and asymptotic dependence cases, and some asymptotic formulas with the uniformity in the whole time horizon are derived when the claim size distributions belong to the class of regular variation. The obtained results do not depend on specific setups of the renewal claim-number process, and they are also insensitive to specific dependence structures in the asymptotic independence case. These facts make our results concise in form and flexible in application. More interestingly, our results for the corresponding discounted version of the measure have nothing to do with the time variable. Hence, the discounted version of the measure can be regarded approximately as a static (i.e., time-invariant) risk measure of the dynamic system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Asymptotic behavior; Dependence; Dynamic systemic risk measure; Regular variation,,,,Elsevier B.V.,01676687,,IMECD,,English,Insur.

The systemic risk studied is that resulting from a common exposure of banking insti¬ tutions: when the latter diversify their activities, the compositions of their assets converge, making them therefore susceptible to the same shocks. In this context, the contribution of this article is threefold: firstly, it analyzes the evolution of capital that would compensate for the increased risk of a generalized crisis; secondly, it assumes that the return on banking asset follows a Gumbel distribution, allowing for better modeling of extreme risks (especially on the left tail) than does a gaussian distribution; thirdly, it analyzes arbitrage in terms of regulatory capital for indivi¬ dual risk vs. systemic risk resulting from diversification. We point out that, in this context, the regulator cannot manage individual and systemic risks with a single instrument. Indeed, diversification allows a bank to reduce its individual risk and therefore, from a micro-prudential perspective, to reduce its level of regulatory capital. However, as this strategy leads to an increase in systemic risk, under the macro-prudential regulation, it should hold more. The prudential micro and macro objectives may thus diverge, and thus require two instruments of regulation. © 2018 Presses de Sciences Po.

Methods: A retrospective review of all ocular samples which resulted in the isolation of MRSA between 1st of January 2013 and 31st of December 2019 at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital. Results: A total of 185 samples taken from the ocular surface were MRSA positive. The majority were MRSA colonisation of the ocular surface obtained as part of an MRSA screen (139/6955 patients screened; 2%). Forty-six represented MRSA infections (46/7904 eye samples; 0.58%), most occurring in older patients the majority of whom had known local or systemic risk factors for colonisation. The most common presentation was conjunctivitis (n = 24), followed by pre-septal cellulitis (n = 9). MRSA infections with the poorest clinical outcomes and the longest inpatient stay, were keratitis (n = 6) and post-operative endophthalmitis (n = 2). Our study demonstrated over 60% resistance to azithromycin, fusidic acid and ciprofloxacin, although resistance to chloramphenicol was uncommon. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that MRSA infections of the eye most commonly manifest as a mild infection, typically conjunctivitis, and are generally non-sight threatening. The majority of presentations occur in the context of known MRSA risk factors and in an older populous. Resistance to chloramphenicol is rare, thus it remains an excellent first line treatment.

After the crisis, policymakers in the United States and abroad developed two different strategies for dealing with nonbank systemic risk. The first strategy seeks to regulate individual nonbank entities that officials designate as being potentially systemically important. The second approach targets financial activities that could create systemic risk, irrespective of the types of firms that engage in those transactions. In the last several years, domestic and international policymakers have come to view these two strategies as substitutes, largely abandoning entity-based designations in favor of activities-based approaches. This Article argues that this trend is deeply misguided because entity- and activities-based approaches are complementary tools that are each essential for effectively regulating nonbank systemic risk. Eliminating an entity-based approach to nonbank systemic risk-either formally or through onerous procedural requirements-would expose the financial system to the same risks that it experienced in 2008 as a result of distress at nonbanks like AIG, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers. This conclusion is especially salient in the United States, where jurisdictional fragmentation undermines the capacity of financial regulators to implement an effective activities-based approach. Significant reforms to the U.S. regulatory framework are necessary, therefore, before an activities-based approach can meaningfully complement domestic entity-based systemic risk regulation. © 2019 University of Southern California.

Consistent with theoretical models, we find that strategy managers trade off these two higher moments when building optimal portfolios. Moreover, these trade-offs depend on the kind of strategy. Our experiments show that the VIX and its conditional variance are the most important factors affecting higher moment risk in the hedge fund industry. They also reveal that the behavior of hedge fund strategies is very asymmetric depending on the phase of the business cycle. In contrast to studies which rely on the mean-variance setting, we find that systemic risk—as measured by the cross-sectional dispersions of higher moments—tends to decrease in the low regime.

Based on this, this paper takes the equity markets of 17 countries around the world from 2007 to 2022 as the research object, measures the volatility spillover effect of global financial markets using R-Vine Copula and the DY spillover index, constructs the volatility spillover network of global financial markets, discovers the spillover and diffusion pattern of global financial market risks, and provides relevant suggestions for systemic risk management. It is found that (1) there are certain aggregation characteristics in the network diffusion of global financial market volatility spillover; (2) developed European countries such as the Netherlands, France, the UK, and Germany are at the center of the network and have a strong influence; (3) Asian countries such as China, Japan, and India are at the periphery of the network; and (4) shocks from crisis events enhance the global financial market volatility spillover effect. Based on the above findings, effective prevention of global financial market risk volatility spillover and network diffusion and reduction in systemic risk need to be carried out in two ways.

In this paper, we simulate this downward spiral phenomenon for the Chinese financial stocks based on a two-layer network structure and aim to identify the influential financial stocks based on their individual induced systemic risks. Our findings show that stock liquidity and the concentration of funds’ holding on stocks play important roles in determining systemically important financial institutions. Our results also confirm the statements of “too-big-to-fail” and “too-interconnected-to-fail” of financial institutions in the Chinese market.

To quantify systemic risk we introduce here the PD model, a dynamic model that combines credit risk techniques with a contagion mechanism on the network of exposures among banks. A potential loss distribution is obtained through a multi-period Monte Carlo simulation that considers the probability of default (PD) of the banks and their tendency of defaulting in the same time interval. A contagion process increases the PD of banks exposed toward distressed counterparties. The systemic risk is measured by statistics of the loss distribution, while the contribution of each node is quantified by the new measures PDRank and PDImpact. We illustrate how the model works on the network of the European Global Systemically Important Banks. For a certain range of the banks' capital and of their assets volatility, our results reveal the emergence of a strong contagion regime where lower default correlation between banks corresponds to higher losses. This is the opposite of the diversification benefits postulated by standard credit risk models used by banks and regulators who could therefore underestimate the capital needed to overcome a period of crisis, thereby contributing to the financial system instability. © 2018 The Author(s).",,article; Monte Carlo method; probability; risk assessment; statistics; quantitative analysis,"Latora, V.; School of Mathematical Sciences, United Kingdom; email: v.latora@qmul.ac.uk",,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,29615684.0,English,Sci.

An institutional mechanism was created under the auspices of the G20 with the purpose to implement a global reform. In the article results of the postcrisis global financial reform are analysed in contingent with review of the evolution of institutional mechanism, which specifics often determined success or its absence in particular directions of the reform. The author selects and reviews three main periods of development of the global financial regulation’s institutional mechanism. In the initial period – the first years after the crisis works were progressing in two directions simultaneously: a) co-ordination of activities of national financial regulatory bodies in coping with the crisis processes and neutralization of its consequences; b) development and reconciliation of major global standards of financial regulation. We can consider that period as successful because crisis processes were overcame in relatively short time, trade and currency wars were also avoided and at the same time international regulatory standards were widely agreed. The second period according to the author’s classification (approx. 2012–2015) – transmission to the implementation of agreed international standards at the national and supranational (EC) levels. That time a range of difficulties and contradictions between leading countries revealed. First of all these problems related to the spheres where the regulations of transnational activities of financial institutions had to be agreed. As the author shows exactly in that time a problem of the so-called asymmetrical sovereignty in the financial policy aggravated. The third period is continuing in the present time. During this period, from the one side, the global financial regulation expands its coverage according to emergence of new challenges, but from the other side the interest to the reform is being loosing and the trend to increase of the independence of the national financial regulators is expanding. So the threat to fragmentation of the international financial markets and revision of already agreed regulatory standards became not illusive. Special attention in the article was paid to analysis of the problem of regulating the shadow banking or non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), which are till now largely outside of the regulatory mandate of the governance bodies. Rapid growth of transactions by the latter, according to the author’s opinion, is a threat to the global financial stability especially taking into account such factors as its close interconnectedness with traditional financial institutions (banks), exposure to the bank-like risks, the wide implementation of financial innovations for making new unregulated products. Investigating new challenges beyond the perimeter of the post-crisis reform the author came to the conclusion that implementation of financial technologies as well as the necessity to take into account ecological and social factors require serious transformation of the global financial system as well as it’s regulation. Taking into account the global nature of new challenges the need for international co-operation of financial regulatory bodies will be continued. © 2019, MGIMO Universty Press.

The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk. © 2021 The Authors",Climate change; Disaster; Risk assessment; Systemic risk,,"ZHAO, X.-F.; Division of Public Policy, China; email: xfzhao@ust.hk",,National Climate Center,16749278,,,,English,Adv.

Box 655906, Dallas, TX  75265, United States","For over two centuries, the municipal (muni) bond market has been a source of systemic risk, which returned early in the Covid-19 downturn when borrowing from securities markets became costly for many private and public entities, and some found it difficult to borrow at all. Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the muni market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent such a calamity, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment-grade state and local government bonds at ratings-based interest rate spreads over the safe OIS benchmark yield. In general, these spreads were initially about 100 basis points above average spreads under more normal market conditions and were later lowered by 50 basis points in August 2020. Despite a modest take-up, our study documents the MLF prevented muni spreads from rising much above those margins (plus a modest 10 basis point fee) and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There were concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could induce moral hazard among borrowers and could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility had lasted too long. Partly for this reason and because the muni market had settled down by yearend 2020, the Treasury terminated the MLF at that time. Future assessments of these downside aspects will help answer the question whether the program's benefits addressed here exceeded its costs. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Central bank policy; Credit policy; Municipal finance; State and local governments,,"Duca, J.V.; Oberlin College, 223 Rice Hall, United States; email: jduca@oberlin.edu",,Academic Press Inc.,08891583,,,,English,J.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent complete or partial interruption of normal breathing due to functional occlusion or collapse of upper airway during sleep that leads to apnea or hypopnea and hypoxia. This causes decrease in the arterial oxygen (O 2 ) saturation and a rise in the carbon dioxide saturation during sleep and results in transient hypoxia and increased vascular resistance in body tissues. OSAHS is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, and many reports showed that OSAHS is one of the systemic risk factors for glaucoma which causes irreversible visual field damage, but lacks a systematic analysis of the relationship between the two. Comprehensive glaucoma evaluation should be recommended in patients with OSAHS.

ZKS, Deltares, Delft, Netherlands","Managing coastal risk at the regional scale requires a prioritization of resources along the shoreline. A transparent and rigorous risk assessment should inform managers and stakeholders in their choices. This requires advances in modelling assessment (e.g., consideration of source and pathway conditions to define the probability of occurrence, nonlinear dynamics of the physical processes, better recognition of systemic impacts and non-economic losses) and open-source tools facilitating stakeholders' engagement in the process. This paper discusses how the Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) has been developed as part of the Resilience Increasing Strategies for Coasts Toolkit (RISC-KIT). The framework provides two levels of analysis. A coastal index approach is first recommended to narrow down the risk analysis to a reduced number of sectors which are subsequently geographically grouped into potential hotspots. For the second level of analysis an integrated modelling approach improves the regional risk assessment of the identified hotspots by increasing the spatial resolution of the hazard modelling by using innovative process-based multi-hazard models, by including generic vulnerability indicators in the impact assessment, and by calculating regional systemic impact indicators. A multi-criteria analysis of these indicators is performed to rank the hotspots and support the stakeholders in their selection. The CRAF has been applied and validated on ten European case studies with only small deviation to areas already recognised as high risk. The flexibility of the framework is essential to adapt the assessment to the specific region characteristics. The involvement of stakeholders is crucial not only to select the hotpots and validate the results, but also to support the collection of information and the valuation of assets at risk. As such, the CRAF permits a comprehensive and systemic risk analysis of the regional coast in order to identify and to select higher risk areas. Yet efforts still need to be amplified in the data collection process, in particular for socio-economic and environmental impacts. © 2017 The Authors",Multi-criteria analysis; Regional assessment; Response approach; Systemic impact,Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Hazards; Losses; Network function virtualization; Open systems; Risk analysis; Risk management; Risks; Integrated modelling approach; Multi Criteria Analysis; Probability of occurrence; Regional assessment; Regional risk assessment; Response approach; Systemic impact; Vulnerability indicators; Risk assessment; coastal zone management; environmental impact assessment; hazard assessment; multicriteria analysis; regional planning; risk assessment; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; storm; vulnerability,"Viavattene, C.; Middlesex University, The Burroughs, Hendon, United Kingdom; email: c.viavattene@mdx.ac.uk",,Elsevier B.V.,03783839,,COEND,,English,Coast.

Research on systemic risk based on multi-layer financial networks is relatively scarce, and studies usually focus on only one type of risk. This paper develops a model of the multi-layer financial network system based on three types of links: firm-bank credit, asset-bank portfolio, and interbank lending, which simulates systemic risk under three risk sources: firm credit default, asset depreciation, and bank bankruptcy. The impact of the multi-layer financial network structure, default risk threshold, and bank asset allocation strategy is further explored. It has been shown that the larger the risk shock, the greater the systemic risk under different risk sources, and the risk propagation cycle tends to rise and then decline. As centralized nodes in the multi-layer financial network system, bank nodes may play both blocking and propagation roles under different risk sources. Furthermore, the multi-layer financial network system is most susceptible to bank bankruptcy risk, followed by firm credit default risk. Further research indicates that increasing the average degree of firms in the bank–firm credit network, the density of the bank-asset portfolio network, and the bank capital adequacy ratio all contribute to reducing systemic risk under the three risk sources. Additionally, the more assets a bank holds in a single market, the more vulnerable it is to the risks associated with that market. © 2022 by the author.",multi-agent; multi-layer financial network; systemic risk,,"Gao, Q.; School of Financial Technology, China; email: gaoqianqian@lixin.edu.cn",,MDPI,10994300,,,,English,Entropy,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138541032,scopus

The first model, Mass Payment Accounts, which is related to virtual accounts rather than to virtual IBANs, is the model where the licensed financial institution only provides a business payment (settlement) account, with technical subaccounts, to one of their business clients. The functionality of the subaccounts is limited to reflect and distinguish the incoming payments. The second and more complex model is the vIBAN solution, where the licensed payment institution provides, to another licensed financial institution, indirect access to local payment schemes (hereinafter referred to as “vIBAN”). To confirm the legal validity and identify the potential risks of vIBAN services, EU law was analysed with some insights from Polish law. The reason for introducing vIBAN services is the difficulty for certain payment service providers to participate in so-called designated payment systems. Designated payment systems are usually the most widespread local payment systems. The reason for the different treatment of these designated systems is banking systemic risk, understood as a situation where a default by a system participant may result in a default by other participants. Consequently, even if a given payment service provider can obtain its own IBAN number, there is often no possibility for it to participate in designated payment schemes. Bearing in mind the different rules in the case of designated payment systems, the legality of vIBAN services in the EU law is justified by the principle of free movement of services, the principle of equal access to payment schemes and the obligation of the credit institutions to provide banking and non-banking participants with credit institution payment account services on an objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate basis. However, there are various challenges related to the functioning of vIBAN services, such as the overlapping of certain AML/CFT obligations, enforcement of administrative and court seizures, AML-related blocking of vIBANs and consistency of money transfer sender data with the Fund Transfer Regulation. The most pressing challenges requiring prompt regulation on the European level are related to the applicable deposit protection scheme, as well as to specific Member States’ administrative restrictions, which can cause difficulties in offering vIBAN services to business entities. © 2022 by the author.",BaaS; banking services; banking-as-a-service; open banking; payment schemes; payment services; PSD2; vIBAN; virtual account; virtual IBAN; white label banking,,"Grabowski, M.; Banking and Finance, Poland; email: michalgrabowski@kpmg.pl",,MDPI,19118074,,,,English,J.

Lessons and their implications are used to describe a climate resilience research renewal agenda. Three key lessons are identified. The first lesson is generic, that climate change risk coexists and interacts with other risks through overlapping social processes, conditions and decision-making contexts. Two further lessons are urban specific: that networks of connectivity bring risk as well as resilience and that overcrowding is a key indicator of the multiple determinants of vulnerability to both COVID-19 and climate change impacts. From these lessons three research priorities arise: dynamic and compounding vulnerability, systemic risk and risk root cause analysis. These connected agendas identify affordable and healthy housing, social cohesion, minority and local leadership and multiscale governance as entry points for targeted research that can break cycles of multiple risk creation and so build back better for climate change as well as COVID-19 in recovery and renewal. © 2021 The Author(s).

Methodology A cross-sectional observational study was performed on patients diagnosed with MetS and compared to normal controls. All patients underwent ophthalmic and anthropometric examination, serological and biochemical blood investigations; and ocular imaging using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Patients with ocular pathology were excluded. Unpaired t-test was used to compare mean thickness between the two groups. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to compare mean thickness between different tertiles of MetS parameters, and a generalized estimating equation was used to correct for inter-eye correlation and to assess association between mean thickness and covariates. Results Two hundred and forty-eight eyes from 124 participants (1:1 ratio of MetS patients to controls) were included. Age ranged between 30 to 50 years old, and mean age was 40 ± 6.6 years. RNFL thickness was lower globally (93.6 ± 9.9 μm vs 99.0 ± 9.3, p<0.001) and in the inferior (124.5 ± 17.5 μm vs 131.0 ± 16.4 μm, p = 0.002), superior (117.2 ± 16.0 μm vs 126.3 ± 14.4 μm, p<0.001) and temporal (65.5 ± 10.2 μm vs 69.5 ± 9.8, p = 0.002) sectors in MetS patients compared to controls. Only the central (237.0 ± 14.0 μm vs 243.6 ± 18.0 μm, p = 0.002) and inferior parafoveal (307.8 ± 20.9 vs 314.6 ± 14.6, p = 0.004) area of the macula was significantly thinner. The inferior RNFL sector had the most difference (mean difference = 9.1 μm). The Generalized Estimating Equation found that, after adjusting for age, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, HDL and obesity; the number of MetS components and elevated triglyceride levels were independent risk factors for reduced thickness in global RNFL (β = -4.4, 95% CI = -7.29 to -1.5, p = 0.003) and inferior parafovea (β = -6.85, 95% CI = -11.58 to -2.13, p = 0.004) thickness respectively. Conclusion RNFL thinning was seen more than macula thinning in MetS patients, suggesting RNFL susceptibility to neurodegeneration than the macula. A higher number of metabolic components and elevated triglyceride levels were independent risk factors for retinal thinning in this group of patients. Copyright: © 2021 New et al.

The sample consists of banks from Central and Eastern Europe with large share of FX exposures on the balance sheet. Empirical findings indicate that systemic risk is dependent on the currency choice of financial institutions. While FX positions denominating in EUR and USD do not pose systemic risk concerns, FX positions denominating in exotic currencies like CHF significantly enhance the banks’ systemic importance. The negative influence of CHF positions might be reduced through prudent corporate governance mechanisms, tight restrictions on banking activity, and more restrictive limits on foreign currency lending in the home countries of the bank holding companies. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",foreign currency assets; foreign currency liabilities; governance; Swiss franc; systemic risk,banking; currency; governance approach; lending behavior; Central Europe; Eastern Europe,"Andrieş, A.M.; Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Teodor Mihali Street, Nr. 58-60, Romania; email: simona.mutu@econ.ubbcluj.ro",,Routledge,00128775,,,,English,East.

Conducting efficient analysis of big data has become an important topic. Machine learning is one of the commonly used methods for data analysis. The traditional machine learning algorithm is often designed as the way of offline batch training. However, this method is not suitable for data sets with massive scale and continuous growth in the big data environment. Transforming the traditional machine learning algorithm so that it can better apply to the big data environment has become a research hotspot. With the rapid development of economy and society and the continuous progress of science and technology, the public's understanding of ocean functions is gradually deepened, the demand for marine products and services is increasing every day, and the economic and social benefits of the ocean are continuously rising. In this context, great importance should be given to the examination of marine resources and environment, the development and utilization of work, the constant adjusting of the ocean economic development policy, and the variety of comprehensive marine management measures to ensure the sustainable development of implementation of marine programs.

Methods: Preterm infants born ≤ 2000 grams birth weight (BW) and/or ≤ 34 weeks gestational age (GA) undergoing ROP screening were enrolled prospectively. Visual acuity was recorded using Teller Acuity Cards. Contrast threshold was measured with Newborn Contrast Cards at first screening visit and at the end of ROP screening at 40 weeks of postmenstrual age or older. Results: Of the 173 study infants, 134 (77.5%) did not have any stage of ROP. Of the remaining 39 (22.5%), 34 (87%) had type 2 ROP and 5 (13%) had type 1 ROP requiring treatment. The mean contrast threshold at the first visit of the no ROP type 1 and type 2 groups was 0.36 ± 0.07, 0.65 ± 0.19, and 0.46 ± 0.09, respectively (P < 0.001). Contrast threshold had a significant correlation with BW (R =−0.291, P = < 0.001) and gestational age (R =−0.47, P = < 0.001). The contrast threshold at the first visit correlated with visual acuity measured at 3 months of corrected age in logMAR (R = 0.36, P = 0.01). Other than BW and GA, no other systemic risk factors correlated with contrast threshold measured at the first screening visit. Conclusions: Newborn Contrast Cards are a viable tool to test contrast threshold in preterm infants. The association between contrast threshold and ROP, and its correlation with visual acuity, suggest that contrast threshold measurement may help predict the clinical vision outcome among prematurely born infants. Translational Relevance: Contrast threshold measurement may prove to be a useful tool in the estimation of visual potential in preterm infants. © 2021 The Authors.",Contrast threshold; Infants; Retinopathy of prematurity; Screening; Teller Acuity Cards; Visual acuity; Wide-field imaging,Article; birth weight; child; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; contrast sensitivity; cycloplegic refraction; eye refraction; female; follow up; gestational age; human; infant; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; nonhuman; observational study; pilot study; prematurity; prospective study; refraction error; retrolental fibroplasia; risk factor; visual acuity; visual system examination,"Vinekar, A.; Department of Pediatric Retina, India; email: anandvinekar@yahoo.com",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,21642591,,,,English,Translational Vis.

Characteristics and pathobiology of vulnerable plaques prone to plaque rupture have been studied extensively over 2 decades in humans using optical coherence tomography (OCT), an intravascular imaging technique with micron scale resolution. OCT studies have identified key features of plaque vulnerability and described the in vivo characteristics and spatial distribution of thin cap fibroatheromas as major precursors to plaque rupture. In addition, OCT data supports the evolving understanding of coronary heart disease as a panvascular process associated with inflammation. In the setting of high atherosclerotic burden, plaque ruptures often occur at multiple sites in the coronary arteries, and plaque progression and healing are dynamic processes modulated by systemic risk factors.

Based on daily interest rate data of representative bond categories, this study conducted a dynamic analysis based on generalized vector autoregressive volatility spillover variance decomposition, constructed a complex network, and adopted the minimum spanning tree method to clarify and analyze the risk propagation path between different bond types. It is found that the importance of each bond type is positively correlated with liquidity, transaction volume, and credit rating, and the inter-bank market is the most important market in the entire bond market, while interest rate bonds, bank bonds and urban investment bonds are important varieties with great systemic importance. In addition, the long-term trend of the dynamic spillover index of China’s bond market falls in line with the pace of the interest rate adjustments. To hold the bottom line of preventing financial systemic risks of China’s bond market, standard management, strict supervision, and timely regulation of the bond markets are required, and the structural entropy, as a useful indicator, also should be used in the risk management and monitoring. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to compare and analyze systemic and serum risk factors for nAMD and PCV in an aging Chinese population. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 108 patients with nAMD, 131 patients with PCV, and 219 control subjects. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein B (APOB), complement 3 (C3), and complement 4 (C4) together with data on systemic risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and asthma, were collected. Chi-square tests, independent-samples t tests, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of risk factors with nAMD and PCV. Results: Patients with PCV and those with nAMD were likely to have hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001). CAD (P = 0.020) and hypertension (P = 0.006) correlated significantly with nAMD and PCV, respectively. Although no association of age and asthma with PCV or nAMD was found (P > 0.05), DM was associated with PCV development (OR = 0.535, P = 0.044). Regarding serum risk factors, HDL, LDL, TG, APOB, and C3 were significantly associated with nAMD (OR < 0.001, P < 0.001; OR = 0.028, P < 0.001; OR = 0.175, P < 0.001; OR = 0.922, P = 0.022; OR < 0.001, P < 0.001) and PCV (OR = 0.001, P = 0.001; OR = 0.097, P = 0.003; OR = 0.410, P = 0.037; OR = 0.895, P = 0.001; OR = 0.001, P < 0.001). Compared with nAMD, higher levels of HDL (P = 0.003) and LDL (P = 0.016) and lower levels of TG (P = 0.039) were found in patients with PCV, but the association of systemic risk factors between the two diseases was not significant (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that hyperlipidemia is significantly associated with both nAMD and PCV. Serum lipid and complement levels have an effect on the pathogenesis of nAMD and PCV, and consideration of the differences between systemic and serum risk factors should be taken into account in clinical management. © 2023, The Author(s).",Age-related macular degeneration; Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; Risk factors,apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein B; complement component C3; complement component C4; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adult; age related macular degeneration; aged; aging; Article; asthma; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; dilated fundus examination; eye examination; female; fluorescein fundus angiography; fluorescence angiography; genetic susceptibility; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; indocyanine green angiography; lipid blood level; major clinical study; male; optical coherence tomography; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; retrospective study; risk factor; serum risk factor; slit lamp microscopy; systemic risk factor; visual acuity,"Huang, L.; Department of Ophthalmology, China; email: huanglzh@pkuph.edu.cn

Using the Conditional Value-at-risk approach (ΔCoVaR) risk metric, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (Structural Vector Autoregression with Stochastic Volatility model [SV-TVP-SAVR]) model, and the generalized forecast error variance decomposition (Tvpdy) model, this paper discusses how financial leverage volatility shocks fintech sectoral risks and the evolution of the risk within fintech under the shocks on the basis of the classification criteria of the Chinese fintech enterprise database and daily trading data of A-share listed companies. The statistical results show that financial leverage volatility causes risk changes across fintech sectors, which is especially significant during economic downturns or government interventions. Also, under the shock of financial leverage volatility, the fintech sectors will absorb or diffuse risks outward through spillover channels, with significant differences in the risk spillover conditions of different types of sectors. Finally, the fintech sector can produce a contagion system with the Internet consumer finance, payment, and Internet microcommercial credit sectors as the core of risks, resulting in a systemic risk crisis.

Practices to reduce the impacts on the health and well-being of populations must evolve from a reactive mode to preventive, proactive and concerted actions beginning at individual and community levels. Experiences and lessons learned from the pandemic will help to better prevent and reduce the psychosocial impacts of floods, or other hydroclimatic risks, in a climate change context. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper first describes the complexity and the challenges associated with climate change and systemic risks. It also presents some systemic frameworks of mental health determinants, and provides an overview of the different types of psychosocial impacts of disasters. Through various Quebec case studies and using lessons learned from past and recent flood-related events, recommendations are made on how to better integrate individual and community factors in disaster response. Findings: Results highlight the fact that people who have been affected by the events are significantly more likely to have mental health problems than those not exposed to flooding. They further demonstrate the adverse and long-term effects of floods on psychological health, notably stemming from indirect stressors at the community and institutional levels. Different strategies are proposed from individual-centered to systemic approaches, in putting forward the advantages from intersectoral and multirisk researches and interventions. Originality/value: The establishment of an intersectoral flood network, namely the InterSectoral Flood Network of Québec (RIISQ), is presented as an interesting avenue to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and a systemic view of flood risks. Intersectoral work is proving to be a major issue in the management of systemic risks, and should concern communities, health and mental health professionals, and the various levels of governance. As climate change is called upon to lead to more and more systemic risks, close collaboration between all the areas concerned with the management of the factors of vulnerability and exposure of populations will be necessary to respond effectively to damages and impacts (direct and indirect) linked to new meteorological and compound hazards. This means as well to better integrate the communication managers into the risk management team. © 2022, Anne-Sophie Gousse-Lessard, Philippe Gachon, Lily Lessard, Valérie Vermeulen, Maxime Boivin, Danielle Maltais, Elsa Landaverde, Mélissa Généreux, Bernard Motulsky and Julien Le Beller.",Climate change; Climate risks; Health consequences; Intersectoral approaches; Psychosocial impacts; Systemic risks,,"Gousse-Lessard, A.-S.; Institut des sciences de l'environnement, Canada; email: gousse-lessard.anne-sophie@uqam.ca",,Emerald Publishing,09653562,,,,English,Disaster Prev.

At present, quantitative research on the macroprudential regulation for the dynamic Chinese banking network system is lacking, while the related studies in other countries have not considered the interbank network structure. Therefore, in the present paper, we construct a dynamic banking network model with a scale-free network and a dynamic macroprudential regulation model under four risk allocation mechanisms (CVaR, Incremental VaR, Shapley value EL, and ΔCoVaR) for the dynamic Chinese banking network system. Then, we conduct empirical research to study the effect of the macroprudential regulation model on the Chinese banking network system. Our results show that the Chinese banking network system was the most unstable in 2010 and that the average default probability decreased every year after the macroprudential regulation, indicating the effectiveness of the macroprudential regulation model. From the perspective of the scale-free network structure, we find that the intrinsic mechanism of macroprudential regulation is to rewire the interbank linkages from small banks to large banks with more interbank lending to prevent contagious risk, thereby improving the stability of the entire banking system. Moreover, the regulation effects of ΔCoVaR and CVaR mechanisms are found to be better than those of the other mechanisms. The regulation effect of ΔCoVaR is the most significant. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Chinese banking network system; Macroprudential regulation; Risk allocation mechanism; Scale-free network; Systemic risk,,"Fan, H.; Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, China; email: HongFan@dhu.edu.cn",,Springer,1860711X,,,,English,J.

With patients living longer due to advances in care, optimal surgical and radiation options for treating spinal metastases are paramount to preserving quality of life in these individuals. A multidisciplinary approach to managing these patients involving interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, and plastic surgeons, among others, has demonstrated enormous benefits in preventing and managing complications. Preoperative attention to vascular blood supply, dosing constraints, and systemic risk factors for hemorrhage and infection can help reduce the occurrence of complications. Similarly, intraoperative adjuncts such as cement augmentation, body warmers, radiofrequency cauterization devices, and intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring can also mitigate surgical and hardware-related complications. Each patient should ultimately be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for the ideal treatment strategy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore the problem of interbank networks reconstruction using limited data is of large importance. Nevertheless, algorithms available are often computationally complex and require several rounds of simulation for finding the best configuration. In this research we suggest an algorithm of interbank network properties reconstruction based on building the bow-tie structure and regulation of other topological properties by the change in sizes of bow-tie components.

Despite the fact that emboli to the ophthalmic artery (OA) and middle cerebral artery share the internal carotid artery (ICA) as a common origin or transit for emboli, the asymmetry in their final destination has not been fully explained. We hypothesize that the anatomic location of the OA takeoff from the ICA may contribute to the differential flow of small emboli to the retinal circulation vs the cerebral circulation. METHODS: We report a retrospective, comparative, case-control study on 28 patients with retinal ischemia and 26 patients with TIA or cerebral infarction caused by embolic events. All subjects underwent either computed tomography angiography or MRA. The location of the ipsilateral OA origin off the ICA was then graded in a blinded fashion and compared between cohorts. Vascular risk factors were collected for all patients, including age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and smoking. RESULTS: We find that in patients with retinal ischemia of embolic etiology, the ipsilateral OA takeoff from the ICA is more proximal than in patients with cerebral infarcts or TIA (P = 0.0002). We found no statistically significant differences in demographic, vascular, or systemic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the mean anatomical location of the OA takeoff from the ICA is significantly more proximal in patients with MVL due to retinal ischemia compared with patients with TIA or cerebral ischemia. This finding contributes significantly to our understanding of a long observed but poorly understood phenomenon that patients with MVL are less likely to have concurrent cerebral ischemia than are patients with TIA.

Design: An observational study. Participants: Twenty-two patients (20 men and 2 women) with treatment-naïve unilateral CSC and 28 normal eyes of 28 age-matched, healthy participants (21 men and 7 women). Methods: We performed enhanced depth imaging of swept-source (SS) OCT with a viewing angle of vertical 20 mm × horizontal 23 mm. Moreover, we developed a grid consisting of 9 subfields, with diameters of 3, 9, and 18 mm; the inner and outer rings were enclosed by circles with diameters of 3 and 9 mm and 9 and 18 mm, respectively, which were divided into 4 subfields—superotemporal, inferotemporal, superonasal, and inferonasal. Main Outcome Measures: Widefield changes in choroidal thickness. Results: The mean duration from the presumed onset of CSC was 6.8 ± 3.1 months during the examination. Compared with that in normal eyes, the choroidal thickness in eyes of patients with CSC was significantly greater in all subfields (P < 0.020 for fellow eyes; P < 0.001 for eyes with CSC). Compared with that in fellow eyes, the choroidal thicknesses in eyes of patients with CSC were significantly greater, except for the outer superotemporal and inferonasal subfields (P < 0.001 for all inner subfields; P < 0.001 for the outer superonasal and inferotemporal subfields). In areas with dilated vortex veins, choroidal thickening was observed from the vicinity of the vortex vein ampulla to the macula along the course of the veins. Choroidal thickening on the dominant side was significantly greater than that on the nondominant side (P = 0.015 for the nasal subfield of the inner ring; P = 0.003 and P < 0.001 for the temporal subfields of the inner and outer rings, respectively). Conclusions: Enhanced depth imaging of SS-OCT facilitated the analysis of WF changes in choroidal thickness in both healthy patients and patients with CSC. The local factors of the affected vortex vein and systemic risk factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of CSC. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology",Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC); Enhanced depth imaging (EDI); Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT); Widefield (WF),"vasculotropin; Article; artificial intelligence; autofluorescence; best corrected visual acuity; central serous retinopathy; choroidal thickness; clinical article; female; fluorescence angiography; glaucoma; human; hypotension; indocyanine green angiography; laser coagulation; male; normal human; observational study; optical coherence tomography; outcome assessment; perimetry; retinal pigment epithelium; subretinal neovascularization; swept source optical coherence tomography; visual acuity; central serous retinopathy; choroid; optical coherence tomography; pathology; procedures; retina macula lutea; Central Serous Chorioretinopathy; Choroid; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Humans; Macula Lutea; Male; Tomography, Optical Coherence","Muraoka, Y.; Department of Ophthalmology, Kyoto, Japan; email: muraoka@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp",,Elsevier Inc.,24686530,,,35436598.0,English,Ophthalmol.

We divide an economy into agents that interact via flow of funds and express the financial instability level of each agent as a function of time derivatives of its wealth, cash inflows, and borrowing capacity. We show that among these factors, the borrowing capacity, which is determined by other economic constraints, has the largest impact on financial instability. It is suggested that borrowing capacity limitations could even cause contagion through feedback loop formed by flow of funds. We use historical time series of the integrated macroeconomic accounts of the United Stated from 1960 to 2017 to verify our conjecture by quantifying the financial instability levels of the agents under different levels of borrowing capacity and how they affect one another during the period of the subprime mortgage crisis.

The level of credit risk connectedness among sovereigns, which is quite high, is comparable to the connectedness among stock markets and foreign exchange markets. In the aftermath of the recent financial crises that originated in developed countries, emerging market countries have played a crucial role in the transmission of sovereign credit risk, while developed countries and debt-ridden developing countries have played marginal roles. Secondary regressions show that both trade and capital flows are important determinants of pairwise connectedness across countries. The capital flows became increasingly important after 2013, while the effect of trade flows decreased during the crisis and did not recover afterwards. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Lasso; Network estimation; Sovereign credit risk; Systemic risk; Variance decomposition; Vector autoregression,,"Yilmaz, K.; Koç University, Rumelifeneri Yolu, Turkey; email: kyilmaz@ku.edu.tr",,Elsevier B.V.,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

This direct transfer of systemic risk was made possible by phenomena such as contagion and common shocks. The way in which these elements of interconnectedness can magnify seemingly small levels of systemic risk, and subsequently transfer between financial sectors illustrate the necessity for a more in-depth analysis. This measurement is done using three approaches. A dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model is used to investigate contagion. To analyse the volatility spillover effect from the US to SA, an exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (EGARCH) model is employed. Finally, a new contribution is made where a marginal expected shortfall (MES) model is used to set the FTSE/JSE All-Share Index (ALSI) as a hypothetical bank in the financial sector of the S&P 500. All approaches show weak evidence for a direct systemic risk transfer and therefore indicate that any systemic risk transfer is more likely to take an indirect form through changes in capital flows or interest rates. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",banks; contagion; DCC; EGARCH; MES; Systemic risk; volatility,banking; capital flow; correlation; financial crisis; financial services; interest rate; regression analysis; spillover effect; South Africa; United States,"Foggitt, G.M.; Department of Risk Management, Potchefstroom Campus, Hoffman Street, South Africa; email: Gregmf90@gmail.com",,Routledge,00036846,,,,English,Appl.

Nevertheless, very few of these approaches address systemic risks, particularly in multi-hazard environments, and thus do not holistically contribute to decision making in various contexts. This paper addresses this gap by means of a critical review and an assessment of approaches to climate and disaster resilience measurement with a particular focus on three issues: (1) the consideration of compounding socioeconomic and climatic risks in approaches to resilience measurement; (2) the methodological and technical aspects of resilience measurement; and (3) the application and practicability of resilience measurement across various contexts to reliably inform decision-making processes. Seventeen key resilience measurement approaches developed by researchers, government, and private and civil society organizations are selected and evaluated according to a set of assessment criteria. Based on this assessment, we conclude with three key findings. First, we find a lack of clear standards and validated approaches in the measurement methodologies, which can lead to inconsistencies and poor data comparability. Second, approaches to resilience measurement should further strive to combine both process- and outcome-based methodological perspectives to represent resilience in the most holistic and standardized manner possible. Third, in the context of multiple hazards, decision-making strategies should address multiple vulnerabilities. To conclude, we suggest that future developments in resilience measurement should allow for the analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales and among systemic risks. Moreover, more rigorous process-based approaches to resilience measurement are still required that can incorporate outputs into decision making. © 2022",Climate; Comprehensive risk management; Decision support; Multiple hazard; Resilience measurement; Review,,"Laurien, F.; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)Austria; email: laurien@iiasa.ac.at",,Elsevier B.V.,22120963,,,,English,Clim.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling residents using a validated self-assessment as part of comprehensive health screening. Methods: The data were derived from comprehensive health screening (PORI75) for older adults of 75 years living in Western Finland in 2020 and 2021. One of 30 validated measures in health screening focused on identifying medication-related risk factors (LOTTA Checklist). The Checklist items were divided into (1) systemic risk factors (10 items) and (2) potentially drug-induced symptoms (10 items). Polypharmacy was categorized according to the number of used drugs: (1) no polypharmacy (<5 drugs), (2) polypharmacy (≥5 and <10), and (3) excessive polypharmacy (≥10). The linearity across these three polypharmacy groups was evaluated using the Cochran–Armitage test. Results: Altogether, 1024 out of 1094 residents who participated in the health screening consented to this study (n = 569 in 2020 and n = 459 in 2021). The mean number of all drugs in use was 7.0 (range 0−26; SD 4.1), with 71% of the residents using >5 drugs, that is, having polypharmacy. Of the systemic risk factors most common was that the resident had more than one physician responsible for the treatment (48% of the residents), followed by missing drug list (43%), missing regular monitoring (35%), and unclear durations of the medication (35%). The most experienced potentially drug-induced symptoms were self-reported constipation (21%), urinating problems (20%), and unusual tiredness (17%). An increasing number of drugs in use, particularly excessive polypharmacy, was associated with various medication-related risk factors. Conclusion: As a part of comprehensive health screening the LOTTA Checklist provides useful information to prevent medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling older adults. The Checklist could be used to guide planning and implementing health services in the future. © 2023 The Authors.

The debt dynamics equation for public debt uses two components for the analysis of public debt sustainability, namely, interest rate–growth rate differential and differential of primary budget balance-to-GDP and change of reserve money-to-GDP ratio. The equation for external debt dynamics also uses two components for the assessment of external debt sustainability, namely, current account balance-to-exports ratio and differential of exports growth and interest rate. The significance of the approach used in the current study lies in the fact that in case of evaluation of countries’ debt sustainability, it is quite necessary to monitor debt trends along with emerging domestic and external vulnerabilities and systemic risks that threaten debt sustainability. This phenomenon has been captured through debt dynamics approach, which is used in the current study. The results are based on the estimation of two equations, namely, debt dynamics equation for overall public debt sustainability and debt dynamics equation for external debt sustainability. The results of the study indicate that primary budget deficit and current account deficit have played a significant role in the accumulation of public debt and external debt, respectively in Pakistan and India.

Here, we use the agent-based approach to study capital regulation and its implications on the evolution of the banking system. We chose the Russian banking system to proxy key model parameters. We find that lower capital requirements imply higher financial stability than the Basel III regime, where the regulator requires banks to have capital over 10% of its risk-weighted assets’ amount. However, the regulatory rule to merely have a non-negative capital is the simplest solution that best fits heterogeneous economies. It produces the highest ratio of capital to assets, the least number of bank bankruptcies, and the lowest demand of banks to enter the interbank market to cover liquidity problems for all systems. © Operational Research Society 2019.",Agent-based model; Basel; capital adequacy ratio; capital regulation,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Laws and legislation; Online systems; Risk assessment; Simulation platform; Agent-based approach; Agent-based model; Banking regulations; Capital requirements; Financial stability; Interbank market; Interest rate spread; Regulatory rules; Banking,"Leonidov, A.; P.N.Lebedev Physical InstituteRussian Federation; email: Leonidov@lpi.ru",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,17477778,,,,English,J.

The established financial systemic risk measurement method can identify risks to a certain extent, deeply understand the nature, root and key areas of systemic financial risks, and build a long-term mechanism to prevent and resolve systemic financial risks. © 2022 IEEE.",Financial risks; Fuzzy clustering; Risk assessment,Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Economic and social effects; Finance; Industrial economics; Quality control; Risk assessment; Economic development; Financial industry; Financial risk prevention; Financial risks; Fuzzy Cluster Analysis; Industry risks; Risk prevention and controls; Risks assessments; Systemic risks; Well-off societies; Fuzzy clustering,"Luo, D.; NWS Asset Management Co., Hainan, China; email: luodenan@sina.com",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781665492737,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

We quantify systemic risk as possible risk spillovers from individual firms to the economy by taking into account time-varying linkages between the firm and the economy. Based on a novel dataset that combines data on international trade and foreign direct investments with daily stock data for 67 Dutch listed companies from 2006–2015, our results indicate that high systemic risk contributions are not only present in the financial sector, but also occur in other sectors of the economy. We find that firms within the financial sector are more capable than non-financial firms of reverting to their pre-financial crisis level of systemic risk contribution. Having examined the potential role globalization fulfills in determining systemic risk, we find two main opposing effects. First, firms in internationally trade-intensive sectors contribute less to systemic risk than firms in sectors with low trade intensity. Second, systemic risk rises when firms are engaged in foreign direct investment activity, suggesting that international networks and global supply chains contribute to systemic risk propagation. Our empirical results imply that macro-prudential policy aimed at monitoring systemic risk should be extended to non-financial sectors and should take into consideration globalization measures, such as foreign direct investments and global supply chains. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Delta conditional value-at-risk; Foreign direct investments; Globalization; International trade; Systemic risk,,"Van Cauwenberge, A.; Faculty of Business Economics, Martelarenlaan 42, Belgium; email: annelies.vancauwenberge@uhasselt.be",,Elsevier B.V.,02649993,,,,English,Econ.

This paper adopts Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered epidemical model and sets supervision stringency as the principal parameter. The model was formed by a differential equation set and financial system are set with Susceptible group, Exposed group, Infectious A, Infectious B, and Removed group. Based on the theoretical research, this paper gave the steady-state solution and the robust conditions for equilibrium. The conclusion is that in a short time, a small portion of Susceptible group and Exposed group will become Removed group, while a big portion rapidly becomes Infectious A, B. The rate and quantity of other institutions infected is much higher than systematically important financial institutions. Meanwhile, it is known that enhancing supervision stringency is instrumental in alleviating risk spill-over effect of other institutions and risk contagion among institutions. Under system equilibrium, the number of infectious institutions gradually decreases with supervision stringency increasing. Furthermore, the appropriate enhancement of supervision stringency can avoid risk eruption, whereas risk contagion could outbreak if supervision was overstringent. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

I introduce a new systemic importance measure based on the harmonic distance of Acemoglu, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi from 2015. Then, motivated by their theoretical results for concentration centrality in a later work of the same year, I compare this measure with well-known centrality measures that have already been applied in the systemic risk literature, and that do not take into account the structure of a contagion mechanism. I derive an explicit formula of size-adjusted harmonic distances and extend it by using liquid assets for a heterogeneous banking system. The simulation results on extended Barabási–Albert-type networks and complete networks do not confirm that these new measures would perform better than “off-the-shelf” centralities, but a linear combination of these measures forecasts losses better than any of the individual measures. The time variations of centrality measures are presented in an interbank network. I also test for the scale-free property of the Hungarian interbank-lending network and suggest that network measures be used as systemic risk indicators in systemic stress indexes. Finally, this work points out that, in some cases, the application of centrality measures might be misleading, and specific clearing algorithms provide more reliable results. © Infopro Digital Limited 2018.

Instead, optimal regulatory solutions often blend the expertise and adaptability of private-sector influence with the stabilizing effects of federal oversight. This collaborative framework has a rich history in U.S. derivatives regulation, which has long relied on self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) like exchanges, clearinghouses, and the National Futures Association to help promote market stability and customer protection. SROs remain subject to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), which guards against the proverbial fox-in-the-henhouse scenario while advancing quintessential government functions like mitigating systemic risk. The advantages of this self-regulatory framework were underscored in 2020, when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spurred unprecedented volatility across U.S. derivatives markets. Effectively navigating the market effects of the pandemic required a calibrated approach that drew from the advantages of SROs and the CFTC.

Against this background, it explores the growing environmental conflicts involving water resources in Brazil, including the Amazon region. In addition to the introduction and conclusion, the paper is structured around three topics. The first one outlines how the concept of public security has evolved to the present state, in which climate change is taken into account. Next, climate change is discussed as a factor that magnifies vulnerabilities, an argument supported by a discussion of historical events. The third topic highlights the main threats, vulnerabilities and conflicts involving water resources in Brazil, taking a scientific view of systemic risks and precaution. Finally, we propose rethinking the concept of public security in Brazil from a perspective of parameters involving regulations, principles and state initiative. The article suggests that the immediate and future effects of climate change do have a profound impact on social systems and on the environment, and may be a triggering factor of public insecurity. If institutions and governments do not address existing effects, and invest in adaptations to meet future scientific forecasts on climate change, social stability and the development of a culture of peace will be less likely in Brazil. A fundamental step in this process is the reformulation of the conventional concept of public security in the Brazilian legislation, in order to expressly incorporate the variable of climate security among its stated objectives. In addition, we point out a set of actions and principles with the potentital to promote not only adaptation and resilience, but also contribute to building peace. In terms of methodology, the study is descriptive, exploratory, legislative, bibliographical and documentary. © 2021 - IOS Press.

First, we find that the constructed copula models can address the asymmetry of stock market systemic risk spillover and the characteristics of co-movement with better tail dependence estimation. Second, there is an obvious risk spillover effect between the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) and Shenzhen Component Index (SZEC). Due to the development of two connect programs, systemic risk can spread quickly from the Hang Seng Index (HSI) to SSEC and SZEC. Third, since the structure and participants of Chinese stock market, all macroeconomic variables make strongly positive and significant nonlinear impact on ΔCoVaR and exhibit significant non-symmetric characteristics in the long- and short-term perspectives, especially for EPU.

AI in agriculture could improve crop management and agricultural productivity through plant phenotyping, rapid diagnosis of plant disease, efficient application of agrochemicals and assistance for growers with location-relevant agronomic advice. However, the ramifications of machine learning (ML) models, expert systems and autonomous machines for farms, farmers and food security are poorly understood and under-appreciated. Here, we consider systemic risk factors of AI in agriculture. Namely, we review risks relating to interoperability, reliability and relevance of agricultural data, unintended socio-ecological consequences resulting from ML models optimized for yields, and safety and security concerns associated with deployment of ML platforms at scale. As a response, we suggest risk-mitigation measures, including inviting rural anthropologists and applied ecologists into the technology design process, applying frameworks for responsible and human-centred innovation, setting data cooperatives for improved data transparency and ownership rights, and initial deployment of agricultural AI in digital sandboxes. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.",,Crops; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Productivity; Risk assessment; Agricultural productivity; Artificial intelligence technologies; Autonomous machines; Crop managements; Food security; Machine learning models; Plant disease; Plant phenotyping; Risk factors; Systemic risks; Ecology,"Tzachor, A.; Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, United Kingdom; email: at875@cam.ac.uk

We propose a market clustering measure using granular trading data. For each stock, the clustering measure captures the degree of trading overlap among any two investors in that stock, based on a comparison with the expected crowding in a null model where trades are maximally random while still respecting the empirical heterogeneity of both stocks and investors. We investigate the effect of crowded trades on stock price stability and present evidence that market clustering has a causal effect on the properties of the tails of the stock return distribution, particularly the positive tail, even after controlling for commonly considered risk drivers. Reduced investor pool diversity could thus negatively affect stock price stability. © 2021 by the authors.

Commercial CI/CD platforms provide services for specifying and running CI/CD actions. However, they present a security risk in their own right, given their privileged access to secrets, infrastructure, and ability to fetch and execute arbitrary code. In this paper, we study the security of the newly popular GitHub CI platform. We first identify four fundamental security properties that must hold for any CI/CD system: Admittance Control, Execution Control, Code Control, and Access to Secrets. We then examine if GitHub CI enforces these properties in comparison with the other five popular CI/CD platforms. We perform a comprehensive analysis of 447,238 workflows spanning 213,854 GitHub repositories. We made several disturbing observations. Our analysis shows that 99.8% of workflows are overprivileged and have read-write access (instead of read-only) to the repository. In addition, 23.7% of workflows are triggerable by a pull_request and use code from the underlying repository. An attacker can exploit these workflows and execute arbitrary code as part of the workflow. Due to the modular nature of workflows, we find that 99.7% of repositories in our dataset execute some externally developed plugin, called ""Actions"", for various purposes. We found that 97% of repositories execute at least one Action that does not originate with a verified creator, and 18% of repositories in our dataset execute at least one Action with missing security updates. These represent potential attack vectors that can be used to compromise the execution of workflows, consequently leading to supply chain attacks. This work highlights the systemic risks inherent in CI/CD platforms like GitHub CI; we also present our own Github action, GWChecker, which functions as an early warning system for bad practices that violate the identified security properties. © USENIX Security Symposium, Security 2022.All rights reserved.",,Access control; Codes (symbols); Software design; Admittance control; Comprehensive analysis; Continuous integrations; Control codes; Execution control; Property; Security properties; Security risks; Software development and maintenances; Work-flows; Supply chains,,,USENIX Association,,9781939133311,,,English,"Proc.

We propose a quantile regression neural network model to capture the non-linear evolution of systemic risk in the European gas and oil markets. We find that the RUC significantly increased systemic risk in both the European gas and the oil markets. The systemic risk is higher, and rises much more quickly and falls much more slowly in the gas market than in the oil market. The dynamics of systemic risk are closely linked to major events during the RUC. The US-dollar-to-ruble exchange rate contributes most to this systemic risk, followed by Europe's gas stocks and gas imports from Russia. In terms of risk exposure, the gas market is more vulnerable than the oil market. We propose an elasticity coefficient of systemic risk to evaluate its sensitivity to stress scenarios.

Child maltreatment is an important topic for the medical sector as well. On the one hand, affected persons often seek support and help from healthcare professionals, but on the other hand, assaults can also occur in medical institutions by healthcare professionals. Surprisingly, there is hardly any data on the frequency of child maltreatment by healthcare professionals in general and particularly by nursing staff. Methods: Therefore, in a large representative survey of the German population of 2,516 subjects aged between 14 and 91, the experience of child maltreatment in medical institutions by nursing staff was assessed retrospectively. Results: Of the 46 subjects who had an inpatient stay in a child and adolescent psychiatry before the age of 18, 33.3% reported to have experienced maltreatment by nursing staff, while 17.3% of the 474 persons who had an inpatient stay in general or pediatric hospitals experienced maltreatment by nursing staff. All forms of maltreatment were significantly more frequent in psychiatric compared to general and pediatric hospitals. Conclusions: The results of our representative retrospective survey demonstrate that maltreatment by nursing staff are not rare individual cases, but that medical facilities bear systemic risks for assault. Therefore, it is necessary that all medical institutions, in particular psychiatric hospitals, address this issue. In order to reduce the risk for assaults, it is important not only to implement structural measures but also to develop an attitude that emphasizes zero tolerance for violence against children and adolescents. © 2020, The Author(s).",Child and adolescent psychiatry; Child maltreatment; Child protection; Medical institutions; Nursing,adolescent; adult; aged; article; assault; attitude; child; child abuse; child protection; child psychiatry; female; German (citizen); hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; mental hospital; nursing staff; pediatric hospital; prevalence; retrospective study; young adult,"Hoffmann, U.; Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychotherapy, Steinhövelstr. 5, Germany; email: ulrike.hoffmann@uniklinik-ulm.de",,BioMed Central Ltd,17532000,,,,English,Child Adolesc.

While macroprudential ideas have been widely embraced, the policy instruments used to implement them have typically revolved more narrowly around the monitoring of risk posed by discrete ‘systemically important’ entities. This operational focus on individual entities sidelines the more radical implications of macroprudential theory regarding fallacies of composition, fundamental uncertainty and the public control of finance. We explain this tension using a performative understanding of risk as a socio-technical construction, and illustrate its underlying dynamics through case studies of systemic risk governance at the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF or Fund). Drawing on official reports, consultation documents and archival sources, we argue that the FSB’s and IMF’s translations of systemic risk into a measurable and attributable object have undermined the transformative potential of the macroprudential agenda. The two cases illustrate how practices of quantification can make systemic risk seemingly more governable but ultimately more elusive. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The phrase ‘systemic risks’ denotes risk phenomena which are exceedingly complex and interdependent. Systemic risks originate in tightly coupled systems. They are characterised by cascading effects, tipping points and non-linear developments. Furthermore, compared to their potential impacts, they often lack proportional public awareness and adequate policies. Conventional risk management struggles with these challenges. Yet many threats to modern society, such as financial crises and the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, match these attributes. This article investigates the concept of systemic risks and raises questions for governance. The concept of inclusive risk governance serves as a guiding principle.

It relies on a multivariate CAPM-EGARCH model that accounts for sudden changes in volatility through the application of an iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS) algorithm on daily data over the sample period 2008–2014 to model time-varying volatility and ensure reliable estimates. The study confirms the lower systemic risk associated with Islamic indexes during the bearish period and reports that SRI, despite being more subject to systemic risk, offered higher alphas in highly integrated markets, while Islamic indexes performed better in less integrated ones. The evidence also reveals a very limited increase in the models’ predictability power from the integration of sudden changes in volatility into the EGARCH models during the full sample period. This limit is more marked during the bearish sub-period. Our findings have important implications for international investment and portfolio diversification perspectives in times of financial downturn. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Developed markets; Emerging markets; Financial turmoil; Islamic investment; Resilience; Socially responsible investment (SRI),,"Hassan, M.K.; Department of Economics and Finance, United States; email: mhassan@uno.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,09393625,,,,English,Econ.

The grave and devastating impacts of the current COVID-19 call for the need to assess the state of global and national preparedness for future pandemics. This chapter provides an outline of Sri Lanka's response to the COVID-19 pandemic while delving into the current status and gaps concerning preparedness for pandemics in the country. The analysis is aimed at providing key recommendations for policymakers to improve national-level preparedness for anticipated pandemic threats. This chapter has drawn on a review of secondary literature and primary data gathered through in-depth interviews conducted with key informants in the disaster management and public health sectors in the country. Findings show that while preparedness planning for biological hazards is predominantly a responsibility of the health sector in the country, there is a pressing need to strengthen such preparedness through a unified legal framework and system of governance that allow for the transfer of relevant expertise, infrastructure, and lessons learned from previous hazards contexts to situations of pandemics; the incorporation of pandemic preparedness into national-level DRR efforts and subnational-level DRR planning; intensifying national focus on building economic and social resilience; emulating a multisectoral approach, enhancing private sector participation, and establishing a national framework to foster preparedness for parallel hazards. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In the paper, this work analyses the systemic financial risk in China between 2011 and 2020 based on financial development, fragility and risk indicators and the world economy to construct a comprehensive index of systemic financial risk (CISFR). The results show an upward trend in China's financial risk in the past 10 years and a mid-To-high level fluctuation in the past five years, mainly driven by risks in the banking system, securities market and real estate market. In 2021-2022, China's financial system is still in a high-risk stage, and high systemic risks are still an important economic issue. The study's comprehensive index method can be extended to emerging economies. It reflects the main driving factors of financial risk by assigning weights to basic indicators from a multidimensional perspective, thus providing a reference for policymakers to prevent and control financial risk. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",applications; comprehensive index; Financial risk analysis; innovative financial development; quantitative measurement,,"Ullah, H.; Antai College of Economics and Management, China; email: hafeezullah@sjtu.edu.cn",,World Scientific,02175908,,,,English,Singap.

We propose a Tail Event driven Network Quantile Regression (TENQR) model which addresses these three aspects. More precisely, our framework captures the risk propagation and dynamics in terms of a panel quantile autoregression involving network effects that are quantified through a time-varying adjacency matrix. To reflect the risk content in stress situations the construction of the adjacency matrix is suggested to include tail events. More precisely we employ the conditional expected shortfall as risk profile. Based on the similarity of the risk profiles we create a positive and a negative network factor, which capture the effects of risk contagion and risk diversification respectively. The developed joint spacings variance ratio test supports the suggested methodology. The TENQR technique is evaluated using the SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The risk decomposition of the resulting network identifies the systemic importance of SIFIs and thus provides measures for the required level of additional loss absorbency. It is discovered that the positive network effect, as a function of the tail probability level, becomes more profound in stress situations and varies in its impact to SIFIs located in different geographic regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Network analysis; Network autoregression; Systemic risk; Tail event,Economics; Electric network analysis; Finance; Regression analysis; Statistics; Autoregression; Financial institution; Financial stability; Quantile regression; Risk diversification; Systemic risks; Tail events; Variance ratio test; Risk assessment,"Härdle, W.K.; Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany; email: haerdle@hu-berlin.de",,Elsevier Ltd,03044076,,JECMB,,English,J Econom,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055035733,scopus

The research shows that:1) Economic policy uncertainty has a positive effect on banking systemic risk. Compared with state-owned banking sector, economic policy uncertainty has more positive influence on non-state-owned banking sector. 2) Risk-taking, net interest margin and inter-bank business play a mediating role in the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and systemic risk of banks. Economic policy uncertainty can promote systemic risk of banks mainly by increasing bank risk-taking, narrowing net interest margin and expanding the scale of inter-bank business. The transmission channel of ""economic policy uncertainty-risk-taking,net interest margin,inter-bank business-banking systemic risk"" are effective. 3) Both bankers' optimism and capital regulation have a negative moderating effect on the relationship between economic policy uncertainty and banking systemic risk, and the improvement of bankers' optimism and capital regulation will weaken the promoting effect of economic policy uncertainty on banking systemic risk. © 2022 Systems Engineering Society of China.

The main cause is the level of complexity of financial interactions that poses a problem for regulators. We provide an analytical framework that decomposes complex ecosystems in both their overall level of instability and the contribution of institutions to instability. These ingredients are then used to study the pathways of the ecosystems towards stability by means of immunization schemes. The latter can be designed to penalize institutions proportionally to their contribution to instability, and therefore enhance fairness. We show that fair immunization schemes can also be cost-efficient when employed on ecosystems characterized by a tiered network structure of interactions concentrated among few core nodes that at the same time form many closed cycles that exacerbate instability. For less tiered network topologies we observe a trade-off between fairness and dollar-cost of immunization, allowing regulators to choose the combination that best meets their objectives.

By modifying the copula-extreme value theory-marginal expected shortfall (Copula-EVT-MES) method and using daily commodity returns from 2005M3–2020M5, our study captures significant intersectoral systemic risk spillovers, with asymmetrical and persistent patterns in energy-agricultural pairs. Furthermore, the bioethanol production (physical channel) and the financialization of commodities (financial channel) mainly relate to the shock spillovers. Compared to the financial crisis, the systemic risk spillovers in the COVID-19 crisis rely more on the physical channel, which emphasizes the importance of bioenergy-related shocks.

The first indicator, the Endogenous Risk Index (ERI)captures spillovers across portfolios arising from deleveraging in stress scenarios. The second indicator, the Indirect Contagion Index (ICI)measures the systemic importance of a bank by quantifying the loss its distressed liquidation would inflict on other institutions. Both are computable from portfolio holdings of financial institutions and measures of market depth for the assets held in the portfolio. We discuss the micro-foundation of these indicators and apply them to the analysis of the vulnerability of the European banking system to indirect contagion. Using data on portfolio holdings of European banks, we show that our indicators correlate to the magnitude of fire-sales losses in simulated stress scenarios, thus providing a simple to compute proxy for the outcome of stress tests. We also show that the information provided by our indicators on the systemic importance of banks is different from indicators based on size, thereby providing a measure of interconnectedness complementary to those currently used by supervisors. © 2019",Financial stability; Macro prudential regulation; Price-mediated contagion; Systemic risk measurement,,"Schaanning, E.; ETH Zurich, Rämistrasse 101, Switzerland; email: eric.schaanning@esrb.europa.eu",,Elsevier B.V.,03784266,,JBFID,,English,J.

It has become critically important recently for understanding systemic risk and risk contagion in the market. In this study, we propose complex networks enabled new methods to measure the causal comovement of individual stocks and the comovement structure of the market, which facilitate the examination of all kinds of hypotheses of comovement theories in a unified framework. Using a sample of the Chinese stock market from Jan. 1, 2006 to Dec. 31, 2016, we find that the degree of comovement generally intensifies over time, with a drastic increase from 2011 to 2015, while the comovement structure of the market changes with different market situations. Most importantly, our study reveals the driving force of causal comovement among individual stocks; that is, sentiment-based factors related to the market index indeed induce excess causal comovement in returns beyond that can be justified by fundamental factors including beta coefficient, book-to-market ratio, liquidity, profitability and volatility. Our study also reveals the determinants of comovement structure, which are attributable to the change of investors' behaviors in different periods. It turns out that investors in the Chinese stock market care about risk-return relationship in normal periods, while they seem to care only about risk in crisis periods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Common factors; Comovement measure; Comovement structure; Panel data model; Topology of causal network,,"Wu, J.; Department of Information Systems, China; email: wujj@buaa.edu.cn",,Elsevier B.V.,02649993,,,,English,Econ.

The Behavioral Engineering Model (BEM) developed by Gilbert provides us with a way to systematically and systemically identify barriers to individual and organizational performance. The BEM distinguishes between a person’s repertory of behavior (what the individual brings to the performance equation) and the environmental supports (the work environment factors that encourage or impede performance). By means of the Gilbert model this article will consider the risk criteria, determine the most significant risks of losses in the construction industry, and give suggestions on their minimization and elimination. In essence, the risk assessment is used to determine the measures that need to be taken to control the management or completely eliminate the risks that arise as a consequence of hazards. Qualitatively conducted engineering risk assessment and implementation of measures to prevent and minimize risks at the enterprise allows to reduce the probability of occurrence of dangerous events, thereby increasing security, and to reduce unprofitability.

In this study, we explore whether maintaining higher ESG ratings reduces the systemic risks of firms in a stock market context. For this purpose we analyse the systemic risk indicators of the constituent stocks of S&P Europe 350 for the period of January 2016–September 2020, which also partly covers the COVID-19 period. We apply a VAR-MGARCH model to extract the volatilities and correlations of the return shocks of these stocks. Then, we obtain the systemic risk indicators by applying a principle components approach to the estimated volatilities and correlations. Our focus is on the impact of ESG ratings on systemic risk indicators, while we consider network centralities, volatilities and financial performance ratios as control variables. We use fixed effects and OLS methods for our regressions. Our results indicate that (1) the volatility of a stock’s returns and its centrality measures in the stock network are the main sources contributing to the systemic risk measure, (2) firms with higher ESG ratings face up to 7.3% less systemic risk contribution and exposure compared to firms with lower ESG ratings and (3) COVID-19 augmented the partial effects of volatility, centrality measures and some financial performance ratios. When considering only the COVID-19 period, we find that social and governance factors have statistically significant impacts on systemic risk. © 2022 by the authors.

Shadow banks are interconnected and interdependent non-banking financial entities, which are highly leveraged, pro-cyclical and depend on volatile market-based wholesale funding. Their assets are risky and more illiquid than those of commercial banks. Shadow bank deposits lack a public backstop and are also denied central bank liquidity facility in times of severe distress.

To this end we divide the financial system into three sectors, namely: banks, insurance and brokerage industries, and real estate, applying the ΔCoVaR introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) as the measure for systemic risk. Our findings show that the systemic risk level of China's financial system reacted to the main systemic events covered by our sample period, reaching a major peak during the stock market crash of 2015. We further show, through the Wilcoxon signed rank test, that the systemic risk level of the financial system and sectors significantly increased after the main systemic events. In order to provide a formal systemic risk ranking of the financial sectors, we apply the bootstrap Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as developed by Abadie (2002), finding that the banking sector contributed the most, followed by real estate and subsequently insurance and brokerage industries. Finally, comparing banks systemic risk's determinants between China and the US, the reduced level of competition among banks in China is found to increase banks’ systemic risk, contrary to what is found in the US. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Dominance test; Financial stability; Systemic risk; ΔCoVaR,,"Morelli, D.; University of Kent, Parkwood Road, Canterbury, CT2 7FS, United Kingdom; email: D.A.Morelli@kent.ac.uk",,Elsevier B.V.,15723089,,,,English,J.

We construct dynamic total, net total and net pairwise return and volatility connectedness measures to better understand systemic risk and the transmission of shocks across REIT markets. Our findings show that that REIT market interdependence is dynamic and increases significantly during times of heightened uncertainty, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We also find that the US REIT market along with major European REITs are generally sources of shocks to Asian-Pacific REIT markets. Furthermore, US REITs appear to dominate European REITs.

The most commonly employed method for the safe disposal of these gases is burning them in flare stakes followed by releasing them in the environment. To date, various methods and procedures, preponderantly focusing on the modification of the units which generates the gases directed to flare stacks, have been introduced to reduce and/or recover these gases. These methods face with a number of issues, such as the lack of economic justification, high systemic risks, and operational limitations. In this research, four methods for flare gas recovery have been introduced, namely high-pressure steam generation, steam turbine, electricity and heat generation, and combined cycle, and they have been simulated using Aspen HYSYS software. According to the results, producing electric power from flaring gases in the last three methods was 7.323 e+5, 4.350 e+5, and 1.442e+006 kW, respectively, and it caused less pollution and saved energy. In order to assess the economic justification of the proposed methods, the economic assessment was conducted for each method, and economic return was calculated. The rate of investment return for the four processes of the high-pressure steam generation, steam turbine, electricity and heat cogeneration, and combined cycle was 18.66, 19.76, 25.79, and 31.97, respectively, reflecting the high economic return of the combined cycle method. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Combined cycle; Economic consideration; Electricity and heat; Flare gas recovery; High-pressure steam; Steam turbine,Associated gas; Flare stacks; Industrial waste disposal; Investments; Recovery; Steam; Steam generators; Steam turbines; Combined cycle; Economic considerations; Economic justification; Environmental issues; Flare gas recoveries; High-pressure steam; Petrochemical industry; Power generation systems; Electric power generation,"Pirouzfar, V.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Iran; email: v.pirouzfar@iauctb.ac.ir",,Springer Netherlands,13886150,,JTACF,,English,J Therm Anal Calor,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068007397,scopus

Interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted from one-to-one interviews with nine adolescents who received BA, generating an idiographic account of their experiences. Three superordinate themes emerged: how the format of BA can promote the integration of coping skills into one’s life; how interpersonal connections and therapeutic relationships may improve intervention outcomes; and how BA principles could be internalised as part of a young person’s day-to-day life. Participants valued the structure and flexibility of the manualised approach, forming an alliance with the therapist, and enhancing interpersonal relationships.

Six major themes emerge. First, from the outset, the Committee has argued against forbearance and taxpayer bailouts and instead advocated early regulatory intervention and prompt corrective action to force recognizing losses and recapitalizing troubled institutions. Second, when taxpayer bailouts take place there is a pressing need to protect taxpayer interests. Third, the Committee favored regulatory simplicity over complexity when it comes to structuring capital requirements and macroprudential policies. Fourth, the committee favored market price mechanisms when it comes to structuring capital constraints. Fifth, market mechanisms and prices should also be relied upon to monitor risk. Finally, the Committee urged the Fed to modernize how it implements monetary policy and cease its reliance upon the primary dealer system as the main conduit for such policy. © 2019, World Scientific Publishing Co.

In this paper, a theoretical framework is proposed to classify the time evolution of the basic defaults and contagious defaults using sequences of daily financial data. The new theoretical framework combines an existing asset value estimation algorithm and obligation clearing algorithm to calculate the time evolution of systemic risk. The asset value estimation algorithm is used to estimate the asset values of the banks each day and the obligation clearing algorithm is used to calculate systemic risk given the tuples of data each day. This framework is applied to assess the systemic risk of the Nigerian banking system between 2008 and 2014 when the economy was hit by the financial meltdown. The main findings depict that the risk of the basic defaults was high during this period while contagious default seldom appeared. It is also found that the Nigerian banking system was more stable in 2010 and 2012 than in other years, while it was seriously unstable in 2008, 2011, and 2014. The findings would assist in monitoring systemic risk in the Nigerian banking system. © 2021 The Author(s).

This trend is very positive, but there is still considerable room for improvement especially since frameworks to drive analysis of these causal factors are not widely available for routine accident analyses. Indeed, there is growing evidence that incident reporting remains insufficient for yielding feedback on many topics that are at the centre of process safety discussions today, such as systemic risk and emerging risks associated with new technologies. It can be argued that safety experts have limited tools for capturing warning signs of complex or new causal factors, such as ageing of sites, process automation, management of organizational change, and safety culture. Given increasing consensus on the value of safety performance monitoring, and the role of incident analysis in this process, it would seem that there should be greater attention to this limitation. To a large extent, complex and new causal factors belong to a third dimension of causality, beyond safety management systems and technical factors, that may require development of a third generation of user-friendly tools or frameworks to identify them. This paper describes the findings from a study that aimed to confirm the hypothesis that the practice of lessons learned analysis is not sufficiently capturing new and complex risk factors. To do so, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) conducted a study of lessons learned reported for 108 accidents occurring between 2010 - 2017. The study aimed to understand to what extent safety experts were actively seeking evidence of systemic and emerging risks in their analyses. This paper describes the findings from that study, presenting the state of practice with the eMARS database in regard to analysis of underlying causes and identification of precursors. The outcomes also suggest that many practitioners are already trying to apply a third level of analysis and in some cases point towards possible solutions.

The morphology of the carotid artery (CA) changes in response to atherosclerotic development by expansive remodeling (ER), the clinical significance of which remains unclear. This study aimed to define associations between ER and local risk factors, including CA geometry and traditional systemic risk factors for ischemic events, to determine whether ER could serve as a clinical marker of carotid vulnerable plaque. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed 66 patients with CA stenosis who were scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy or CA stenting. They calculated ER ratios in the internal CA (ICA) from long-axis MR images and as the maximal distance between the lumen and the outer borders of the plaque perpendicular to the axis of the ICA/the maximal luminal diameter of the distal ICA at a region unaffected by atherosclerosis. Relative overall signal intensity (roSI) was calculated to assess intraplaque hemorrhage and defined as the signal intensity of plaque on an axial T1-weighted image with maximal stenosis relative to that of the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle. The authors evaluated CA geometry by calculating the angles between the common CA (CCA) and ICA, and between the CCA and external CA (ECA) using digital subtraction angiography. The ER ratios, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, roSI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, low-density lipoprotein, statin medication, diabetes, smoking habit, and ischemic heart disease were compared between 33 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic patients. The authors also compared symptomatic status, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, ICA angle, ECA angle, roSI, and other traditional atherosclerotic risk factors between groups with extensive and slight ER. RESULTS The ER ratio was significantly greater in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (1.91 ± 0.46 vs 1.68 ± 0.40, p < 0.05). The ICA angle was significantly larger in the group with extensive ER than in those with slight ER (33.9° ± 20.2° vs 21.7° ± 13.8°, p < 0.01). The roSI, ECA angle, percentage stenosis, or any other traditional vascular risk factors were not associated with ER.

Equity Index (Nifty), Exchange Rate (USDINR), Bond (Govt 10Y Bond), Gold, Agricultural Index (N-Krishi) to ascertain the existence of significant sensitivity to standard shocks Engle and Campos-Martins (2020) either arising due to global political/economic factor or endogenous macroeconomic scenario. After that, the study undertakes the systemic spillover dynamics of Crude by estimating a self-exciting regime-switching Threshold Vector Auto-regression model based on cut-off values of Crude to test shock transmission from Crude amid major global events empirically. The findings indicate the existence of three regimes with threshold cut-offs for Crude return, viz. −2.358% and 2.294% for 2008 and 2020, respectively. After that Spillover Index is estimated across the three regimes. The findings indicate a sporadic increase in spillover during the Covid era, GFC and Oil Crisis. Despite Govt. Bond ranking high insensitivity, the spillover linkage is low. The results also indicate that, on average, systemic volatility shocks from crude oil are highest in Gold. In fact, Gold's sensitivity to crude price fluctuations escalates to new heights during the 2008–09 crisis, thus serving as a source of idiosyncratic shocks. Moreover, in recent duration, a unique see-saw kind of link has emerged between crude oil and Gold, where downward pressure by Crude on USDINR is eased by a fall in gold imports. Moreover, an analysis of the spillover pattern across the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) 2012 shows an intensification of spillover from Crude. The study is beneficial to policymakers to apply a systemic approach while empirically analyzing the spillover from a Global commodity such as Crude. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Crude oil; Geovolatility; GFEVD; Indian financial indices; Systemic risk spillover; Threshold VAR; Wholesale price index,Finance; Gold; Regression analysis; Financial index; Geovolatility; GFEVD; Indian financial index; Price index; Systemic risk spillover; Systemic risks; Threshold VAR; Whole sale prices; Wholesale price index; Crude oil; COVID-19; crude oil; macroeconomics; policy making; scenario analysis; spillover effect; India,"Kumar, P.; National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Vihar Lake, P.O.

An overly horizontal structure leads to overlaps and gaps in management functions. Inadequate hierarchical control by public agencies increases the likelihood of gridlocks in service delivery.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in working-Aged adults. There are 3 broad strategic imperatives to prevent blindness caused by DR. Primary prevention requires preventing or delaying the onset of DR in those with diabetes by systems-level lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical activity or dietary modifications, pharmacological interventions for glycaemic and blood pressure control, and systematic screening for the onset of DR. Secondary prevention requires preventing the progression of DR in patients with DR by continuing systemic risk factor control, regular screening to monitor for the progression of mild DR to vision-Threatening stages, and the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for managing DR. In this aspect, telemedicine-based DR screening incorporating artificial intelligence technology has the potential to facilitate more widespread and cost-effective screening, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. Tertiary prevention of DR blindness has been the main focus of the clinical ophthalmology community, classically based on laser photocoagulation treatment and ocular surgery but with an increasing use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) for vision-Threatening DR. Evidence from serial epidemiological studies shows blindness due to DR has declined in high-income countries (e.g., the USA and UK) due to coordinated public health education efforts, increased awareness, early detection by DR screening, sustained systemic risk factor control, and the availability of effective tertiary level treatment. However, the progress made in reducing DR blindness in high-income countries may be overwhelmed by the increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and DR in low-and middle-income countries (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, etc.). Thus, to tackle DR at a global level, a paradigm shift in strategic focus from tertiary towards secondary and primary prevention measures with a multi-pronged whole-of-society approach at regional and national levels is urgently needed. © 2019 S.

These institutions fall outside the realm of traditional banking and take an active part in the lending processes of economic turnover entities. The activities of these institutions, called the shadow banking system (SBS), led to an increase in systemic risks and had a negative impact on the state of the global financial system. This was distinctly displayed during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. The subject of this article is a series of measures taken by the international and national financial control bodies after the financial crisis to eliminate most risky aspects of shadow banking and to strengthen the system of financial oversight and monitoring. The final aim of the analysis is to evaluate effectiveness of the measures on strengthening control and limiting risks applied by the control bodies of the G-20 countries in the course of the reform to enterprises of the traditional and shadow sectors of the financial system. The results of the analysis show that the reform strengthened positions of traditional banks and improved their ability to resist financial shocks. As to the shadow banking sector, contrary to the statements of the initiators of the reform the regulative measures did not eliminate the systemic risks peculiar to nonbank financial institutions and did not stop their growing activities. This situation threatens the stability of the global financial system and a possibility of a new financial slump retains. © 2018 Finance: Theory and Practice.

Our methodology to assess Growth-at-Risk is composed of two building blocks. In the first step, we apply a machine learning methodology, namely the network-based NETS by Barigozzi and Brownlees, to identify significant linkages between pair of countries. In the second step, applying the CoVaR methodology by Adrian and Brunnermeier, and exploiting international statistics on trade flows and GDPs, we derive the entire distribution of Economic Growth spillover exposures at the bilateral, country and global level for different quantiles of tail events on economic growth. We find that Economic Growth Spillover probability distribution is time-varying, left-skewed and in some cases bi- or even multi-modal. Second, we prove that our two-step approach outperforms alternative one-step quantile regression models in predicting risks to economic growth. Finally, we show that Global exposure to economic growth tail events is decreasing over time. © 2020 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA",business cycle; CoVaR; LASSO; machine learning; NETS; networks; spillovers; systemic risk,business cycle; economic analysis; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; machine learning; regression analysis; risk assessment; spillover effect; trade flow,"Tizzanini, G.; Financial Markets and Intermediaries Analysis and Research, Italy; email: giacomo.tizzanini@prometeia.com",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,03915026,,,,English,Econ.

Suppose Z=(Z1,Z2) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A relevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of influence of high values of Z2 on Z1. This can be measured in a variety of ways. In this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E{(Z1−t)+|Z2&gt;t} called Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E(Z1|Z2&gt;t) called Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of risk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance, insurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under the assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and asymptotic tail independence for the risk vector Z. Many broad and useful model classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive the asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t→∞. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in the models, MME and MES converge to infinity under very general conditions; this reflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains significant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators we introduce an extrapolation method based on extreme-value theory to estimate both MME and MES for high thresholds t where little data are available. We show that these estimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and real data sets. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Asymptotic tail independence; Consistency; Expected shortfall; Heavy-tail; Hidden regular variation; Mean excess; Multivariate regular variation; Systemic risk,,"Das, B.; Singapore University of Technology and Design, 8 Somapah Road, Singapore; email: bikram@sutd.edu.sg",,Academic Press Inc.,0047259X,,JMVAA,,English,J.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a case study from Palu triple-disasters in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, the authors demonstrate how inland earthquakes in 2018 created cascading secondary hazards, namely tsunamis, liquefactions and landslides, caused unprecedented disasters for the communities and the nation. A qualitative analysis was conducted using the data collected through a long-term observation since 2002. Findings: The authors argue that Indonesia has yet to incorporate an SRG approach in its responses to the Palu triple-disasters. Political will is required to adopt more appropriate risk governance modes that promote the systemic risk paradigm. Change needs to occur incrementally through hybrid governance arrangements ranging from formal/informal methods to self- and horizontal and vertical modes of governance deemed more realistic and feasible. The authors recommend that this be done by focusing on productive transition and local transformation. Originality/value: There is growing awareness and recognition of the importance of systemic and cascading risks in disaster risk studies. However, there are still gaps between research, policy and practice. The current progress of disaster risk governance is not sufficient to achieve the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030) unless there is an effective governing system in place at the local level that allow actors and institutions to simultaneously manage the interplays of multi-hazards, multi-temporal, multi-dimensions of vulnerabilities and residual risks.

The findings show that the higher the level of digital awareness and the richer the digital products, the lower the systemic risk of banks; the higher the complexity of banks’ digital organization, the higher the systemic risk of banks. The digital development of banks reduces systemic risk overall by optimizing the structure of banks’ deposits and loans, and optimizing the structure of banks' deposits and loans at other levels. The degree of impact of digitalization on the systemic risk of banks differs by their attributes, and regional commercial banks are more affected than large state-owned banks and joint-stock banks.

In this paper, we introduce a class of PDEs that are invariant to permutations, and called symmetric PDEs. Such problems are widespread, ranging from cosmology to quantum mechanics, and option pricing/hedging in multi-asset market with exchangeable payoff. Our main application comes actually from the particles approximation of mean-field control problems. We design deep learning algorithms based on certain types of neural networks, named PointNet and DeepSet (and their associated derivative networks), for computing simultaneously an approximation of the solution and its gradient to symmetric PDEs. We illustrate the performance and accuracy of the PointNet/DeepSet networks compared to classical feedforward ones, and provide several numerical results of our algorithm for the examples of a mean-field systemic risk, mean-variance problem and a min/max linear quadratic McKean-Vlasov control problem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deep backward scheme; Exchangeability; Mean-field control; Permutation-invariant PDEs; Symmetric neural networks,Approximation algorithms; Deep learning; Economics; Nonlinear equations; Partial differential equations; Quantum theory; Control problems; Deep backward scheme; Exchangeability; Field-control; Mean-field; Mean-field control; Neural-networks; Permutation-invariant partial differential equation; Symmetric neural network; Symmetrics; Numerical methods,"Laurière, M.; ORFE, United States; email: lauriere@princeton.edu",,Springer,08857474,,JSCOE,,English,J Sci Comput,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128170242,scopus

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."" Marie Curie Americans are becoming increasingly aware of the systemic biases we possess and how those biases preclude us from collectively living out the true meaning of our national creed. But to fully understand systemic bias we must acknowledge that it is pervasive and extends beyond the contexts of race, privilege, and economic status. Understanding all forms of systemic bias helps us to better understand ourselves and our shortcomings. At first glance, a human bias against emerging technology caused by systemic risk misperception might seem uninteresting or unimportant. But this Article demonstrates how the presence of systemic bias anywhere, even in an area as unexpected as technology regulation, creates inefficiencies and inequalities that exact heavy costs in the form of human lives, standards of living, and lost economic opportunities. The decision to regulate or implement an emerging technology, like any other complex decision, naturally involves some form of cost-benefit or risk-reward analysis. However, in the context of emerging technology, that analysis is biased by systemic risk misperception. Immutable characteristics existing in emerging technology combine with interrelated characteristics in human decisionmakers and regulators to inflate perceptions of risks and depress perceptions of benefits. This artificial shifting of cost-benefit curves results in suboptimal legislative and regulatory responses to emerging technology, and ultimately, in the loss of American lives. © 2022 University of Illinois College of Law.

It argues that (1) both cases show a ‘confidence trap’ in that policy-makers of the government shared a complacent mindset that they can achieve the optimal mix of market liberalisation and repression, while believing that their political economic system is fundamentally different from others; (2) Such complacent confidence precipitated the supply-side driven financial reforms, in which both governments tried to diversify the credit channels of bank deposits by promoting non-bank financial intermediaries; (3) Exogenous shocks played a pivotal role in enforcing the government to take aggressive monetary easing and fiscal expansionary measures. But the Chinese case is different from the Japanese case in that (1) local politics has promoted a ‘too secure to fail’ situation in which rent-seeking activities are difficult to be detected, thus aggravating the hidden systemic risks; (2) China needs to liberalise its capital account with the more strengthened macroprudential regulatory governance, as the global foreign exchange markets have drastically changed from the period of the 1980s. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",asset and credit bubble; Bubble economy; financial crisis; financial liberalisation; macro-prudential regulation; shadow banking,banking; financial crisis; financial market; governance approach; inflation; liberalization; political economy; regulatory framework; savings; twentieth century; China; Japan,"Kang, M.-K.; Department of Political Science, United States; email: myung-koo.kang@baruch.cuny.edu",,Routledge,13563467,,,,English,New Polit.

Design Population-based cohort study. Setting The Liwan Eye Study, China. Participants 1405 baseline participants aged 50 years and older were invited to attend a 10-year follow-up examination. Primary and secondary outcome measures The International Society of Geographic and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology criteria was used to define glaucoma. Detailed information of mortality was confirmed using the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Presenting visual impairment (PVI) was defined as a presenting visual acuity of less than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye. The 10-year mortality rates were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the association between glaucoma and mortality. Results A total of 1372 (97.7%) participants with available gonioscopic data were included in the analysis. Of these, 136 (9.9%), 33 (2.4%) and 21 (1.5%) participants had primary angle closure (PAC) suspect (PACS), PAC and PAC glaucoma (PACG), and 29 (2.1%) had primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). After 10 years, 306 (22.3%) participants were deceased. The 10-year mortality was significantly associated with PACG (HR, 2.15, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.04, p=0.018) but not associated with PAC (HR, 1.27, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.39, p=0.463), PACS (HR, 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.83, p=0.099) and POAG (HR, 0.74, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.49, p=0.395) when age and gender were adjusted for. This association was no longer statistically significant (HR, 1.60, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.61, p=0.263) when covariables, such as income, education, body mass index, PVI, history of diabetes and hypertension, were adjusted for. Larger vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR >0.30) was only a significant risk factor in multivariable analysis (HR, 1.60, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.33, p=0.011). Conclusions PACG was significantly associated with higher long-term mortality, but this association was likely to be confounded by other systemic risk factors. VCDR >0.3 was the only independent predictor, implying that it may be a marker of ageing and frailty. ©",epidemiology; glaucoma; ophthalmology; public health,"adult; aged; Article; best corrected visual acuity; body mass; cataract extraction; China; closed angle glaucoma; cohort analysis; controlled study; cornea thickness; diabetes mellitus; disease association; eye examination; female; follow up; glaucoma; human; hypertension; ICD-9; long term survival; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; mortality rate; obesity; observational study; open angle glaucoma; proportional hazards model; risk factor; secondary glaucoma; slit lamp microscopy; underweight; vertical cup-to-disc ratio; visual impairment; age distribution; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; glaucoma; intraocular pressure; open angle glaucoma; prevalence; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; China; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Glaucoma; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Longitudinal Studies; Middle Aged; Prevalence","He, M.; State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Guangdong, China; email: mingguanghe@gmail.com",,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,34620651.0,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117160980,scopus

From a signal detection theory perspective, the superforecasting and Taleb et al. programs are complementary, not contradictory (a point Taleb and Tetlock (2013) recognized). The superforecasting program aims at achieving high hit rates at low cost in false-positives, whereas Taleb et al. prioritize alerting us to systemic risk, even if that entails a high false-positive rate. Proponents of each program should, however, acknowledge weaknesses in their cases. It is unclear: (a) how Taleb et al.

Nifty Index, MCX Gold, USDINR, Govt. Bond 10Y maturity and agricultural index N-Krishi. To facilitate cross-comparison decomposition of time-varying spillover output generated from Time-Varying Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) with aggregation at three layers is performed. The research finds that Indian Financial Indicators are vulnerable to spillover shocks from global variables predominantly driven by Fed Rate and Real Dollar Index. USDINR turns out to be most sensitive to global shocks and transgresses the shock to other financial indicators. Importantly, persistently high inflation has brought volatility spikes in the directional spillover to financial indicators. Though spillover subsidence is observed post-2014, with an all-time high during GFC, a sudden spurt in all financial indicators has been observed post-Covid-19, with Govt. bonds showing a sporadic rise. An important observation relates to staunch spillover from GDP during GFC with reoccurrence post-Covid. Additionally, a closely knit spillover tie is observed among USDINR, N-Krishi, and Crude. The study is beneficial to RBI to proactively monitor the weakening rupee along with Fed tapering to manage the rising spillover post-Covid-19. The effort of RBI has to be reciprocated by the government in inflation targeting to reinforce the curbing efforts of rising shock spillover. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Indian Econometric Society.",Connectedness; Fed rate; Indian financial indices; Inflation; Spillover; Systemic risk; TVP-VAR,,"Singh, V.K.; National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Vihar Lake, P.O.

In the research of risk contagion caused by the liquid asset, i.e. the counterparty default risk, all the liquid assets are seen as the same kind, therefore the heterogeneity of the liquid asset and its influence for the is ignored. The systemic risk assessing method for multi-layer financial network proposed in recently study could analysis heterogeneity of the settlement time of the liquid asset, however, hardly analysis the heterogeneity that some kinds of asset price may fall down with the market price (stock and bond) while the other (cash and loan) would not. In this paper, we propose a model to describe the risk contagion of the multi-layer financial network consist of different liquid asset types. Firstly, we construct a multi-layer financial network with M layer and N financial institutions, each layer represents a kind of asset and every financial institution will trade with other on each layer. Secondly, we describe two kinds of contagion in the contagion model, counterparty default risk and devaluation of the liquid asset. Finally, the difference between contagion result of the proposed heterogenous model and the homogenous model is compared through simulation. We find that the heterogeneity of the liquid asset will increase the contagion extent. The proposed model can analysis the effect of fluctuation in prices for heterogenous assets, and will further support the study of the contagion mechanism in the heterogenous financial network, and offer guidance for making a reasonable macroprudential regulation policy. © ESREL 2021.

The optimization reflects the desire of each bank to borrow from or lend to a central bank through manipulating its lending preference and the intention of each bank to deposit in the central bank in order to control the reserve and the corresponding volatility for cost minimization. The Markov Nash equilibrium for finite many players generated by minimizing the linear quadratic cost subject to Cox–Ingersoll–Ross type processes creates liquidity and deposit rate. The adding liquidity leads to a flocking effect implying stability or systemic risk depending on the level of the growth rate, but the deposit rate diminishes the growth of the total monetary reserve causing a large number of bank defaults. The central bank acts as a central deposit corporation.

Using daily stock market prices of six SA commercial banks1 from June 2007 to April 2016; Our results show a considerable increase in the market risk of all the six banks during the 2008 global financial crisis with African Bank being the riskiest bank in the country. Our systemic risk ranking shows that First Rand Bank was the largest contributor to systemic risk followed by Standard Bank, Barclays Africa, Nedbank, Capitec and lastly African Bank. These results suggest that the largest banks pose a bigger threat to the banking system than the smaller banks. These findings clearly indicate that different banks pose different threats to the banking system and the economy at large.

Our work fills a research gap by critically reviewing the feasibility of applying systemic causation models to assess environmental and public health risks associated with OUOGD and provides a catalyst for future research. Our primary objectives are to further the conceptual OUOGD process model and increase stakeholder awareness of useful systemic risk assessment tools for deliberating, communicating, and managing potential hazards. After examining popular linear and systemic risk assessment methods, benefits, and limitations, we critically assess the value of systemic techniques in OUOGD. A three-level process model (field development, pad-well, and well-phase) is synthesized from incomplete models found in the literature. The Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) is applied to elucidate a general risk control structure from diverse and multi-disciplinary references. Using this abstraction, we highlight the importance of leveraging systemic analysis approaches for environmental and public health risk management in OUOGD. The increasing significance of these methods given the adoption of new digital technology (e.g., drones, robotics, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, internet of things) to decision-making is evident. We recommend that researchers and practitioners (i.e., companies and regulators) thoughtfully embrace systemic risk analyses in their work to enhance the associated body of knowledge for understanding and preventing OUOGD accidents with potential impacts on public health and the environment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Control theory; Decision science; Hydraulic fracturing; Risk governance; Risk management; Systems theory,Accidents; Control theory; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision theory; Environmental technology; Health risks; Hydraulic fracturing; Public health; Public risks; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; System theory; Decision science; Environmental health risks; Gas development; Potential impacts; Public health risks; Risk analyze; Risk governance; Risks management; Systemic risks; Unconventional oil and gas; Risk management; governance approach; health risk; hydraulic fracturing; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; stakeholder; accident; adoption; artificial intelligence; awareness; big data; catalyst; decision making; digital technology; feasibility study; fracking; human; internet of things; physician; process model; public health; review; risk assessment; risk management; robotics; systems theory,"Khan, E.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Construction, Box 454015, United States; email: eakalak.khan@unlv.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697,,STEVA,,English,Sci.

This paper empirically evaluates the tail risk and systemic risk of technology firms. Our data sample consists of technology firms, and for comparison we also evaluate the tail risk and systemic risk of finance firms. We use daily equity returns data from 2 April 1992 to 31 December 2019 and we adopt the univariate extreme value theory (EVT) to determine equity tail risk. Our selection criteria is the market capitalisation and we choose the top twenty technology and the top twenty finance firms to evaluate tail risk and systemic risk. We found that the tail risk of technology firms is higher than the financial firms, whereas they are less likely to be in distress conditional upon a shock from the system. However, this finding for technology firms reverses when we use recent data via our six-year rolling estimates.

Data from January 1995 to July 2017 in nine regions in England and in the overall England housing market are adopted. Through simultaneous estimates of volatility in various regions, the systemic risk and overall risk of each region are evaluated. The results reveal that housing markets in the central regions diffuse risks easily, and their volatility is easily affected by stock market return and money supply changes. By contrast, the volatility of housing markets in the southern regions is easily affected by changes in the interest rate, and these markets demonstrate high transmission with the overall housing market in the short term. Notably, except for times when financial crises occurred, housing market risks in the southern regions have been lower than those of other regions. In particular, London exhibits significantly low risk and high return in its housing market and high informativeness in its house prices.

Equivalence allows third-country financialfirms to operate in the internal market on the basis of their home country regulation if this is equivalent to EU law. There are three different procedural safeguards to avoidfinancial stability risks: a) ex ante assessment of third countries’ regulation to ensure regulatory compatibility between the EU and the third country; b) ex postwithdrawal of market access if cross-border liberalization triggers a “race to the bottom”; and c) direct supervision of systemic third-country entities to prevent them from becoming vectors of cross-border systemic risk. The article argues that those safeguards are ineffective in protecting the internal market from external risks. It proposes two alternative reforms. First, the EU could replace equivalence with a system of substituted compliance, following the US model where foreign financial firms must register with local authorities and follow host country regulation. Alternatively, the EU could reinforce the assessment, withdrawal, and supervisory procedure by harmonizing the current patchwork of different equivalence rules. © 2021.

Study of incidence, risk factors and efficacy of prevention and treatment of vitreous cavity hemorrhage after 23-gauge vitrectomy in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Materials and methods. Records of 436 eyes (380 patients, 173 males and 207 females, mean age 57.06±9.05 years), which underwent 23-gauge vitrectomy for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were retrospectively analysed. Mean follow-up duration was 24.66±19.90 months. Results. Early recurrent hemorrhage (RH) into vitreal cavity (VC) was observed in 63 eyes (14.4% of all operated eyes), late RH, which was observed 1 month and later after surgery – in 56 eyes (12.8%). Both early and late RH was observed in 12 eyes (2.8%). Risk factors for early RH were: recent intraocular hemorrhage before surgery, incomplete panretinal laser photocoagulation, partial peripheral adhesion of posterior hyaloid. Preoperative bevacizumab injection reduced risk of early RH 3 times (p=0.039). Preoperative iris neovascularisation increased risk of late RH in 8.6 times (p<0.001). Systemic risk factors for late RH were: history of lower extremity amputations, and complicated cardiovascular history. VC lavage was performed in 17 eyes (27.0%) with early RH. Treatment options in eyes with late RH were intravitreal bevacizumab injection (25 eyes, 44.6%), VC lavage (6 eyes, 10.7%), permanent silicone oil infusion (4 eyes, 7.1%). Conclusion. Different risk factors were identified for early and late RH into VC after vitrectomy for PDR. Preoperative bevacizumab injection reduces risk of early RH, but in cases of late RHs may be effectively used to prevent recurrences. © Design and decor of ""Professional Editions"" Unitary Enterprise, 2018.",23-gauge vitrectomy; Bevacizumab; Proliferative diabetic retinopathy; Recurrent hemorrhage,,"Kerimov, M.; Zarifa Aliyeva National Ophthalmology CentreAzerbaijan; email: mushfikk@mail.ru",,Professionalnye Izdaniya,22260803,,,,Russian,Oftalmol.

In order to avoid the outbreak of financial crisis, economists and policy makers around the world pay special attention to the timely warning of financial crisis. If we can make an accurate early warning of the economic crisis, the government and regulatory agencies will have more time to deal with the possible risks and avoid major interference to economic growth. Based on this, this paper studies the spatial aggregation analysis and systemic risk prevention of Internet Finance Based on neural network model. Based on BP neural network, this paper constructs a spatial econometric model by using spatial econometric analysis method, and analyzes the empirical results of financial spatial aggregation. The results show that the Moran's I value of China's Internet finance index in December 2019 is 0.372, P value is 0.001, Moran's I value of Internet payment is 0.395, P value is 0.002, Moran's I value of Internet monetary fund is 0.357, P value is 0.001, Moran's I value of Internet investment and financing is 0.324, P value is 0.002, Moran's I of Internet insurance is 0.313, P value is 0.001.

This paper aims at building and validating a new class of early warning signals of critical transitions. We base our analysis on information spreading patterns in dynamic temporal networks, where nodes are connected by short-term causality. Before a tipping point occurs, we observe flickering in information spreading, as measured by clustering coefficients. Nodes rapidly switch between ""being in"" and ""being out"" the information diffusion process. Concurrently, stock markets start to desynchronize. To capture these features, we build two early warning indicators based on the number of regime switches, and on the time between two switches. We divide our data into two sub-samples. Over the first one, using receiver operating curve, we show that we are able to detect a tipping point about one year before it occurs. For instance, our empirical model perfectly predicts the Global Financial Crisis. Over the second sub-sample, used as a robustness check, our two statistical metrics also capture, to a large extent, the 2016 financial turmoil. Our results suggest that our indicators have informational content about a future tipping point, and have therefore strong policy implications. © 2019, The Author(s).",,article; case report; clinical article; diffusion; market,"Gatfaoui, H.; IÉSEG School of Management (LEM - CNRS 9221), 1 Parvis de La Défense, La Défense Cedex, France; email: h.gatfaoui@ieseg.fr",,Nature Publishing Group,20452322,,,30952925.0,English,Sci.

We argue that MREL has a double nature. On the one hand, it should ensure the feasibility of resolution in case of a bank failure. On the other hand, it aims at restricting the funding model of banks, similarly to the other (preventive) capital requirements. By analysing the 2019 reform of the EU banking regulation, we contend that MREL represents an important complement to the rest of the preventive regulatory framework and that the latest reform unleashes such potential. We demonstrate that the new rules on MREL determination and enforcement allow the resolution authority to look after the build-up of systemic risk. The analysis reveals that MREL can serve both micro- and macro-prudential purposes. Finally, we argue that the current institutional architecture represents the main impeding factor for the new regulation to efficiently work, curbing the positive preventive potential of MREL. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Bank Resolution; BRRD II; Macro-Prudential Regulation; MREL; Preventive Regulation,,"Martino, E.D.; Amsterdam Center for Law & Economics, Netherlands; email: e.d.martino@uva.nl",,De Gruyter Open Ltd,16132548,,,,English,Eur.

We develop a novel measure of bank interconnectedness using syndicated corporate loan portfolios, overlap based on industry and region, and different weights such as equal weights, size and relationships. We find that interconnectedness is driven mainly by bank diversification, less by bank size or overall loan market size. Interconnectedness is positively correlated with different bank-level systemic risk measures including SRISK, DIP and CoVaR, and such a positive correlation mainly arises from an elevated effect of interconnectedness on systemic risk during recessions. Overall, our results highlight that institution-level risk reduction through diversification ignores the negative externalities of an interconnected financial system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Interconnectedness; Networks; Syndicated loans; Systemic risk,,"Steffen, S.; Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Adickesallee 32-34, Germany; email: s.steffen@fs.de",,Elsevier B.V.,15723089,,,,English,J.

To untangle this we propose a GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) common features approach, where systemic risk emerges from a common factor source (or indeed multiple factor sources) with contagion evident through possible changes in the factor loadings relating to the common factor(s). Within a portfolio mimicking factor framework this can be identified using moment conditions. We use this framework to identify contagion in three illustrations involving both single and multiple factor specifications: to the Asian currency markets in 1997–1998, to US sectoral equity indices in 2007–2009 and to the CDS (credit default swap) market during the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010–2013. The results reveal the extent to which contagion effects may be masked by not accounting for the sources of changed volatility apparent in simple measures such as correlation.

From an aggregate perspective, China’s systemic financial risk tended to ease overall in 2021, but remained high. The risk profile of China’s financial system in 2021 presented five important features. First, the macro leverage ratio fell slightly, but exposed the hidden dangers of balance sheet recession. Second, there was a certain blockage in the transmission of financial system liquidity to the real economy. Third, the fragility of the financial system was further exposed, the bond default balance reached a new high, the structural differentiation of bonds between state-owned and private enterprises became prominent, and private enterprise default became more serious. Fourth, the contagion effect of domestic cross-market financial risks remained significant. Fifth, the international political and economic situation was volatile, and spillover effects such as the rising prices of raw materials, the inauguration of a new US administration, and the shift of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy were significantly strengthened. In terms of key risk areas, the risks of the real estate market, hidden government debt, and small- and medium-sized domestic banks were quite prominent. in 2022, pandemic prevention and control, economic recovery, and structural upgrading will remain the main themes of China’s development. China’s financial risks are generally under control, but the country will still face major risks such as a high macro leverage ratio, tight market liquidity, increasing debt vulnerability, significant spillover effects, and rising volatility in the international market. © 2022 Social Sciences in China Press.",macro leverage ratio; spillover effects; structure; systemic risk,,,,Routledge,02529203,,,,English,Soc.

For this objective, we calculate the stock market's synchronization using the Minimum Spanning Tree Length (MSTL) network analysis method. Then, we implement forecasting tests in and out the sample to assess the forecasting power on the stock market's synchronization to predict the individual stock realized volatility. Additionally, we test a VAR and a forecast error variance decomposition analysis to study Granger causality's presence on volatility. Our results show that synchronization within a market exists and changes over time. Our main results show that an increase in synchronization causes an increase in financial assets' realized volatility in the following month. Our results made it possible to study financial markets' synchronization and take a systemic risk approach to improve investment management. Our main idea was that the stock markets' synchronization positively correlates with financial assets' volatility. The greater the synchronization, the greater the volatility in the following period.

As China enters a “new normal” stage of economic growth, the real investment rate drops, non-financial enterprises continuously allocate resources to the shadow banking system. The financial economy becomes increasingly divorced from reality. This leads us to the questions: will the shadow banking behavior of non-financial companies exacerbate the risk of stock price crash risk? How does the increase in economic policy uncertainty affect the relationship between non-financial companies' shadow banking activities and stock price crash risk? This article uses non-financial listed companies' data from 2007 to 2017 and conducts empirical analysis to answer this question. The study finds that companies engaged in high-leverage, high-risk shadow banking business exacerbate stock crash risk. This effect is only pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises and low social trust regions. The increase in the degree of economic policy uncertainty positively impacts the relationship between non-financial companies' shadow banking business and stock price crash risk. The theoretical mechanism is as follows: the rise in economic policy uncertainty amplifies the positive relationship between shadow banking activities of non-financial companies and stock price crashes by increasing bank loans, investors' sensitivity to external information, risk cross-contagion, and inefficient investment mechanisms. Various robustness tests do not change the research conclusion.

We apply a weighted and directed network model to analyse the implications for default contagion and systemic risk under different stress testing scenarios. The empirical results indicate that the topology of the loan guarantee network is close to a ‘scale-free’ structure, which is known to be robust against accidental failures but vulnerable to coordinated attacks. Hence, the network is able to cope with idiosyncratic shocks resulting from single company failures, but can easily suffer from more widespread contagion if a group of systemically important companies are hit by a targeted shock. We further demonstrate that within our sample of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) companies, increasing leverage reduces network stability and exacerbates the effects of contagion.

Given the scope of the phenomenon, recent evidence indicates how growing regional divergences are increasingly jeopardizing social cohesion, fueling inequalities even within regions. The dichotomy between less developed and core regions seems to lose the centrality in the political agenda. An example is provided by the new geography of knowledge that is giving rise to a complex divergence that rests also on the different internal regional contexts’ conditions. Regions are exposed to multidimensional shocks and stresses questioning territories’ resilience and their ability to manage the transition process. The paper argues that regions need to enhance their resilience to transition-induced shock (dynamics) understanding this internal complex divergence. The paper introduces the multiscale approach as a dynamic factor in the policy-making process to capture the sensitiveness of places to adaptation, resilience-oriented performance, and the disruption of path dependency - which may be considered as the main obstacle for an equitable distribution of competitive advantage derived from innovation - and lead the post-carbon transition required by the European Green Deal. The analysis conducted rests on the conceptual framework of the Open Access Toolkit conceived for the TREnD Research Project funded by the Horizon 2020 Program. The conceptual framework adopted, underpinned by sets of indicators that couple context conditions with innovation performance, can be used to explore and identify in further studies EU settings that are more exposed to systemic risks associated with the transition process. © The Author(s) 2020.",Context conditions; Multiscale approach; Peripheral areas; Resilience; Transition,Competition; Competitive advantage; Conceptual frameworks; Innovation performance; Multi-dimensional shock; Multi-scale approaches; Political agenda; Regional disparities; Transition process; Dynamics,"Bevilacqua, C.; CLUDSLab, Italy; email: cbevilac@unirc.it",Bevilacqua C.Calabro F.Della Spina L.,Springer,21903018,9783030528683,,,English,Smart Innov.

Using data on 327 listed companies over the period 2007–2016, we extend the default clustering estimation to nonfinancial sector and document clear time-varying and cross-sectional variations of the default clustering in different nonfinancial industries in China. We find that stock market volatility, fixed asset investments and Credit-to-GDP gap are the key determinants of the time series default cluster variations. We further examine how these nonfinancial sector default clusters are related to the systemic risk measured by the default clustering and CoVaR in banking. We show that Manufacturing, Wholesale Retail, and Real Estate industries demonstrate high correlations with systemic risk, suggesting the importance of monitoring these industries as part of the macroprudential policy.

We verify that countries that were epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced critical levels of risk, which is partially explained by more stringent confinement measures since these are the ones whose labor markets will suffer more in the medium and long run.

In addition, research on the prediction of systemic financial risk plays a significant role in the sustainable development of the financial market. Therefore, this paper takes China's financial market as its research object, considers the risks co-activity among major financial sub-markets, and constructs a financial composite indicator of systemic stress (CISS) for China, describing its financial systemic stress based on 12 basic indicators selected from the money market, bond market, stock market, and foreign exchange market. Furthermore, drawing on the decomposition and integration technology in the TEI@I complex system research methodology, this paper introduces advanced variational mode decomposition (VMD) technology and extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms, constructing the VMD-DE-ELM hybrid model to predict the systemic risk of China's financial market. According to eRMSE, eMAE, and eMAPE, the prediction model's multistep-ahead forecasting effect is evaluated. The empirical results show that the China's financial CISS constructed in this paper can effectively identify all kinds of risk events in the sample range. The results of a robustness test show that the overall trend of China's financial CISS and its ability to identify risk events are not affected by parameter selection and have good robustness. In addition, compared with the benchmark model, the VMD-DE-ELM hybrid model constructed in this paper shows superior predictive ability for systemic financial risk. © 2022 - IOS Press.

There is no common understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of disease. This is largely due to the absence of direct optic nerve head blood flow registration method in ophthalmology. AIM: The aim of this work is to evaluate ocular hemodynamics using different methods in patients with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 73 patients were enrolled in the study. 46 patients (46 eyes) with NAION were included in the first group. Control group was composed of 27 patients (50 eyes) with systemic risk factors of NAION without any retinal and optic nerve diseases. Regional hemodynamics parameters were evaluated with ophthalmosphigmography, ophthalmoplethys-mography, ophthalmoreography, OCT-angiography and EDI-OCT. RESULTS: Blood flow values in different parts of the choroid did not statistically differ between groups when using ophthal-mosphigmography, ophthalmoplethysmography, ophthalmoreography methods. Radial peripapillary capillaries in optic nerve head area were evaluated, and statistically significant difference was found in all sectors. CONCLUSION: The main component of NAION pathogenesis is a decreasing perfusion pressure in paraoptic short posterior ciliary arteries. Blood flow in choroid does not play an important role in the disease pathogenesis. © Authors, 2022.",non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; OCT-angiography; ocular hemodynamics; optical coherence tomography; short posterior ciliary arteries,,"Antonov, V.A.6–8, L’va Tolstogo st., Russian Federation; email: antonov@alborada.fi",,Eco-Vector LLC,19987102,,,,Russian,Ophthalmol.

The ability of econometric models to predict extreme events strongly relies on their flexibility to account for the highly nonlinear and asymmetric dependence patterns observed in financial time series. In this paper, we develop a new class of flexible copula models where the dependence parameters evolve according to a Markov switching generalized autoregressive score (GAS) dynamics. Maximum likelihood estimation is performed using a two-step procedure where the second step relies on the expectation–maximization algorithm. The proposed switching GAS copula models are then used to estimate the conditional value at risk and the conditional expected shortfall, measuring the impact on an institution of extreme events affecting another institution or the market.

Lung injury in current and former workers in popcorn manufacturing suggests a possible association with diacetyl inhalation exposure. Although the number of e-Cig users continues to rise steadily among the teens and adults, the potential risk of pulmonary disease has not been characterized. A systematic review of the open literature identified bronchiolitis obliterans—a pathological inflammation resulting in fibrosis of the bronchioles leading to an irreversible limitation to airflow in lungs—as the primary outcome of diacetyl exposures. Following the deterministic United States National Research Council/Environmental Protection Agency's risk assessment framework, that consists of four key steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterization, we estimated noncarcinogenic (systemic) risks using a Hazard Quotient (HQ) approach upon exposure to diacetyl among teens and adults who use e-Cigs. Based on the NIOSH Benchmark Dose (BMD; 0.0175 mg/kg-day) and modelled Average Daily Doses (ADDs; range 0.11–5.2 mg/kg-day), we estimated 12 different HQ values—a measure of non-carcinogenic risk for diacetyl inhalation exposures—all of which were greater than 1 (range 6.2875–297.1429), suggesting a significantly higher non-carcinogenic risk from diacetyl exposures among the teens and adults who use e-Cigs. These results underscore the need to regulate e-Cigs to protect teens and adults from diacetyl exposures and risk of developing lung injuries, including bronchiolitis obliterans. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Average daily dose; Bronchiolitis obliterans; Diacetyl; E-juice; Electronic cigarettes; Hazard Quotient,"Biological organs; Electronic assessment; Hazards; Risk perception; Tobacco; Dose-response assessments; Exposure assessment; Hazard identification; Inhalation exposure; National Research Council; Risk assessment framework; Risk characterization; Systematic Review; Risk assessment; 2,3 butanedione; 2,3 butanedione; flavoring agent; adult; chemical compound; electronic equipment; hazard assessment; health risk; respiratory disease; risk assessment; smoking; young population; adolescent; adolescent smoking; adult; airway obstruction; Article; bronchiole; bronchiolitis obliterans; cancer risk; chemical parameters; disease risk assessment; environmental exposure; environmental protection; health hazard; human; inhalation; lung fibrosis; lung injury; risk management; smoking ban; systematic review; United States; electronic cigarette; occupational exposure; risk assessment; vaping; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Diacetyl; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Flavoring Agents; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Risk Assessment; United States; Vaping","Pokhrel, L.R.; Department of Public Health, United States; email: POKHRELL18@ecu.edu",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697,,STEVA,33770882.0,English,Sci.

Temporal business environment fluctuations cause disruptions that require quantitative risk analysis tools to understand and mitigate supply chain risks. This paper presents the formulation and application of the dynamic flow Bayesian networks (DFBNs) and the optimised dynamic flow Bayesian networks (ODFBNs) for a three-stage supply chain. DFBNs are created by integrating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) and system dynamics (SD) to demonstrate the feedback flows of a supply chain with systemic risks considered. ODFBNs that incorporate mathematical optimisation with the original DFBNs are also developed to generate an optimisation-enhanced risk-influenced dynamic flow analysis. DFBN and ODFBN provide supply chain practitioners with a more effective reference for their business strategy. Comparison between the ODFBN and the DFBN is illustrated with a discussion of preliminary modelling results.

Materials and Methods: This was a prospective interventional study concerning patients who underwent optical and therapeutic PK in Hamidia hospital Bhopal during a period of Dec 2016 to May 2108. Age, gender, eye, indication of PKP, and best- corrected visual acuity (BCVA) constituting the preoperative data were recorded in a predesigned proforma. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed using similar technique and patients were followed up till a period of 1 year and post operative complications were identified and managed accordingly. The outcome was assessed in terms of percentage improvement in logMAR visual acuity and the variables affecting the final visual outcome were studied. Results: Of the total 50 cases of penetrating keratoplasty that were analyzed 33 were done for therapeutic purposes and 17 were done for optical reasons. Mean recipient age was 39.88 years ±2.9 years, range 3-68. Follow up period was 1 year. The indications were therapeutic (34%), post traumatic or post infective corneal scarring (50%), previous graft failure (6%) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (4%). In optical PK, 62.5% recipient eyes showed good visual improvement (improvement of more than -0.8 log MAR). 21.8% eyes showed moderate visual improvement, and 15.6% eyes showed no visual improvement. In eyes with therapeutic PK, 46.7% showed good visual improvement, 13.3% moderate and 40% showed no visual improvement. Conclusion: Penetrating keratoplasty done for both optical and therapeutic indications resulted in fairly good visual outcome. The pre-operative host risk factors were associated with an increased probability of graft rejection. Careful workup of recipients for corneal transplantation with reference to local and systemic risk factors is of utmost importance in the outcome of corneal transplantation with regards to graft survival. © 2019, IP Innovative Publication Pvt.

Rather than identifying risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter–related thrombosis, exploring the effect of these risk factors might be a promising method to improve the outcomes of thrombosis. Objectives: To analyze the effect of systemic and local risk factors on triggering peripherally inserted central catheter–related thrombosis in the first two weeks post–insertion in cancer patients. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: The study was conducted at a 4500-bed university-affiliated medical center in China. Participants: One hundred seventy-three cancer patients with peripherally inserted central catheters were included. Methods: Peripherally inserted central catheter–related thrombosis was assessed using ultrasound at a series of timepoints, once every two days post–insertion. Data on age, body mass index, blood hypercoagulation, insertion attempts, catheter-to-vein ratio, and blood flow velocity were collected as risk factors. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling were used to describe the study samples and analyze the effects of systemic and local risk factors. Results: Among the 173 cancer patients included, 126 (72.8%) patients were diagnosed with peripherally inserted central catheter–related thrombosis. Most thromboses (n = 118, 93.7%) were detected within five days, and 100% were detected within nine days post–insertion. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that local risk factors [catheter-to-vein ratio (standardized path coefficient = 0.32, p < 0.05) and blood flow velocity (standardized path coefficient = −0.35, p < 0.05)] had a greater effect than systemic factors [age (standardized path coefficient = 0.13, p < 0.05) and blood hypercoagulation (standardized path coefficient = 0.17, p < 0.05)] on triggering peripherally inserted central catheter–related thrombosis. Conclusion: Peripherally inserted central catheter–related thrombosis is quite common and can occur very early post–insertion in cancer patients. Among the common risk factors, local risk factors reflecting peripherally inserted central catheter technology itself had a greater effect than systemic risk factors reflecting predisposition to thrombosis.

Methods: A total of 1,063 eyes of 1,063 diabetic patients were enrolled. We conducted binary and multiple multivariate regressions to analyze the ocular and systemic risk factors of DR. Based on the presence of myopia and history of cataract surgery, we divided the cases into four subgroups, namely those with high myopia, with the history of cataract surgery, with both conditions, and with neither, then determined the correlation between the stages of DR and CKD in each subgroup. Results: In the binary analysis, high myopia was identified as the protective factor for DR odds ratio (OR): 0.312 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.195–0.500, p < 0.001], whereas cataract surgery was one of the independent risk factors for DR [OR: 2.818 (95% CI: 1.507–5.273), p = 0.001]. With increased stages of DR, high myopia played an increasingly protective role [mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), OR = 0.461, p = 0.004; moderate NPDR OR = 0.217, p = 0.003; severe NPDR, OR = 0.221, p = 0.008; proliferative DR (PDR), OR = 0.125, p = 0.001], whereas cataract surgery became a stronger risk factor, especially in PDR (mild NPDR, OR = 1.595, p = 0.259; moderate NPDR, OR = 3.955, p = 0.005; severe NPDR, OR = 6.836, p < 0.001; PDR, OR = 9.756, p < 0.001). The correlation between the stages of DR and CKD in the group with neither high myopia nor cataract surgery history was the highest among all subgroups. Conclusion: High myopia was a protective factor, whereas cataract surgery is a risk factor for DR, and both factors showed stronger effects throughout the (natural disease) grading of DR. The stages of DR and CKD showed a higher correlation after adjustment of the ocular confounding factors.

The macroprudential policy aims to limit systemic risks occurring in financial distress conditions that lead to broader economic losses. One of the macro-prudential policy instruments applied by the financial services authorities in various countries, including Indonesia, is the Loan-to-Value ratio limitation. This countercyclical policy is intended to control the rate of growth in property credit. This paper discusses the effects of limiting the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio by Bank Indonesia on the growth of bank property credit in Indonesia. Using ordinary least squares, the results of this study conclude that adopting a tightening LTV policy when economic growth high has a significant influence in holding back the pace of five months of property credit growth after the policy was issued. While the LTV policy's implementation, which is loosening when economic growth is slowing down, has no significant effect in driving the pace of property credit growth. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Environmental protection; Finance; Losses; Planning; System stability; Economic growths; Financial distress; Financial institution; Financial service; Financial system; Global financial crisis; Ordinary least squares; Policy instruments; Sustainable development,"Taufik, A.; Bank IndonesiaIndonesia; email: agus_t@bi.go.id",Herdiansyah H.,IOP Publishing Ltd,17551307,,,,English,IOP Conf.

This study is among the first few to use three different distance-to-risk measures to empirically assess the domestic interbank linkages and systemic contagion risk of the Chinese banking industry, by using bivariate dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model on data collected from eight prominent Chinese banks for the period 2006–2018. The results show a relatively high correlation among almost all the banks, suggesting an interconnectedness among the banks. We found evidence that the banking system is exposed to significant domestic contagion risks arising from systemic defaults. Given that Chinese markets deliver weak signals of forthcoming stress in banking sectors, new policy intervention is crucial to resolve the hidden stress in the system. The results have important policy implications and will provide scholars and policymakers further insight into the risk contagion originating from interbank networks. © 2021 by the authors.

Any changes occurring in this network may generate shocks that either are not very visible at the macroeconomic level, but can greatly affect this level, or microeconomic shocks may occur with the spread across the entire economic chain. In recent years, bank accidents have led to a significant disruption to the financial system around the world. Including the 2008 economic crisis has demonstrated that we need to better understand financing networks and systemic risk. The complexity of current financial systems around the world makes it difficult to create indicators that accurately assess the systemic risk of any institution. One of the most important issues that have been highlighted in recent years has been the interconnection of banks in the financial network. This leads to an increase in the likelihood of contagion, a scenario where small shocks, which initially only affected a party of institutions in the system, spread across the network. In a globalizing context, financial contagion is a phenomenon of topicality characterized by the virulence and rapidity with which financial crises are transmitted from one economy to another in a more interconnected world.This article aims to analyze the phenomenon of financial contagion and systemic risk in banking networks from the theoretical perspective and the level of practical research, in order to highlight the vulnerability of financial systems and the need for adequate predencial regulation.

Issues are especially pronounced for meeting goals of environmental sustainability due to the complex dynamics of socio-ecological systems. In practice, a CCRA can therefore differ from its original conceptual blueprint. These challenges are explored from a knowledge systems perspective, focusing on the role of stakeholders/policymakers, risk descriptors, methods, evidence sources, and scientists. A UK case study evaluates recent developments (CCRA3) including identification of policy urgency through adaptation shortfalls and its application to the natural environment. Important science-policy issues are also highlighted regarding inclusion of opportunities, systemic risks, residual risks, and risk tolerance. A general conclusion is that CCRAs inevitably leave open questions which lead back to their evolving role in the science-policy interface. A knowledge systems perspective identifies CCRAs as open, adaptive, reflexive processes that help redefine interpretations of risk and adaptation, rather than just providing a specific policy-relevant product. This perspective identifies scope for progressive refinement of CCRAs to enhance collective science-policy adaptive capacity whilst also engaging wider society. For environmental sustainability, this open process can be used to iteratively redefine robust future pathways and system reference conditions that also better reflect evolving societal perceptions and tolerance on sustainability risk in the face of climate change. © 2022, The Author(s).",Climate change; Environmental sustainability; Knowledge systems; National Adaptation Plans; National Climate Change Risk Assessments,Climate change; Iterative methods; Public policy; Risk perception; Sustainable development; Adaptation policies; Climate change risks; Complex dynamics; Environmental sustainability; Knowledge system; National adaptation plan; National climate change risk assessment; Risks assessments; Science policies; Socio-ecological systems; Risk assessment; adaptive management; climate change; environmental planning; knowledge; national planning; policy making; prioritization; risk assessment; sustainability,"Brown, I.; Dept. of Geography and Environmental Science, United Kingdom; email: ixbrown@dundee.ac.uk",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,01650009,,CLCHD,,English,Clim.

These measures allow us to estimate the expected capital shortfall in the case of a crisis. The empirical analysis is performed on a sub-sample of the banks included in the stress test exercise, because only 57 European banks, in 22 countries, are publicly traded. We find that the SRISK is the best predictor of systemic risk among the 3 systemic risk measures, since it is the most correlated with the stress test results.

These concentrated commonalities have far reaching implications on systemic financial risk. Based on the commonality structure of banks' balance sheets, we construct a bipartite financial network and design novel indicators to analyze the systemic risk of China's banking system and its relation to the real economy. Results show that (1) considering the interconnectivity, indirect loss arising from common exposure is much higher than direct loss; (2) concentrated common exposure to mortgage is demonstrated to be the most significant source of systemic vulnerability in China; (3) the derived contagion network shows the property of “small world”, which plays an important role in generating systemic risk, amplified non-linearly by multi-rounds of contagion; (4) a bank's systemic importance/vulnerability depends on complex interaction between asset volume, leverage rate, and its commonality of asset composition to other banks. The model proposed in this study provides a new structural perspective to investigate the systemic risk, and a macroprudential instrument to complement existing stress testing that contributes to more efficient and precise regulations. Moreover, we contribute a ranking framework to assess each bank's systemic importance as well as vulnerability corresponding to specific real sectors. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Balance sheets; Chinese banks; Network; Systemic risk,,"Sun, X.; Center of Data Economics & Network Study, Guangdong, China; email: sunxiaoqi@szu.edu.cn",,Elsevier Inc.,10575219,,,,English,Int.

Then, based on a case study of Ant Group, this paper discusses opportunities and challenges of the Chinese authorities’ regulatory approach and derives implications for the regulation in Europe.

The more recent toxicological concerns regarding parabens are more imposing, stemming from the gravity of the noncutaneous adverse health effects for which they have been scrutinized for the past 20 years. These include endocrine activity, carcinogenesis, infertility, spermatogenesis, adipogenesis, perinatal exposure impact, and nonallergologic cutaneous, psychologic, and ecologic effects. To assert that parabens are safe for use as currently used in the cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries, all toxicological end points must be addressed. We seek to achieve perspective through this exercise: perspective for the professional assessing systemic risk of parabens by all routes of exposure. The data reviewed in this article strive to provide a balanced perspective for the consumer hopefully to allay concerns regarding the safety of parabens and facilitate an informed decision-making process. Based on currently available scientific information, claims that parabens are involved in the genesis or propagation of these controversial and important health problems are premature.

We analyze this model from a game-theoretic point of view. Every firm is a rational agent in a directed graph that has an incentive to allocate payments in order to clear as much of its debt as possible. Each edge is weighted and describes a liability between the firms. We consider several variants of the game that differ in the permissible payment strategies. We study the existence and computational complexity of pure Nash and strong equilibria, and we provide bounds on the (strong) prices of anarchy and stability for a natural notion of social welfare. Our results highlight the power of financial regulation – if payments of insolvent firms can be centrally assigned, a socially optimal strong equilibrium can be found in polynomial time. In contrast, worst-case strong equilibria can be a factor of Ω(n) away from optimal, and, in general, computing a best response is an NP-hard problem. For less permissible sets of strategies, we show that pure equilibria might not exist, and deciding their existence as well as computing them if they exist constitute NP-hard problems. © Nils Bertschinger, Martin Hoefer, and Daniel Schmand.",Equilibrium computation; Financial network; Nash equilibrium; Price of anarchy; Systemic risk,Computational complexity; Directed graphs; Finance; Game theory; Polynomial approximation; Financial networks; Financial regulations; Nash equilibria; Polynomial-time; Price of anarchy; Rational agents; Strong equilibrium; Systemic risks; Optimization,,Vidick T.,"Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9783959771344,,,English,"Leibniz Int.

This paper analyzes this intellectual shift by using discourse and citation-network analysis of the most-cited scholarly works on banking regulation and systemic risk from 1985 to 2014 and six in-depth interviews with central scholars. It demonstrates that the predominance of formalism, particularly partial equilibrium analysis, in studies on banking regulation pre-crisis impeded economists' engagement with the endogenous sources of systemic risks discussed in the systemic risk sample. These studies excluded observed phenomena that could not be accommodated in mathematical models, largely ignoring contributions based on historical and practitioners' styles of reasoning. Post-crisis, while informal analyses gain prominence in studies on banking regulation, attempts to conceptualize systemic risk as a negative externality indicate the persistence of formalism and equilibrium thinking and its concomitant epistemological limitations that stymie theoretical progress. © The Author(s) 2017.

The reluctance and inability of mainstream banks in the post-crisis years to provide credit facilities to the real economy, most critically to start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises, propelled the latest wave of financial innovation, this time under the guise of FinTech. Much has been written on the rise of FinTech in recent years, but there is still insufficient clarity about the benefits that this phenomenon is bringing to the real economy and the potential risks that can arise from its growth. This paper maps the development of FinTech lending platforms in the UK and reconceptualises the rationale for their growth. In doing that, this study focuses on the structure and operation of the main UK platforms, recognising that while some are effectively banks that adopt a technology-based business model, many platforms operate under the P2P business model. The question then is to assess the policy and regulatory approach that is relevant to UK P2P platforms. Interestingly, the emergence of P2P securitisation raises a number of regulatory and policy questions, because longer intermediation chains typical of securitisation may well defy the social and economic purposes under which the idea of P2P developed. Furthermore, questions of systemic risk inevitably resurface in these types of transactions. Ensuing problems related to the best way to regulate these new channels of financial intermediation lead to critically evaluate the initiatives launched by the UK FCA, initially under the Innovation Hub, and more recently under the consultation for a new regulatory framework. © 2019, The Author(s).",Credit risk; Financial conduct authority; Financial intermediation; FinTech; Market-based finance; P2P lending; P2P securitisation; Systemic risk,,"Bavoso, V.; University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom; email: vincenzo.bavoso@manchester.ac.uk",,Palgrave Macmillan,17456452,,,,English,J.

Inevitably, in this paper we have looked at the both bankruptcy prediction and the factors that lead to bankruptcy. The dataset for this study was acquired from Kaggle, which was based on the Taiwan Economic Journal, from 1999 to 2009. The corporate statutes of the Taiwan Stock Exchange were utilized to determine a company's bankruptcy. It was a highly imbalanced dataset having 220 Non-bankrupt and 6,599 bankrupt data. We have used Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, XGBoost, and LightGBM classifiers regarding bankruptcy prediction. On the other hand, to find the factors that lead to bankruptcy, we did an empiric analysis for which we calculated fourteen statistical values of both bankrupted and non-bankrupted features and saw their cosine similarities. These factors will help any financial company to plan its financial ratios for preventing bankruptcy. Here we got the best performance from the Artificial Neural Network with 98.64% accuracy. And we found four factors that were responsible for the bankruptcy in our dataset. Here, the factors determining bankruptcy are crucial because by finding these factors and the likelihood of bankruptcy, companies can take the necessary steps to plan their financial ratios and ensure the solvency of their businesses. © 2022 IEEE.",Bankruptcy; Bankruptcy Factors; Forecasting; SMOTE,Data mining; Decision trees; Finance; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Bankruptcy; Bankruptcy factor; Bankruptcy prediction; Economic journals; Financial crisis; Financial environments; Financial ratios; Monitoring methods; SMOTE; Systemic risks; Forecasting,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,9781665483971,,,English,"Int.

From the perspective of time dimension and space dimension, the causal complex network among financial institutions is analyzed with the dynamic variation of systemic risk measured. One improvement is that the CAPM is employed to filter out the market risk. Moreover, we study the contribution of individual financial firm to the systemic risk through three well known systemic risk measures containing the systemic risk index (SRISK), the marginal expected shortfall (MES) and the conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR). The proposed methodology framework is applied to the banks, securities and insurance companies in Chinese financial markets. Empirical researches find that the causal network of Chinese financial entities possesses small world and scale free properties, with the number of connections increasing dramatically in turmoil periods, indicating stronger interconnectedness in the financial system during crisis. Moreover, the network based connectedness measures through topology structure analysis can identify and quantify the financial crisis, serving as significant systemic risk indicators. In addition, different systemic risk measures employed in our framework can identify similar rankings of risky financial firms quantitatively, which provide references for regulations. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Causal complex network; Interconnectedness; Marginal expected shortfall (MES); Systemic risk,,"Gong, X.-L.; School of Economics, China; email: qdgongxiaoli@126.com",,Elsevier Inc.,10590560,,,,English,Int.

However, an analysis materials on the subject shows that work in this area is fragmented. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for diagnosing and regulating the stability of financial development based on a systematic approach. The study used systematic, comparative, and GEO analysis, econometric methods. As a result, new indicators have been developed to diagnose the financial development of countries. The authors also propose criteria, which could be used to signal the need for countercyclical regulation tools. The novelty of the study lies in a systematic approach to the diagnosis and regulation of the stability of financial development. The systemic nature of the study is ensured by the application of the statistical framework of the System of National Accounts. Testing of the developed indicators and criteria was carried out in relation to the OECD+ (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries for the period 2007-2020. As a result of the testing, a rating of countries was built according to the level of stability of financial development. This rating highlighted leading countries as well as countries generating systemic risks. The study also assessed the legal grounds behind the introduction of a countercyclical markup by a number of countries. The new diagnostic and regulatory system has a number of advantage-it is highly representative and objective by nature, and has a wide range of applications. The use of this system will improve the complexity and quality of diagnosing and regulating the stability of financial development at the national and global levels, as well as increase the effectiveness of public decision-making.

They are characterised by complexity, transboundary cascading effects, non-linear stochastic developments, tipping points, and lag in perception and regulation. Disasters need to be analysed in the context of vulnerabilities of infrastructure, industrial activities, structural developments and behavioural patterns which amplify or attenuate the impact of hazards. In particular, disasters are triggered by chains of events that often amplify and also multiply damages. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies the concept of systemic risks to disasters more precisely to the combination of natural and human-induced disasters. The paper refers to the International Risk Governance Council’s Risk Governance Framework and applies this framework to the systemic aspects of disaster risks. Findings: The paper maps out strategies for inclusive governance of systemic risks for disaster prevention and mitigation. Furthermore, the paper highlights policy implications of these strategies and calls out for an integrated, inclusive and adaptive management approach for the systemic aspects of disaster risks. Originality/value: The paper fulfils the identified need to analyse disaster risks in the context of vulnerabilities of infrastructure, industrial activities, structural developments and behavioural patterns which amplify or attenuate the impact of hazards. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Complex systems; Disaster risk; Public involvement; Risk communication; Risk governance; Stakeholder engagement; Systemic risks,,"Schweizer, P.-J.; Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies eVGermany; email: pia-johanna.schweizer@iass-potsdam.de",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,09653562,,,,English,Disaster Prev.

Consumers typically rely on a single AV product to detect and block possible malware infections, while corporations often install multiple security products, activate several layers of defenses, and establish security policies among employees. However, if a better security posture should lower the risk of malware infections, then the actual extent to which this happens is still under debate by risk analysis experts. Moreover, the difference in risks encountered by consumers and enterprises has never been empirically studied by using real-world data.In fact, the mere use of third-party software, network services, and the interconnected nature of our society necessarily exposes both classes of users to undiversifiable risks: Independently from how careful users are and how well they manage their cyber hygiene, a portion of that risk would simply exist because of the fact of using a computer, sharing the same networks, and running the same software.In this work, we shed light on both systemic (i.e., diversifiable and dependent on the security posture) and systematic (i.e., undiversifiable and independent of the cyber hygiene) risk classes. Leveraging the telemetry data of a popular security company, we compare, in the first part of our study, the effects that different security measures have on malware encounter risks in consumer and enterprise environments. In the second part, we conduct exploratory research on systematic risk, investigate the quality of nine different indicators we were able to extract from our telemetry, and provide, for the first time, quantitative indicators of their predictive power.Our results show that even if consumers have a slightly lower encounter rate than enterprises (9.8% vs. 12.0%), the latter do considerably better when selecting machines with an increasingly higher uptime (89% vs. 53%). The two segments also diverge when we separately consider the presence of Adware and Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA) and the generic samples detected through behavioral signatures: While consumers have an encounter rate for Adware and PUA that is 6 times higher than enterprise machines, those on average match behavioral signatures 2 times more frequently than the counterpart. We find, instead, similar trends when analyzing the age of encountered signatures, and the prevalence of different classes of traditional malware (such as Ransomware and Cryptominers). Finally, our findings show that the amount of time a host is active, the volume of files generated on the machine, the number and reputation of vendors of the installed applications, the host geographical location, and its recurrent infected state carry useful information as indicators of systematic risk of malware encounters. Activity days and hours have a higher influence in the risk of consumers, increasing the odds of encountering malware of 4.51 and 2.65 times. In addition, we measure that the volume of files generated on the host represents a reliable indicator, especially when considering Adware. We further report that the likelihood of encountering Worms and Adware is much higher (on average 8 times in consumers and enterprises) for those machines that already reported this kind of signature in the past. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to the understanding of the mechanisms that can lead to a breakdown of this network. This can happen when the existing financial links turn from being a means of risk diversification to channels for the propagation of risk across financial institutions. In this review article, we summarize recent developments in the modeling of financial systemic risk. We focus, in particular, on network approaches, such as models of default cascades due to bilateral exposures or to overlapping portfolios, and we also report on recent findings on the empirical structure of interbank networks.

By employing Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we identify configurations of country-level factors, i.e., country profiles, based on their effectiveness in engendering trade resilience. These factors include social and economic globalization, logistics performance, healthcare preparedness, national government response, and income level.

We document that the two groups and the financial system become more interconnected during the global financial crisis when linkages across groups grow. In contrast, during tranquil times linkages within groups prevail. Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) contribute most to system-wide distress but are also most exposed. There are more links coming from G-SIBs to other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) than the other way around, confirming the role of G-SIBs as major risk transmitters in the financial system. The two groups and the global financial system tend to co-vary for periods up to 60 days Prior to their official designation as G-SIBs or O-SIIs, the prevalent news sentiment about these institutions (we measure with a textual analysis) was negative. Importantly, the systemic importance and exposure of G-SIBs and O-SIIs is perceived differently by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). © 2021",Bank networks; Bayesian graphical VAR; Interconnectedness; Systemic risk; Textual analysis,,"Andrieş, A.M.; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi and Institute for Economic Forecasting, 22 Carol I Boulevard, Romania; email: alin.andries@uaic.ro",,Elsevier B.V.,15723089,,,,English,J.

However, consistently missing from drug narratives is a deeper engagement with young people themselves on why they use drugs and an understanding of the social, political, economic and cultural forces that shape their interactions with drugs. By engaging with the lived experiences of young people in the Myanmar city of Taunggyi, this paper offers new insights into the everyday pathways and practices through which systemic risk factors–poverty, large-scale local drug production and poor welfare provision–materialise into drug harms. This paper draws attention to three factors that shape these pathways: first, the role that drug-selling and drug consumption plays in the coping strategies that people deploy in an environment of economic hardship; second, the intersections between drug use and gendered conceptions of youth; and, third, the everyday institutional practices of local authorities. Exploring young people’s testimonies offers a grounded perspective for considering what can be done to reduce drug harms in a context where the structural determinants of drug risks are deeply entrenched and, in the context of post-coup Myanmar, likely to worsen. © 2022 The Author(s).

This paper proposes a multilayer cross-shareholding network method to map the multiplex cross-shareholding relations in the global oil & gas industry chain from the reciprocated, trilateral and largest component perspectives. The results show the following: (1) The cross-shareholding behavior among the listed oil & gas companies is a more popular shareholding pattern for the energy giants (the top 17.49% of companies that make up approximately 60.43% of the total market value). (2) Few (only 9 pairs between different companies) are reciprocated, and most of them belong to Israel, Japan, India, etc. (3) The “co-shareholder type” is the most critical trilateral relation in the global oil & gas industry. (4) The companies from Israel, Japan, and the Marshall Islands formed powerful alliances in different single layers, and the companies from Japan and India formed powerful alliances with cross-layer cross-shareholding relations.

Our findings show that the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have an impact on the dynamic connectedness of the whole system, which peaks at about 60% toward the end of 2019. According to net total directional connectedness over a quantile, throughout the 2020–2022 timeframe, natural gas and crude oil are net shock transmitters, while the CV, clean energy, solar energy, and green bonds consistently receive all other indicators. Specifically, pairwise connectedness indicates that the CV appears to be a net transmitter of shocks to all energy indicators before the COVID-19 outbreak but acts as a net receiver of shocks from clean energy, wind energy, and green bonds in late 2020. The CV mostly has spillover effects on green bonds. The primary net transmitter of shocks to the Crypto market is crude oil.

However, prior research tends to generate reactive systemic risk measures, in the sense that the measure surges after the crisis starts. Few of them succeed in warning of financial crises in advance. In this paper, we first sketch a toy model that produces normal mixture distributions based on a dynamic regime switching model. We derive that the relative concavity among various indices tends to increase before a crisis. Using Polymodel theory, we introduce a measure of concavity as a crisis risk indicator, and test it against known crises observed in the past. We validate this indicator by a trading strategy holding long or short positions on the S&P 500 Index, depending on the indicator value. © 2022",financial crisis; investment strategy; nonlinearity; Polymodel; Systemic risk,Economics; Finance; Financial crisis; Investment strategy; Nonlinearity; Normal mixtures; Polymodel; Research topics; Risk measures; Risk predictions; Systemic risks; Toy models; Risk assessment,"Kuang, Y.; State University of New York at Stony BrookUnited States; email: ykuang04@gmail.com",,American Institute of Mathematical Sciences,21646074,,,,English,J.

Since the start of the pandemic, many scholars have investigated the issue of food safety through different lenses. In this review, two research thrusts were identified, the epidemiology of the virus and food safety oversight. Both were challenged by the pandemic in Canada and elsewhere. In this paper, we first present how Canada experienced the pandemic. We then present how epidemiology and food safety oversight were affected by the virus and how the spread exposed gaps in Canada’s food safety system. We explain how Canada was not adequately prepared to face the food safety challenges posed by SARS‐ CoV‐2. The review ends with an explanation on how risk perceptions will be altered by the pandemic in Canada and how food safety systems will adjust to better anticipate systemic risks in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: This study included 3405 Japanese community dwellers who were ≥40 years of age and enrolled in the Hisayama Study. This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2017 to 2018. A glaucoma screening test was performed using stereo fundus images and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Glaucoma was defined based on the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria. Results: The prevalence of glaucoma was 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7–8.6) overall. The prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0– 6.6); that of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5–1.1); and that of exfoliation glaucoma was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.7–1.4). In addition to aging, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02–1.33), higher intraocular pressure (OR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01–1.12), longer axial length (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.31–1.59), and thinner central corneal thickness (CCT) (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04–1.15) were significant risk factors for POAG. Diabetes (OR = 2.81; 95% CI, 1.19– 6.62) was a significant risk factor for PACG, and diabetes (OR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03–4.47) and thinner CCT (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02–1.28) were significant risk factors for exfoliation glaucoma. Conclusions: The prevalence of glaucoma was approximately 8%, probably due to the increase in the Japanese aging population. Not only ocular factors but also lower eGFR for POAG and diabetes for PACG and exfoliation glaucoma were risk factors in a general Japanese population. Translational Relevance: Systemic factors such as eGFR and diabetes must also be considered when implementing preventive measures against glaucoma. © 2022 The Authors.",epidemiology; glaucoma; population-based study; systemic risk factors,"adult; Article; body mass; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; estimated glomerular filtration rate; eye examination; glaucoma; gonioscopy; human; human experiment; hypertension; interferometry; intraocular pressure; Japanese (people); middle aged; open angle glaucoma; optical coherence tomography; oral glucose tolerance test; prevalence; pseudoexfoliation; risk factor; screening test; secondary glaucoma; slit lamp microscopy; systolic blood pressure; aged; closed angle glaucoma; glaucoma; Japan; oculoplethysmography; open angle glaucoma; prevalence; pseudoexfoliation; risk factor; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exfoliation Syndrome; Glaucoma; Glaucoma, Angle-Closure; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Gonioscopy; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Japan; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Tonometry, Ocular","Fujiwara, K.; Department of Ophthalmology, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Japan; email: fujiwara.kohta.103@m.kyushu-u.ac.jp",,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,21642591,,,36378141.0,English,Translational Vis.

Specifically, we analyze how monitoring by institutional investors complements or substitutes various board-level governance mechanisms in determining the systemic risk of a bank. Our empirical findings show that external (institutional ownership) and internal (board level) governance mechanisms complement each other to determine the level of systemic risk of a sample of domestic systemically important banks.

We propose a multivariate time varying Kendall’s tau estimator in a nonparametric context, allowing for local stationary variables. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator are provided. A simulation study is conducted which supports the idea of better performance than other related methods in many complex scenarios. The proposal is used to draw up a daily estimation of the dependence between European financial market indexes. Nonparametric conditional quantiles are estimated to detect any influence of the degree of dependence on the market returns. That dependence emerges as an important factor in the Euro Stoxx distribution. It is noteworthy that the Kendall’s tau only depends on the multivariate copula, so the effect is not due to hidden effects of the marginals. Local Granger causality is tested and evidence is found that the degree of dependence affects the Euro Stoxx returns in the left tail of the distribution. We believe that these results encourage further research into the effect of diversification in quantiles, linked to the factors behind systemic risk.

Based on this model, we portray the lower-tail dependence between the return of WIND first-level industry and CSI-300 index as a proxy variable for the industry risk in China's stock market, and use the VAR-GARCH-in-mean model based on BEKK-GARCH to deconstruct the different impact of the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on industry risk of the first and second moments in terms of four policy categories, namely fiscal policy, monetary policy, trade policy, and foreign exchange rate and capital account policy. The results are followed. Firstly, the risk of Consumer Discretionary is averagely the highest, while the risk of Utilities remains the lowest. Secondly, category-specific EPU has no significant mean spillover to the risk of overall industries, while the variance spillover is significant for all the cases. Thirdly, except for Real Estate, the GARCH-in-mean effect is not significant of EPU on industry risks. Further more, all those three kinds of impact show industrial heterogeneities. To avoid systemic risks, we advise that the issue of economic policy should be forward-looking, consistent, and targeted, especially for sensitive industries. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Copula; Economic policy uncertainty; GARCH-in-mean; Industry risk; Spillover effects,,"Wang, J.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: jiewang_edu@163.com",,Elsevier Inc.,10629408,,,,English,North Am.

The equivalence among Price-To-Earnings (P/E) ratios, node degree distribution and capital allocation distribution is established with a Havel-Hakimi network structure. Such equivalences allow network entropy to be a measure of portfolio diversification and robustness. Our empirical analysis finds a linear correlation between in-sample network entropy and out-of-sample portfolio returns. Then, a return-entropy efficient frontier is introduced to interpret the return-diversification trade-offs. Further, we compare the out-of-sample performance of portfolios optimized with PEN analysis against those optimized with mean-variance analysis, showing that PEN-optimized portfolios outperform mean-variance efficient portfolios in returns, given a low-To-medium P/E ratio level. This outcome accords with the P/E effect that stocks with low P/E ratios are undervalued and will provide increased returns in the future. In addition, regarding global financial risk events such as the financial crisis in 2008, the Euro debt crisis in 2013 and Brexit in 2016, this study finds that the PEN-optimized portfolio size increased significantly (even to more than 300 stocks) to mitigate systemic risk, while mean-variance efficient portfolios were not sufficiently diversified. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",diversification; entropy; Havel-Hakimi network; portfolio optimization; Price-earnings ratio,,"Yang, H.; Department of Statistics and Finance, Hefei, China; email: yhc0147@ustc.edu.cn",,World Scientific,02179792,,IJPBE,,English,Int.

This paper proposes a dynamic complex interbank network system model with shadow banking in which the dynamic complex interbank network system differs from the traditional banking network and is formed by the interrelated business between shadow banks and commercial banks to explore the effect of shadow banking on the systemic risk. The results show that the existence of shadow banking will increase the systemic risk, accelerate the speed of bankruptcy of banks, reduce the survival ratio of banks, and increase the strength of central bank assistance.

Methods: Three hundred and seventy-two community residents (222 females, 150 males; mean ± SD age, 39 ± 22 years) were recruited in a cross-sectional study. Past medical history, dry eye symptomology, ocular surface characteristics, and tear film quality were evaluated for each participant within a single clinical session. The diagnosis of dry eye disease, aqueous tear deficiency, and meibomian gland dysfunction were based on the global consensus recommendations of the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society's Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II) and International Workshop on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. Results: Overall, 109 (29%) participants fulfilled the TFOS DEWS II criteria for dry eye disease, 42 (11%) had aqueous tear deficiency, and 95 (26%) had meibomian gland dysfunction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that systemic rheumatologic disease and antidepressant medication were independently associated with aqueous tear deficiency (both p < 0.05). Significant risk factors for meibomian gland dysfunction included age, East Asian ethnicity, migraine headaches, thyroid disease, and oral contraceptive therapy (all p ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: Both etiological subtypes of dry eye disease were associated with a number of systemic risk factors. These findings would support routine systemic inquiry of dry eye disease and associated systemic conditions and medications, in order to facilitate opportunistic screening and timely inter-disciplinary referral where necessary. © 2020",Dry eye; Epidemiology; Lacrimal gland; Meibomian gland; Ocular surface; Risk factor; Tear film,antidepressant agent; oral contraceptive agent; adult; aged; aqueous tear deficiency; Article; clinical assessment; consensus; controlled study; cross-sectional study; depression; dry eye; ethnicity; eye disease assessment; female; headache; human; international workshop on meibomian gland dysfunction; major clinical study; male; meibomian gland dysfunction; migraine; New Zealand; psychopharmacotherapy; rheumatic disease; risk factor; systemic disease; tear film; tear film and ocular surface society dry eye workshop ii; thyroid disease; adolescent; dry eye; lacrimal fluid; meibomian gland; middle aged; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dry Eye Syndromes; Female; Humans; Male; Meibomian Glands; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Risk Factors; Tears; Young Adult,"Craig, J.P.Private Bag 92019, New Zealand; email: jp.craig@auckland.ac.nz",,Elsevier Inc.,15420124,,,32311433.0,English,Ocul.

Firms can be hit by cost or demand shocks, which can cause defaults. These shocks propagate through the supply chain network via input-output linkages between buyers and suppliers. Firms endogenously take contingency plans to mitigate the impact generated from disruptions. We show that, as long as firms have large initial equity buffers, network fragility is low if both buyer diversification and supplier diversification are low. We find that a single-sourcing strategy is beneficial for a firm only if the default probability of the firm’s supplier is low.

Basel Committee (BIS) has introduced a set of regulations to identify such banks, defined global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the robustness of the BIS's methodology. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach is considered, specifically HSMAA (hierarchy stochastic multiobjective acceptability analysis), which can take into account uncertainty on BIS's criteria weights as standard SMAA, but also uncertainty with respect to the subcriteria of the considered criteria. The results are analyzed to provide insights into the robustness of the BIS's methodology. Findings: The obtained results indicate that overall the BIS's methodology does not appear robust. Within the two uncertainty scenarios considered, the results show a great variability in identifying the G-SIBs' systemic risk. Originality/value: The paper proposes an analytical way to assess the robustness of the BIS's methodology. Moreover, the authors’ analysis reveals a great variability on the results, which highlight different issues for banks, regulators and enterprises. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Banking supervision; Entrepreneurship; Global systemically important banks; Hierarchy stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis; Multiple criteria decision aiding; Policymaking,,"Angilella, S.; Department of Economics and Business, Italy; email: silvia.angilella@unict.it",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,00251747,,,,English,Manage.

Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations to avert another market collapse, such as the collateralization of interbank (counterparty) derivatives trades to mitigate systemic risk. A limiting factor is the availability of proprietary bank trading data. Even if this hurdle could be overcome, however, analyses would still be hampered by segmented financial markets where banks trade under different regulatory systems. We therefore adapt a simulation technology, combining advances in graph theoretic models and machine learning to randomly generate entire financial systems derived from realistic distributions of bank trading data. We then compute counterparty credit risk under various scenarios to evaluate and predict the impact of financial regulations at all levels—from a single trade to individual banks to systemic risk. We find that under various stress testing scenarios collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations. Moreover, the concentration of credit risk does not necessarily correlate monotonically with systemic risk. While the analysis focuses on counterparty credit risk, the method generalizes to other risks and metrics in a straightforward manner. © Copyright © 2019 O'Halloran and Nowaczyk.",artificial intelligence; data science; financial regulation; financial risk analytics; graph theoretic models; machine learning; stochastic Linear Gauss-Markov model; systemic risk,,"O'Halloran, S.; Columbia UniversityUnited States; email: so33@columbia.edu",,Frontiers Media S.A.,26248212,,,,English,Frontier.

Contrary to standard practice, we estimate the credit value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) of a global loan portfolio using CDS spreads because credit derivatives incorporate forward-looking information on future systemic shocks that might be essential in the estimation of economic capital. We find that one-factor model can generally be a good representation of correlations in the credit market because of the high inter-sector correlations, although an appropriately chosen second factor can provide additional information for risk estimation in stressed times. We show that there were, indeed, signs of stress in the credit market that were not incorporated in the determination of economic capital during the crisis and that some financial institutions did not consider properly. The overall impression is that it is not so much that risk models were over-simplified to anticipate the financial crisis but rather, that they were backward-looking.

The proposed measure of systemic risk considers the score of the conditional density as the main driver of time-varying dynamics of tail dependence among financial institutions. Not only does the GAS Copula-based CoVaR enable us to monitor the amount of systemic risk posed by different financial institutions at a specific date, it also allows for the forecasting of systemic risk over time. Our results based on a sample of daily equity returns collected from January 2000 to July 2017 surprisingly show that in South Africa, insurers are the most systemically risky compared to banks and other financial sectors. Moreover, we make use of flexible GAS Copulas in order to approximate complex dependence structures. To validate the robustness of our results over time, we divide our sample period into two sub samples, namely the pre-crisis period (January 2000 to June 2007) and the post-crisis period (January 2010 to July 2017).

We apply different performance measures, namely, the Sharpe, Roy, Treynor, Omega, and Alpha Jensen. These are based on the capital asset pricing model-exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (CAPM-EGARCH) model, and the cross wavelet transform approach, the wavelet approach, and the conditional value at risk (CVaR). Results using the Alpha Jensen performance measure show that Islamic equity returns dominate conventional equity returns during the full sample period. However, the pre-crisis periods are dominated by higher conventional equity returns, irrespective of the return measures employed. During the GFC, the ESDC, and the post-crisis periods, Islamic equity returns dominate their conventional counterparts. Moreover, the co-movements of sectors vary over time and across frequencies and depend on major events. We find that portfolios consisting of Islamic and conventional equity markets within the industrial and utilities sectors offer maximum risk reductions in terms of portfolio value at risk (VaR). Whereas, portfolios consisting of Islamic and conventional stock markets of aggregate equities, basic materials, consumer services, and technologies highlight traces of low-diversification benefits across the entire sampling period. The consumer goods, energy, financial, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors highlight the least diversification benefits in terms of differences in portfolio VaR.

Moving along this line, the book under review shows that the protection of financial nationalism contributes to the creation of global systemic risks. In this review essay, I discuss the three overarching themes addressed in the book - namely, the logic of financial nationalism, the role of soft and hard law in the international governance of finance and the related problem of compliance. International financial law is still emerging as a discipline and the issues under discussion are at the heart of the ongoing debate about how to devise adequate international structures and international norms to govern markets and control systemic risks in finance. Proceeding from a critical approach to the international law of finance, I analyse the book's focus on financial nationalism and the limits of its juxtaposition with the economic logic of externalities; the case for strengthened formalization; and, finally, the extent to which the theoretical framework proposed in the book is relevant for rethinking the logic and prospect of compliance in international finance. © 2020 The Author(s).",,,"Borlini, L.; International Law, Italy; email: leonardo.borlini@unibocconi.it",,Oxford University Press,09385428,,,,English,Eur.

This study aims to investigate the Islamic banks systemic risk contagion with major banks from China and India. Design/methodology/approach: Having the option pricing theory in the backdrop, the authors calculated three different distance to risk measurements (default, insolvency and capital). The authors have included top six listed globally influential Islamic banks, top seven Indian banks and top eight Chinese banks based on their net asset value. They then measured the banks’ extreme shocks based on the extreme value theory by using the logistic regression model. These extreme shocks helped the authors to map the spillover among the selected banks from multiple regions. Findings: The authors have found strong evidences of directional risk spillover among the banks in this sample. Islamic banks are receiving a significant risk spillover from the other sample banks but transmitting less toward the other banks from India and China. Hence, there is strong one-directional risk contagion toward the Islamic banks in the study sample. Practical implications: This research would be particularly useful to the regulators and bankers from emerging and Islamic markets to understand the conniving nature of the crisis by effectively mapping the source, destination and implementation of the shock transmission mechanism of the potential financial contagion. Originality/value: Even though the corresponding banking among the top Islamic banks from the Middle East and Southeast Asian countries, and banks from India and China, is on the rise, the assessment of risk among these banks has been limited. In particular, the authors extended on the extreme value theory to focus on the wider impact of spillover, including significant direction of contagion from non-Islamic banks to Islamic banks. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Distance to capital; Distance to default; Emerging market banks; Extreme value theory; Islamic banks,,"Choudhury, T.; Edith Cowan UniversityAustralia; email: t.choudhury@ecu.edu.au",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,17538394,,,,English,Int.

The asset-pricing models enrich our investigations into housing markets from three perspectives: housing boom–bust, volatile–calm, and factors’ time-varying impact regimes. The findings indicate that state-level housing returns all show significant exposure to systemic risk of housing markets, but the demographic and economic factors’ explanatory powers for housing returns differ across markets. Although the liquidity factor is significant under all three frameworks, the inventory and credit factors show significant impacts only in the impact-switching specification. There are differences in the responses of housing returns to various risk factors and shifts in housing regimes across state housing markets, depending on whether the states exhibited housing bubbles. The results suggest that an effective housing stabilization mechanism must be capable of tracking shifts in the relations between housing markets and risk factors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,"Huang, M.; Department of Business Administration, Taiwan; email: meichihuang@mail.ntpu.edu.tw",,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,13670271,,,,English,Int.

In this context, cascading effects and risks arising from interdependent Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are of particular interest. The systemic risk assessment is implemented as a GIS-based tool to support decision makers in a risk-based maintenance strategy. Methodology: A framework based on a chain of interdependent risks of different levels of the system represents the base model. The interlinkages of industries are quantified by Input-Output-Modeling and the spatial dimension is implemented as a GIS-based decision tool. Findings: From an analytical perspective, the close interconnection of the systems' levels (subsystems) under consideration can be traced. The results highlight critical buildings leading to potentially serious impacts on industry and population if the infrastructure elements are not maintained. Research limitations: This research is focused on the framework and impacts on interdependent CIs, while work on the vulnerability of constructions and population protection, which complements our approach, is explored in more depth elsewhere. Practical implications: Maintenance of infrastructure elements should be more risk-based than time-oriented to avoid potential damage and reduce impacts. Originality: We examine the interconnected subsystems construction, industry and population in an aggregated risk framework to quantify risks stemming from complex infrastructure interdependencies with waterways as rarely explored infrastructure in this context. The implementation of a decision support tool for infrastructure operators as risk dashboard enables the integration of the approach into everyday infrastructure risk management. © 2022 The Authors",Empirical; GIS; Input-output-model; Risk; Waterways,decision making; empirical analysis; GIS; infrastructure planning; input-output analysis; repair; risk assessment; vulnerability; waterway transport,"Wehrle, R.; Karlsruhe Institute for Technology, Germany; email: rebecca.wehrle@kit.edu",,Elsevier Ltd,25900617,,,,English,Prog.

The most widely accepted measures of systemic risk are the CoVaR (Adrian and Brunnermeier 2016), the Marginal Expected Shortfall (Acharya et al. 2009, 2012), and the SRISK (Brownlees and Engle 2017). While being highly effective in gauging different dimensions of systemic risk stemming from distressed financial companies, these indicators are based on stock market and balance sheet data, which are rarely available for sovereigns. Therefore, the traditional systemic risk measures cannot be directly applied to quantify sovereign default risk.

Novelty: The regulatory and supervisory function has evolved into a critical factor in management of the financial system stability. Rethinking of the essence of the financial integral regulation has allowed distinguishing three separate directions: ensuring of financial stability, macroprudential oversight and regulation of moral hazard risk in the banking sector, financial institutions' business behavior and limitation of the intention to establish the regulatory arbitrage. Practical Value: In countries, that have adopted the integral regulation of the financial market, in relation to all its sectors, the authors propose to develop and apply standards of the moral hazard risk regulation in the banking sphere and the business behavior of financial institutions; universal standards and technologies of regulation and supervision in order to limit the establishment of regulatory arbitrage; leveling of systemic risks of financially-credit sphere. © 2018 Shaker and Shaker.",Banking system; Financial system; Megaregulator; Microfinancial organizations; Non-credit financial organizations; The role of the Bank of Russia,,"Shaker, I.E.; Department of Financial Markets and Banks, Russian Federation; email: ish7@bk.ru",,Lifescience Global,19297092,,,,English,J.

Distress of a single CCP might be transferred to clearing members and others CCPs, thereby endangering EU monetary and fiscal stability. However, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) has left fiscal responsibility as well as day-to-day supervision of EU-based CCPs (EU-CCPs) at the national level, albeit cross-border colleges of authorities can overturn key decisions of national supervisors. The Commission concluded that these supervisory arrangements needed to be reformed because they hamper the development of a single coherent EU approach to CCP supervision. Although the Commission had proposed to centralise EU-CCP supervision in the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the final 2019 CCP Supervision Regulation seeks to improve EMIR’s ineffective collegial framework by establishing an internal CCP Supervisory Committee within ESMA. Nevertheless, the continuing lack of loss mutualisation would keep on hindering the development of a single approach to EU-CCP supervision. Moreover, the new regulation adds another layer of complexity to the EMIR framework and clashes with the European monetary constitution. If an agreement on loss mutualisation was reached, EU-CCP supervision should be centralised in two EU bodies along objective lines: while the European Central Bank should be tasked with EU-CCP prudential supervision, ESMA should be responsible for EU-CCP conduct of business supervision. This framework would improve EU-CCP supervision and fit in with the current EU governance at once. © 2021, The Author(s).",CCP; ECB; ESMA; Governance; Institutional design; Supervision,,"Canini, R.; Probationer Research Student, United Kingdom; email: romualdo.canini@spc.ox.ac.uk",,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,15667529,,,,English,Eur.

It began with research meetings in the old Economic Department of the Faculty of Economics in the 1990s, where we imagined possible ways of introducing heterogeneity in traditional economic analysis arriving to the present day with the latest research which analyses interaction networks between economic agents (e.g., bank-firm), underlining the importance of composition effects and the emergence of macro-level properties that cannot be limited to the behavior of a “representative agent”. In fact, from the very beginning this research group has believed in the importance of analyzing the distribution of the characteristics of economic individuals (income, wealth, etc.) and of their direct interactions mediated by a network. Recent developments, using the agent-based methodology (i.e. an approach with interacting heterogeneous agents that simulates, through the use of computers, the evolution of complex economic systems), focus on the role of financial fragility, inequality, systemic risk and the crises of the capitalist system, extending the framework to an increasingly broader macroeconomic model. One of the main results concerns the role of interaction between financial factors and the real economy, through the analysis of the effects of network between the different micro-entities of the system and the potential contagion effect through the financial economics channels, also highlighting the positive role of regulation. The research group has also shown the relevance of the combination of financial fragility and inequality, two interrelated phenomena that have characterized the economic development of Western countries in recent decades and are at the root of understanding the Great Recession. Another line of research concerned the application of mathematical-statistical tools, used in particular in physics, for the analysis of economic and financial phenomena, contributing to the development of Econophysics. This research group aims to continue, over the next few years, to provide new ideas and tools to study the macroeconomic dynamics of heterogeneous agents that must coordinate in a complex system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,,,Springer International Publishing,,9783030338794; 9783030338787,,,English,The First Outst. 50 Years of “Università Politecnica Delle Marche”: Research Achievements in Social Sciences and Humanities,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149082413,scopus

We find that for the EU26 during the period 1995–2008, excessive household leverage through mortgage lending exerted a “crowding-out” effect on availability of credit to support innovation and productive investment. The crowding out effect ultimately translated into a GDP growth that was decoupled from real household income. In this article we explain that shifting credit towards mortgages and away from corporate projects is consistent with rational behaviour based on historical trends aimed at minimizing short-term risk for each individual bank. Nevertheless, as a whole, the sum of individual risk-reducing attitudes generated a long-term systemic risk. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Economic-growth; Financial-intermediation; Fixed-capital-formation,,"Samatas, A.; TeleTrade-DJ International Consulting, 88 Arch.

These systemic risks have been mitigated with the use of herbicides. The economic use of herbicides has a positive impact on reducing production costs, especially saving labor costs and time during land clearing and plant maintenance so as to increase farmers' income and profits. The efficiency of palm oil production by using herbicides and other weed control alternatives and the determinants were analyzed with a production efficiency approach. Production functions explain the technical relationship between a number of inputs used with output in a production process in palm oil sector. The regression method was carried out by utilizing survey data of palm oil farmers in Indonesia's palm oil plantation centers in Riau-, Jambi, Central-and West Kalimantan-Provinces. The results showed that the factors which significantly affect production efficiency of the sample consisting of age planting, glyphosate dosage, paraquat dosage, KCl fertilizer, and Dummy land area. Meanwhile, the use of paraquat, glyphosate, KCl, and urea was considered non optimal. Hence, it is recommended to add the use of herbicides to attain the optimization of production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Agriculture; Chlorine compounds; Costs; Efficiency; Herbicides; Maintenance; Petroleum industry; Potassium compounds; Regression analysis; Urea; Wages; Weed control; Oil production; Plant maintenance; Production cost; Production efficiency; Production function; Production process; Regression method; Systemic risks; Palm oil,"Hakim, D.B.; Department of Economics, Indonesia; email: dedi.hakim@gmail.com",Hidayat S.H.DamayantiAdam N.A.GiyantoSartiami D.,Institute of Physics Publishing,17551307,,,,English,IOP Conf.

However, with the exception of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), MAPK pathway inhibitors such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRi) or MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are associated with dose-limiting papulopustular eruptions. Interestingly, patients treated with a combination of systemic BRAFi and MEKi experience less skin toxicities than patients on monotherapy BRAFi or MEKi. The reduction in cutaneous adverse events with combination therapy is thought to be due to a paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway by BRAFi in keratinocytes carrying wildtype BRAF. Although treatment options for EGFRi- or MEKi-induced papulopustular eruptions exist, many patients still experience dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of EGFRi or MEKi. With the goal of activating MAPK signaling in the skin via BRAFi while minimizing systemic risks, we propose topical BRAFi therapy for the treatment and prevention of papulopustular eruptions due to MAPK pathway inhibitors. If effective, patients will be able to tolerate higher doses of MAPK pathway inhibitors, stay on treatment longer, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes overall. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.",,"B Raf kinase; B Raf kinase inhibitor; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; B Raf kinase; BRAF protein, human; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase; protein kinase inhibitor; Article; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; human; keratinocyte; MAPK signaling; papule; papulopustular eruption; pathophysiology; priority journal; pustule; treatment outcome; adverse event; cutaneous drug administration; dose response; drug effect; drug eruption; drug resistance; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; neoplasm; pathology; procedures; skin; Administration, Cutaneous; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Eruptions; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; ErbB Receptors; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; Skin; Treatment Outcome","Brownell, I.; Dermatology Branch, 10 Center Drive, 12N240C, United States; email: Isaac.brownell@nih.gov",,Adis,11750561,,AJCDC,32720072.0,English,Am.

In the first part, it demonstrates that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) can act as an important democratic watchdog, triggering an “early warning system”, in situations of risk of democratic recession. In the second part, it seeks to contribute to the performance of the IACHR in such a mission. It clarifies that, in the current times, an important part of democratic setbacks are expressed through processes of progressive erosion of democracy, undertaking a systemic attack on its operating conditions. Based on this observation, it proposes an “analysis matrix of systemic attack on democracy”, for the purpose of triggering the early warning system by the IACHR.

So we aimed to study the correlation between stage of DR and DME with stage of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and stage of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and to explore the systemic risk factors for DR and DME. Design and setting This single-centre retrospective observational study was conducted from December 2017 to November 2018. Participants 413 southern Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Outcome measures The correlations between stage of DR and DME with stage of eGFR/UACR were assessed by Spearman's or χ² analyses and represented with histograms. Risk factors associated with the occurrence of DR and DME were performed by logistic regression and represented with nomograms. Results Stage of DR had a positive correlation with stage of eGFR (r=0.264, p<0.001) and stage of UACR (r=0.542, p<0.001). With the stage of eGFR/UACR being more severe, the prevalence of DME became higher as well (both p<0.001). The risk factors for DR were DM duration (OR 1.072; 95% CI 1.032 to 1.114; p<0.001), stage of UACR (OR 2.001; 95% CI 1.567 to 2.555; p<0.001) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (OR 1.301; 95% CI 1.139 to 1.485; p<0.001), while risk factors for DME were stage of UACR (OR 2.308; 95% CI 1.815 to 2.934; p<0.001) and LDL (OR 1.460; 95% CI 1.123 to 1.875; p=0.008). Conclusions Among southern Chinese patients, stage of DR and DME were positively correlated with renal function, while stage of UACR performed a better relevance than stage of eGFR. © 2019 Author(s).",Chronic kidney disease; Diabetic macular oedema; Diabetic retinopathy; Nomogram; Risk factors,"albumin; apolipoprotein B; cholesterol; creatinine; D dimer; low density lipoprotein; urea; creatinine; adult; Article; China; cholesterol level; creatinine blood level; creatinine urine level; cross-sectional study; diabetic macular edema; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; disease association; disease duration; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; hypertension; kidney function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; prevalence; protein urine level; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; urea blood level; aged; albuminuria; complication; diabetic retinopathy; disease exacerbation; glomerulus filtration rate; kidney; macular edema; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; statistical model; urine; Aged; Albuminuria; China; Creatinine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Disease Progression; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney; Logistic Models; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors","Zhang, L.; Department of Ophthalmology, China; email: zhangliang5413@163.com",,BMJ Publishing Group,20446055,,,31494622.0,English,BMJ Open,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071896302,scopus

We employ three popular indicators of a financial institution’s exposure to systemic risks: the systemic risk index (SRISK) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) of Brownlees and Engle (Volatility, correlation and tails for systemic risk measurement, Social Science Research Network, Rochester, NY, 2012) and the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We use a primary database of Taiwan financial institutions for our empirical study. A panel contains data of stock market returns and balance sheets of 31 Taiwan financial institutions for 2005–2014. We focus on systemic risk analysis so as to understand the dynamics of volatility, interdependency, and risk during the recent financial crisis. We then report the time series dynamics and cross sectional rankings of these systemic risk measures. The main results indicate that although these three measures differ in their definition of the contributions to systemic risk, all are quite similar in identifying systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Moreover, we find empirical evidence that systemic risk contributions are closely related to certain institution characteristic factors. The results of the Granger causality tests prove that a systemic risk measure is a great alternative tool for monitoring early warning signals of distress in the real economy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",CoVaR; Financial crisis; MES; SRISK; Systemic risk,,"Sun, E.W.; KEDGE Business SchoolFrance; email: edward.sun@kedgebs.com",,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",02545330,,,,English,Ann.

In our model, banks are exposed to two sources of risks: market risk from their investments in assets external to the banking system and credit risk from lending in the interbank market. By and large, both risks increase during severe financial turmoil. In this scenario, the paper shows the conditions under which individual and the systemic defaults tend to coincide. This paper attempts to conduct a numerical simulation of banking ecosystems by using the actual values of financial items extracted from 89 Japanese banks’ balance sheets. From this numerical simulation, we confirm two points: (1) when financial market prices decrease due to crashes in a trend-followers-dominant market, banks lose their net worth coincidentally. Thus, the capital adequacy ratio decreases synchronously, and any bank may not provide other banks with money through the interbank markets. (2) In a contrarians-dominant or contrarians-predominant market, we observed mean-reverting fluctuations in market prices. Bankruptcies happen asynchronously, and market prices eventually decrease. However, other banks may provide the bank suffering from a shortage of assets with money through the interbank markets. We further compare the characteristics of the banking system in four types of market modes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Agent-based model; Balance sheets; Banking system; Capital adequacy ratio (CAR); Financial market; Procyclicality,,"Sato, A.-H.; Graduate School of Informatics, Yoshida Honmachi, Sakyo-ku, Japan; email: sato.akihiro.5m@kyoto-u.ac.jp",,Springer,09277099,,,,English,Comput.

Performance is measured by return on assets (ROA) and EBIT/TA. Systemic risk (SRISK) is measured by the capital shortfall indicator proposed by Brownless and Engle (2017) and total risk is standard deviation of monthly returns. We test four hypotheses associated with the dissimilarity in behavioral patterns of large and small banks during the crisis: (1) the nontraditional banking activity hypothesis, (2) the organizational structure hypothesis, (3) the accounting risk hypotheses, and (4) the accounting conservatism hypothesis. We find that behavioral dissimilarities between large and small banks can be, at least, partially related to the first three hypotheses. Non-nested test procedures show that factors associated with nontraditional activity hypothesis fit the data for performance (ROA and EBIT/TA) and total risk the best. Organizational complexity factors are the most relevant set of variables related to systemic risk of banks (SRISK). The implications of our findings are that regulators should focus on factors related these two hypotheses to optimally alter bank performance and bank contribution to systemic risk, rather than limiting bank size and bank acquisitions as proposed by Section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Act (effective January 1, 2015).

The research results indicate that the bank’s systemic risk from two risk contagion channels is significantly greater than the sum of risks from every single channel. The original DebtRank that takes only a single risk contagion channel into account will underestimate the bank’s systemic risk. In addition, state-owned commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks are the risk centers of China's banking system, whose systemic importance changes dynamically. Furthermore, the ranking of the TLAC gaps show correlation with the ranking of the DebtRanks of Chinese G-SIBs.

It brings great potential danger to the stability of financial markets. Therefore, exploring the risk spillover among the real sectors has gradually attracted the attention of scholars. This paper examines the cross-industrial tail risk spillover network in the Chinese financial market. The characteristics and the dynamic contribution of each industry in the tail risk transmission chains are explored. We use the ΔCoES-ENGDFM-LVDN model based on monthly data from 2006 to 2020 to measure the tail risk of 28 industries in China and form a cross-industrial tail risk spillover network. The results show that different industries have different levels of spillover and importance in the network. Tail risk mainly spills over from the nonfinancial sector to the financial sector. The nonbank financial industry is the main recipient of tail risk spillover and is becoming progressively more important in the risk network. In addition, with the promotion of industrial structure, emerging industries such as communications, computers, and health care have begun to play more important roles in the tail risk spillover network in China. This paper not only enriches the research in the areas of tail risk spillover and systemic risk, but also has implications for regulators to maintain financial stability and prevent financial risks. © 2022 Bohui Wen et al.",,Commerce; Health risks; Risk assessment; Financial industry; Financial sectors; Industrial structures; Model-based OPC; Network characteristics; Network effects; Risk networks; Spill over; Systemic risks; Transmission chains; Financial markets,"Hao, J.; School of Finance, China; email: haojing@tjufe.edu.cn",,Hindawi Limited,1024123X,,,,English,Math.

While the regulatory response was to mandate higher bank capital requirements during the financial cycle upswing, academic research focussed on identifying the best performing early warning indicators to forecast financial cycle fluctuations that have proven to be often unrelated to business cycle changes. To safeguard the global financial system against the financial cycle fluctuations, Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors, based on first strands of empirical evidence, proposed the credit-to-GDP gap as the headline indicator tied to the countercyclical capital buffer. However, later research on this indicator identified certain concerns, among them subpar performance for economies with short available data series. Aim of the Study: To this end this study aims to analyse various financial cycle indicators from a unique perspective of their potential viability under limited historical data availability. Methods: For this purpose, a meta-study of existing research is carried out as well as an empirical study to compare performance of certain indicators for the sample of six countries in the Central, Eastern and South-Eastern European region, where long data series are not available. Main Findings: It was found that certain approaches, among them calculation of raw credit growth rate and application of Hamilton filter, can supplement or possibly even outperform the Basel credit-to-GDP gap indicator under limited data availability. Conclusion: Author concludes that for limited time series Basel credit-to-GDP gap can be potentially outperformed by other indicators and further research in this currently under-studied field is warranted. Originality of the Paper: By using various financial cycle indicators that already proven their early warning prediction powers from previous research, this study focusses on their potential viability under limited historical data availability. Respective findings might be appreciated for supplementing pol-icy-makers’ toolkits as complementary indicators in cases where there is no available long time series for financial cycle estimation, for example, such as countries that entered market economies relatively late. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banks; Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe; Cyclical systemic risk; Early warning indicator; Financial cycle; Short time series",,,,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,15693759,,,,English,Contemp.

Taken one at a time, both fields are experiencing a veritable boom. Combined, that is to say as a regional resilience, research is only starting out, none more so than regional resilience in the context of money and finance. One reason for this is that right there the dominating, yet related concept of risk management already covers large areas like, e.g., the recognition, appraisal, governance, surveillance, and communication of risks which are relevant for resilience. Moreover, it has hitherto not been possible to define resilience in a coherent way (Hechenberger, 2017, p. 249). Searching the countless definitions for commonalities, one again and again ends up with terms like resistivity, robustness, self-help, and autonomy. Contrary to risk management, here the crisis as such is, thus, focused on. In other words: resilience designates those properties (and their appropriation) which are essential to survive crises unscathed if possible, or even come off crises in a strengthened way. Resilience does not have a passive connotation, but it is closely connected with self-reliance, autonomy, and self-help. It is necessary to overcome crises by one’s own efforts as far as possible. This is exactly where the “special case of money” already becomes apparent. Hardly any other system is more complex and more interconnected than the modern system of money and finance; even regional structures are integrated, after all. Insofar, there is no beyond the system. The resulting proverbial systemic risk is ever-present. Plus, the last crisis which is basically still enduring has revealed that, if indeed something of the kind is to be solved, it can only be done together with united forces. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Elisa Innerhofer, Martin Fontanari and Harald Pechlaner; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,"Hechenberger, G.; ecKing-group, Austria",,Taylor and Francis,,9781351331937; 9781138572683,,,English,Destination Resil.: Challenges and Opportunities for Destination Management and Gov.,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045353887,scopus

Using a sample of Chinese listed commercial banks over the period 2005 − 2018, this research conducted pooled OLS and found evidence that economic uncertainty significantly increases bank risk and lowers profitability. Furthermore, we constructed a partial equilibrium model to explain how risk governance alters the risk-increasing effect and profit-decreasing effect of economic uncertainty on bank risk and profitability. Consistent with theory, empirical results suggested the effects of economic uncertainty on bank risk and performance tend to be considerably weaker when there exists a strong risk governance mechanism. These findings stand when subjected to several endogeneity and robustness checks.

Observations: We report a case of surgically-induced necrotizing scleritis after strabismus surgery in a 61-year-old gentleman with gout and a subconjunctival abscess. Surgical drainage of the subconjunctival abscess led to a diagnosis of scleral melt which was subsequently treated with a tectonic corneal graft along with aggressive medical management. Over the following eight months, the patient showed no signs of endophthalmitis, graft necrosis, nor graft dehiscence, and serial anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated anatomic stability. Conclusions and importance: This case offers further insights into a rare but vision-threatening and potentially life-threatening diagnosis. In conjunction with aggressive local and systemic treatment, tectonic lamellar keratoplasty provides good therapeutic and tectonic results for scleral necrosis after strabismus surgery. This case also demonstrates the importance of screening for associated systemic risk factors in any patient with scleritis for appropriate, targeted therapy. © 2018 The Author",Corneal graft; Gout; Optical coherence tomography; Strabismus; Subconjunctival abscess; Surgically induced necrotizing scleritis,alcohol; allopurinol; antibiotic agent; clindamycin; eye drops; steroid; uric acid; vancomycin; adult; alcohol consumption; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; best corrected visual acuity; case report; clinical article; cornea transplantation; divergent strabismus; eye discharge; eye pain; glaucoma; gout; human; male; medial rectus muscle; medical history; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; postoperative complication; scleritis; slit lamp microscopy; smoking; strabismus; strabismus surgery; surgical drainage; surgically induced necrotizing scleritis,"Ram, R.; Texan Eye, 1700 S Mopac, United States; email: RadhaRamMD@gmail.com",,Elsevier Inc,24519936,,,,English,Am.

Furthermore we add time dynamics for this measure, which is described by a GAS model. We motivate the quality of FSDI by comparing it to the risk measure proposed by Segoviano and Goodhart (2009), the Bank Stability Index (BSI), through a horse race based on the ideas of Rodríguez-Moreno and Peña (2013).

The SR, for different levels of the initial shock, is computed for institutions in the Brazilian interbank market by applying the differential DebtRank methodology. The financial institution(FI)-specific determinants of SR are evaluated through two machine learning techniques: XGBoost and random forest. Shapley values analysis provided a better interpretability for our results. Furthermore, we performed this analysis separately for banks and credit unions. We have found the importance of a given feature in driving SR varies with i) the level of the initial shock, ii) the type of FI, and iii) the dimension of the risk which is being assessed – i.e., potential loss caused by (systemic impact) or imputed to (systemic vulnerability) the FI. Systemic impact is mainly driven by topological features for both types of FIs. However, while the importance of topological features to the prediction of systemic impact of banks increases with the level of the initial shock, it decreases for credit unions. Concerning systemic vulnerability, this is mainly determined by financial features, whose importance increases with the initial shock level for both types of FIs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Complex networks; Financial networks; Systemic risk,Decision trees; Finance; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Data driven; Financial institution; Financial networks; Financial variables; Interbank market; Machine learning techniques; Network topology; Systemic risks; Topological features; Variable topologies; Complex networks,"Alexandre, M.; Research Department, Brazil; email: michel.alexandre@bcb.gov.br",,Elsevier Ltd,09600779,,CSFOE,,English,Chaos Solitons Fractals,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119426159,scopus

Creditors are fixed claimants whose interest lies in the solvency of the borrower. Consequently, shareholders are usually thought to have optimal incentives to maximise the value of the corporation. The article challenges this common wisdom and proposes to reform bank governance granting (some) ex-ante governance rights to bank creditors. This aims at fine-tuning bank governance and incumbent substantive regulation, in particular the resolution framework for distressed banks, and enhances the quality of bank decision-making in terms of risk-taking. At the same time, the proposed reform should increase the ex-ante credibility of resolution. The second part of the article operationalises this construct focusing on the specific case of the European Banking Union and discusses the design of the governance status of bail-inable creditors. The analysis demonstrates how bail-inable creditors can correct for shareholders’ perverse incentives and make debt governance work in banking. The policy proposal advanced in the paper would complement substantive regulation and prudential oversight. The governance role of creditors has the potential to be particularly helpful in preventing disproportionate risk-taking decisions in good times, when regulatory and supervisory standards are lax and systemic risk piles-up. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Appointment rights; Bank governance; Debt governance; Financial stability; Governance arrangements; Voting rights,,"Martino, E.; University of AmsterdamNetherlands; email: e.d.martino@uva.nl",,Palgrave Macmillan,17456452,,,,English,J.

The prospect of reputational contagion events should be particularly considered by financial authorities since confidence in institutions is a crucial factor for the stability of financial systems. This work explores the hypothesis that the Social Amplification of Risk Framework and the Situational Crisis Communication Theory can be relevant foundations for a codebook to analyse cyber incidents that may generate a reputational contagion effect and trigger a systemic crisis. Directed content analysis is performed in a data corpus built from 148 news articles published by CNBC about the Equifax data breach announced in September 2017 and the Capital One data breach announced in July 2019. After a cross-case analysis, this work indicates some of the most relevant social amplification factors that may be responsible for sustained media coverage, the amplification of risk perception and the generation of secondary impacts and ripple effects. Finally, further research is suggested to link these factors to a potential systemic crisis.

Formerly Bank for International Settlements, Bern, Switzerland","Financial law and regulation have, to date, assumed that regulated activities and functions are concentrated in a single legal entity responsible and accountable for operations and compliance. Even with regard to financial market infrastructure where the regulatory perspective acknowledges the need for interoperability of many entities as a system, each entity is subject to its own rules and regulations, and can thus meet its own compliance requirements independent of other system participants. The entity-focused regulatory paradigm is under pressure in the world of DLT-based payment arrangements where some ledgers, and thus the performance of the services as such, are distributed. DLT arrangements could provide an alternative to the traditional reliance on a mutually trusted central entity to transfer funds and enable the creation of new foundational infrastructures by distributing technical functions or linking existing systems. As such, we identify and outline concepts for use cases where DLT is potentially improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, namely a Best Execution DLT, a DLT application for a Network of Central Banks, a DLT as an AML/KYC utility, as well as DLT arrangements for an Identity Platform, a Small Payments Platform and, finally, an Interoperability Platform connecting multiple closed-loop and proprietary banking systems. Despite the wide-ranging interest in DLT-based payment systems, research so far has focused on technical concepts and lacked legal details. This article seeks to fill this gap by providing an initial analysis of the legal challenges related to DLT-based payment systems. From a legal perspective, the distribution of functions in DLTs comes with new risks created from the joint performance of services and functions as main characteristic of a distributed ledger, and the need for additional agreements, ongoing coordination across, and governance arrangements among the nodes. Further, in a cross-border context, multiple regulators and courts of various countries (asking for compliance with their own set of rules and regular reporting) will be involved. All of these must decide whether for compliance with any single rule they look at the DLT as a whole (herein called ‘the ledger perspective’) or each individual node (that is each institution participating in the DLT, herein called ‘the node perspective’). Moreover, financial and private law must provide for risk allocation, liability, responsibility and accountability for all legal obligations related to each function and activity. This article examines the extent to which the ledger perspective or the node perspective should prevail against the backdrop of a range of DLT use cases, resulting in policy recommendations for regulators. In this article, we propose the adoption of what we call an enabling approach for payment systems: ledger operators must specify in a Plan of Operations subject to regulatory approval to which rights and obligations the ledger perspective applies; in the absence of such a stipulation, rules apply based on the node perspective. However, for systemic risk controls, AML/CFT, data protection and governance, as well as DLT governance, we propose a reversed default rule in which the ledger perspective prevails in the absence of rules stipulating that the node perspective applies. Finally, in private law matters, we propose protecting consumers and SME clients through a standardised payment services contract structure, without mandating details. © 2022 The Author(s).

Our results might explain why over 86% of Chinese lending platforms experience operational difficulties.1 © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Credit rating; Default risk; New borrowers; Peer-to-peer online lending,,"Zhang, T.; National School of Agricultural Institution and Development, No. 483 Wushan Rd., Tianhe Strict, China; email: tongzhang@scau.edu.cn",,Elsevier Ltd,15446123,,,,English,Finan.

However, local processes in the artery wall are becoming increasingly recognized to exacerbate atherosclerosis both in mice and humans. We show that arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) glucose metabolism markedly synergizes with metabolic syndrome in accelerating atherosclerosis progression, using a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mouse model. SMCs in proximity to atherosclerotic lesions express increased levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Cytokines, such as TNF-α produced by lesioned arteries, promote GLUT1 expression in SMCs, which in turn increases expression of the chemokine CCL2 through increased glycolysis and the polyol pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of GLUT1 in SMCs, but not in myeloid cells, accelerates development of larger, more advanced lesions in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, which also exhibits elevated levels of circulating Ly6Chi monocytes expressing the CCL2 receptor CCR2. Accordingly, monocyte tracing experiments demonstrate that targeted SMC GLUT1 overexpression promotes Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment to lesions. Strikingly, SMC-targeted GLUT1 overexpression fails to accelerate atherosclerosis in mice that do not exhibit the metabolic syndrome phenotype or monocytosis. These results reveal a potentially novel mechanism whereby arterial smooth muscle glucose metabolism synergizes with metabolic syndrome to accelerate monocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis progression.",Atherosclerosis; Glucose metabolism; Vascular Biology,,,,NLM (Medline),23793708,,,29875324.0,English,JCI Insight,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062247203,scopus

Design/methodology/approach: A single-stage panel data analysis multiple regression model that contains a mixture of quantitative and qualitative elements is used. The LLPs is a dependent variable or regressor, and non-performing loan (NPL), interest income, net profit, loans and advances and gross domestic product (GDP) are the independent variables or regressor/explanatory variables. The moderating variable is “credit risk management” (CRM) and the intervening variable is “relevance and faithful representation”. Findings: This paper suggests in LLPs, NPLs, interest income, loans and advances, net profit and GDP, as well as the moderating effect of CRM and the intervening effect of relevance and faithful representation, are determinants of the LLPs. The moderating variable CRM strengthens the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The intervening variable “relevance and faithful representation” brings about a more accurate reporting on the levels of the LLPs. Practical implications: The association of the factors is investigated further to detect possible effect of multicollinearity and research to better understand how banks manage their risk as the current investigation is limited to banks in Malaysia. Social implications: Loan loss provisioning issues of commercial banks in Malaysia are challenges for both regulators and the banking industry owing to the implementation of several new measures, the convergence with internationally accepted accounting standards and differences in loan grading and applications of different loan loss provisioning standards. Because of these challenges, Bank Negara Malaysia (the Central Bank of Malaysia) has tightened its supervision of commercial banks to ensure that banks are sufficiently and adequately provisioned. The banking sector plays a significant role, and it is important that it is resilient in the face of potential sources of systemic risk. And, like in other major ASEAN economies, the Malaysian’s financial system remains largely bank-dominated. Originality/value: This study discovers whether Malaysian banks are sufficiently provisioned for the regional financial integration under the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF) by the end of 2015, where several initiates have been initiated, including the harmonization of standards to encourage greater intra-regional investment flows and transactions and continued provisions of the much needed funds by the region’s private sectors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Banking; Corporate finance; Financial institution; Financial reporting,,"Mohd Isa, M.Y.; Bank Rakyat School of Business, Malaysia; email: mohd_yaziz@unirazak.edu.my",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,19852517,,,,English,J.

Bank regulation is strikingly not neutral in this aspect, it explicitly favors short-duration adjustable-rate loans over long-duration fixed-rate loans in the framework of the gap management. This asymmetry in the regulation creates perverse incentives both for banks and households, which can lead to aggressive risk-taking, overindebtedness of unhedged households, high procyclicality of mortgage markets, and increased systemic risks. We present a stress test model to quantify potential losses stemming from this specific risk from the perspective of lender institutions. We estimate the average extra capital that is needed to cover the additional risk of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the EU to be 0.53% of the value of the total mortgage portfolio and 1.97% of the value of the adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio.

We then test the capability of this model to match actual bank non-/defaults in the United States for the years 2008–10, where we treat the underlying liquidation dynamics as another free input parameter.

We identify the region in the parameter space where a specific dynamic leads to the best fit of the data, and in the most relevant regime (illiquid asset markets and small initial shocks) leverage targeting turns out to provide the most accurate results.

The latter prevails when the opportunity cost of liquidity is large, incentivising banks to borrow neighbors’ reserves instead of holding their own.

The primary objective was to identify causative organisms. Secondary objectives included the determination of systemic risk factors and visual prognostic factors. Design: Retrospective review Methods: 78 eyes from 62 subjects over a 21-year period from 1999 to 2020 in Auckland, New Zealand. Parameters assessed included pathologic microbial organism, clinical presentation, treatment, complications, prognostic factors, and visual outcomes. Methods: Information was collected on microbiology, treatment, visual outcomes, and complications. Results: Median age was 61.6 years and 32 subjects (51.6%) were male. Diabetes was the most common risk factor seen in 24 (38.7%) subjects. 17 subjects (27.4%) presented directly to ophthalmology and 17.4% had an initial misdiagnosis. 49 subjects (79.0%) presented with reduced vision and only 27 (43.5%) presented with pain. Hypopyon was present in 13 eyes (16.7%). Gram-positive bacteria were the most common causative organism seen in 40 (51.3%) eyes, followed by yeast and fungi in 21 (26.9%) eyes, then gram-negative bacteria seen in 17 (21.8%) eyes. Median final BCVA was 6/18. Severe vision loss occurred in 33 (42.3%) eyes and 7 (9.0%) eyes required evisceration or enucleation. Presenting visual acuity was a significant predictor of visual outcome. Conclusion: Endogenous endophthalmitis occurred at 1.9 cases per million per year.

Systemic risks are risks that threaten the systems upon which society depends, including ecosystems, social systems, financial systems, and systems of infrastructure. Such risks are typically characterised by inherent complexity, profound uncertainty, and overwhelming ambiguity. In combination, these features pose significant regulatory challenges for policy and law-makers. Examining how different types of systemic risks caused by climate change are being regulated in four different jurisdictions - the EU, the UK, the US and Australia - this book identifies deficiencies associated with regulating systemic risks using a traditional approach, based on a linear relationship between risk and regulation, which is widely used to regulate risk. The book advances a regulatory approach that is, instead, founded on the concept of ""risk governance"". This involves a structured yet flexible, holistic, interdisciplinary and inclusive basis for responding to systemic risks; and it is, this book argues, a more effective basis for regulating systemic risks given their uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. This book will appeal to academics, policy and law-makers and practitioners working at the intersection of law and policy in the areas of regulation, risk management and climate change. © 2023 Dariel De Sousa.

Several factors, both local and systemic, contribute to the onset and development of periodontal infections. Dental plaque and plaque retentive areas, such as dental calculus, and faulty restorations, are examples of the local variables. Neglected diabetes mellitus and chronic cigarette use are examples of the systemic risk factors. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evalulate the effect of patient related factors on periodontal condition. Methodology: The accessible periodontal records were reviewed retrospectively for this cross-sectional investigation. Name, occupation, and primary complaint (C/P) are only some of personal and demographic details that could be gleaned from these files. Dentist visits; tooth brushing, tooth brushing technique, brushing frequency, health records, tooth mobility, routines, and additional clinical parameters such as clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), and the gingival index (GI) are all measures of how much gum tissue has been lost. Both chronic gingivitis (CG) and chronic periodontitis (CP) were noted as diagnoses. Results: There were variations in the clinical parameters, chief complain, and occupation of males and females according to the age groups. There was an increasing of periodontal diseases in old age. Periodontal diseases are more common in males more than females. The mobility of teeth and furcation involvement increase in sever periodontis in old age. Conclusion: There are many local patient related factors that affect the periodontal condition. Periodontal diseases were found more in males than females. In addition, there were more periodontal diseases in old than young patients. © 2023 by SPC (Sami Publishing Company)",Chronic gingivitis; Chronic periodontitis; Periodontal disease; Related factors; Retrospective; Risk factors,,"Alwan, A.H.; Department of Periodontics, Iraq; email: dr_alsady@yahoo.co.uk",,Sami Publishing Company,26514702,,,,English,J.

In this work, we analyse the structure and dynamics of the cross-correlation matrix of banks’ loan portfolios in the yearly bank-firm credit network of Japan during the period from 1980 to 2012. Using the methods of Random Matrix Theory (RMT), Principal Component Analysis and complex networks, we aim to detect non-random patterns in the empirical cross-correlations as well as to identify different states of such correlations over time. Our findings suggest that although a majority of portfolio correlations between banks in lending relations to firms are contributed by noise, the top largest eigenvalues always deviate from the random bulk explained by RMT, indicating the presence of non-random patterns governing the correlation dynamics. In particular, we show that this dynamics is mainly driven by a global common factor and a couple of “groups” factors. Furthermore, different states in the credit market can be identified based on the evolution of eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors. For example, during the asset price bubble period in Japan from 1986 to 1991, we find that banks’ loan portfolios tend to be more correlated, showing a significant increase in the level of systemic risk in the credit market. In addition, building Planar Maximally Filtered Graphs from the correlations of different eigenmodes, notably, we observe that the local interaction structure between banks changes in different periods. Typically, when the dominance of a group of banks in one period gradually vanishes, the credit market starts to build-up a different structure in the next period in which another group of banks will become the main actors in the backbone of the cross-correlations. © 2021, The Author(s).",Bank lending; Correlation-based filtered methods; Portfolio correlations; Principal component analysis; Random matrix theory; Systemic risk,,"Luu, D.T.; Institute of Economics, Germany; email: d.t.luu@economics.uni-kiel.de",,Springer,09277099,,,,English,Comput.

We construct speculative and hedging sentiment indices based on the weekly data of fund and commercial positions of four energy futures: crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) from 15 January 2013 to 5 February 2019. Our study demonstrates that speculative sentiment generates greater market fluctuations in the energy futures markets than hedging sentiment; and, further, speculative sentiment stimulates a reversal effect on the returns of crude oil futures. Moreover, speculative sentiment exerts positive systemic risk compensation on the four futures' returns, whereas hedging sentiment alleviates volatilities in the energy futures markets. Most notably, distinguishing it from the leverage effect in stock markets, the speculative sentiment in the energy futures markets is influenced more by good than by bad news; while hedging sentiment exhibits emotional neutrality, as opposed to its impact on stock markets as reported in the literature. Additionally, the positive hedging sentiment in crude oil futures demonstrates significant systemic risk compensation, whereas the three other futures do not have an influence, confirming the prevalence of speculation in hedging transactions in crude oil futures. Our further analysis shows cross-market volatility spillover effects, among which speculative sentiment inherent in crude oil futures causes volatility spillovers to the three other futures, while hedging sentiment has no such effect. Our study has implications for overseeing international energy futures markets, providing regulators with evidence that will facilitate the development of effective strategies to strengthen market supervision. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Cross-market spillover effects; Energy futures markets; Hedging sentiment; Market supervision; Speculative sentiment,,"Liu, J.; Business School, United Kingdom; email: jia.liu@port.ac.uk",,Elsevier Inc.,10575219,,,,English,Int.

Yet the utility of complex FMI comprising long custodial chains and large global Central Counterparties (CCPs) for the operation of modern markets is not seriously disputed. The change in the technology paradigm with the introduction of DLT systems for securities and derivatives FMI can increase investor control, the efficiency of risk management and, to some extent, augment the distribution of systemic risk. It can thus create a more diverse and resilient financial ecosystem. This cross-disciplinary paper identifies a multitude of reasons that favour a paradigm shift in FMI technology. It also sketches a comprehensive blockchain-based framework for the development of permission-based platforms for derivatives clearing and settlement and the handling of liquidity shortages within DLT systems. Arguably, the impact of technological change should lead to a reduction of industry rents for the benefit of end investors and of the end users of finance (entrepreneurs and businesses) enhancing market welfare.

Network theory is introduced as a main approach in the modeling and simulation of financial and economic systems. In this paper, a simulation model is introduced based on the ownership network to analyze the contagion and systemic risk events. For this purpose, different network structures with different values for parameters are considered to investigate the stability of the financial system in the presence of different kinds of idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. The considered network structures include Erdos–Renyi, core–periphery, segregated and power-law networks. Moreover, the results of the proposed model are also calculated for a real ownership network. The results show that the network structure has a significant effect on the probability and the extent of contagion in the financial systems. For each network structure, various values for the parameters results in remarkable differences in the systemic risk measures. The results of real case show that the proposed model is appropriate in the analysis of systemic risk and contagion in financial markets, identification of systemically important firms and estimation of market loss when the initial failures occur. This paper suggests a new direction in the modeling of contagion in the financial markets, in particular that the effects of new kinds of financial exposure are clarified.

This paper examines the impacts of the 2018 new asset management regulation on the credit spread of newly issued LGFV bonds and explores how the new asset management regulation affects the implicit guarantee of local governments in the LGFV market that has piled up systemic risks. We find that the release of the new asset management regulation has raised the credit spread of LGFV bonds at issuance. More importantly, the credit spread becomes increasingly sensitive to the local governments’ financial capacity and credibility right after the introduction of the new asset management regulation. Therefore, investors are compensated by more risk premiums for holding LGFV bonds issued by the local governments with a weaker balance sheet. Consequently, the implicit guarantee problem in the LGFV bond market has worsened. © 2022 Economic and Political Studies.",2018 new asset management regulation; credit risks; LGFV bonds; Local government debts,,"Jia, D.; HSBC Business School, China; email: dun.jia@pku.edu.cn",,Routledge,20954816,,,,English,Econ.

Semiconductor companies increase their intrinsic value through financing, industry mergers and acquisitions, and venture capital searches. At the same time, market investors pay more attention to the intrinsic value of companies when looking for good investment targets. Therefore, the systematic risk assessment of the global semiconductor market has become a common concern of market investors and corporate management. In this context, this paper found a method that can assess the systemic risk of the semiconductor global market, which is to use the K-means algorithm based on deep feature fusion. This paper analyzed the algorithm in depth, analyzed the quantum space of tensors, and used the definition of cluster fusion to obtain the relationship between the projection matrices U and V. Experiments were carried out on the improved algorithm, and market research was conducted on a multinational semiconductor company A, which mainly included the basic statistics of the rate of return and the ACF and PACF coefficients of the rate of return series. Finally, the stock risk comparison of company A and company B in the same period was carried out. The experimental results showed that comparing the three items of compound growth rate, coefficient of variation, and active rate coefficient, the highest compound growth rate was 0.41, which came from Category 2, the highest variation coefficient was 2.31, which came from Category 10, and the highest active rate coefficient was 1.78, which came from Category 9.

Using bilateral trade and portfolio investment data between China and OECD countries from 2003 to 2019, results show that first, independent of the source of contagion, the network system with a self-healing capability always reaches the steady state after a certain period of the risk transmission process. The investment network is more resilient to systemic risk than the trade network. Second, Random Immune is inferior in intervening on important countries and currently provides weaker protection for trade–investment​ networks than two other types of immunization strategies because of the high concentration of trade and investment events in the networks. Third, Target Immune aiming at controlling the most important country, the US, is not optimized for improving risk resistance of countries cooperating scarcely with the US, but its optimization efficiency continues to increase as the significance of the US in the system keeps rising. Fourth, among the four Neighbor Immune approaches, Asset-Neighbor Immune provides the superior and consistently enhanced protection for the trade–investment networks, and Liability-Neighbor Immune has the dominant position in terms of the enhancement for risk resistance of each country's trade and investment channels.

National authorities often establish their own methodology by adding modern tools that, in their opinion, adequately capture systemic risk in their domestic economy. The paper shows that the updated methodology for assessing systemically important Ukrainian banks can be verified on publicly available data. The analysis confirms that the updated version of the National Bank's assessment methodology is in line with those recommended by international banking institutions, but does not fully capture the current systemic risk factors. Systematization of literary and statistical sources indicates that one of the main sources of systemic risk in Ukraine is the establishment of a state monopoly in the banking market. Thus, the assessment methodology should be supplemented by instruments to evaluate the performance of the banking business. The indicator-based method and the minus one bank Z-score approach were tested to identify Ukrainian systemically important banks from 2010 to 2017. The loss of the leading role of PrivatBank in ensuring banking stability after the transition to state ownership since 2016, as well as the equalization of the systemic risk contribution of banks with state, foreign and domestic capital, was discovered. The study empirically confirms that Z-index, which combines the positive characteristics of the static asset return ratio and bankruptcy probability, can be used to determine the methodology as an indicator of the performance of systemically important banks, primarily state-owned banks. © Oleksandra Hirna, Dariusz Wawrzyniak, Lidiia Dudynets, Olha Vernei, Vira Druhova, 2020.",Bank performance; Banking supervision; Systemic risk measure; Transparency; Z-score,,"Druhova, V.; Faculty of Finance, Ukraine",,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,18167403,,,,English,Banks Bank Syst.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090221123,scopus

With regard to the first topic, I find strong arguments in the theory of financial intermediation that, in contradiction to the reasoning in the influential paper of Admati et al. (2010), bank equity is indeed costly and excessive capital requirements would hamper the efficiency of the banking system. Furthermore, I identify several incentive effects of today’s regulatory setting that lead to a more homogenous banking system with larger banks. This development could have negative effect on efficiency, in particular with regard to special needs of the German economy. And although the individual banks might be safer under the new regime, the evolving structure will probably contain a higher systemic risk. © 2020, Duncker and Humblot GmbH.

As a novel approach to measuring risk in networks, this paper proposes RiskRank as a general-purpose aggregation operator of risk in nodes and links. RiskRank relies on a system represented as a hierarchical network, where node values and linkages represent individual risk levels and interconnectedness, respectively. The measure is used to aggregate risk in the vein of a novel network centrality measure, allowing for the integration of the interrelations of different entities in the network with any other measure of node risk. The use of RiskRank is illustrated through a real-world case on systemic risk in Europe, in which we show that it improves performance in out-of-sample analysis. We provide an estimation of systemic risk from country-level risk indicators and combine it with cross-border linkages to illustrate the practical benefit of the proposed approach. From a policy perspective, our results strengthen the results of previous research and underline the importance of integrating a network perspective in macro-prudential analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Aggregation operators; Interconnected risk; Network analysis; Systemic risk,,"Sarlin, P.; Department of Economics, Finland; email: peter@risklab.fi",,Elsevier B.V.,02649993,,,,English,Econ.

Box 15018, Flagstaff, AZ  86011, United States","Historical analogies can help us contextualize new technical developments with social, cultural, and political forces at work. The late Joseon Dynasty period of Korea (1639–1910), a closed economy with detailed written records, provides a rare opportunity to examine a social-ecological system (SES) responding to drivers of change over a long period of time. Based on historical records and reconstructed data, we aim to: (1) characterize how the expansion of human technology, Ondol (traditional underfloor heating system), affected different subsystems and their interactions within the SES over time, (2) examine the role of the government in promoting the technology and regulating its impacts, and (3) summarize the pertinent lessons learned from old Korea for governing a modern-day bioeconomy. Ondol allows various forest biomass to be utilized as household fuel, including fuelwood, forest litter, and grass scraped from forest floor. Continuous biomass harvesting over 250 years to feed Ondol contributed to forest degradation and the forest ecosystem condition trapped in the early successional stage in the Korean Peninsula. The ecological changes were exacerbated by the Pine Policy with a singular focus on reserving Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora Siebold and Zucc.) for government uses. The policy failed to recognize basic needs of the public while countenancing an expansion of Ondol and a cultural preference for heated floors that propagated an increased use of biomass fuel. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing potential technology traps where a human innovation opened opportunities for more resource use. The lessons learned from old Korea show that bioeconomy transitions would require multifaceted governance responses while being cautious about being too closely tied to the dominant national agenda. Environmental history has much to offer for understanding the social and ecological systemic risks of the current technical developments. We call for more historical analogs from different parts of the world to “move forward by looking back”. © 2020 by the authors.

This has produced highly competitive and fragmented financial markets. It is in this market environment that the ultra-fast segment of high-frequency trading (HFT) has materialised. European regulators have addressed the potential adverse market impact of HFT in terms of increased systemic risk (e.g. 'flash crashes') and market abuse through provisions in MiFID II and in the MAR. But there is also an additional concern that so far has received less regulatory attention-the question of whether HFT is fair. This article explores whether and how HFT raises fairness-related concerns against the backdrop of the overarching policy goal of maintaining confidence in the financial markets. Finding that HFT does indeed raise such concerns, it then asks whether the newly instituted provisions on algorithmic trading and HFT in MiFID II and MAR do anything to alleviate this problem. The answer is to a certain extent yes. However, significant concerns remain unaddressed by the new regulatory context. The article suggests other provisions in MiFID II that in the author's view should be assessed with a view to target fairness-related concerns raised by HFT. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",Algorithmic trading; Conflict of interest; Fairness; High-frequency trading; Market confidence; Market integrity; Market microstructure; MiFID II; Systemic risk; Unfair market practices,,"Myklebust, T.; Faculty of Law, Norway",,Kluwer Law International,09596941,,,,English,Eur.

Methods: We compared the average and minimum GCIPL thickness in RVO eyes with fellow eyes and healthy controls including 40 unilateral RVO patients and 48 healthy subjects. The average GCIPL thickness in BRVO eyes was segmented into the affected and opposite area according to the site of lesion, comparing them with corresponding areas in fellow eyes. Furthermore, maximum central macular thickness (CMT), visual acuity (VA), and intravitreal injection times were recorded to investigate their relationship with the GCIPL thickness. Results: Despite no significant difference in CMT (P = 0.96), the average (P = 0.02 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) and minimum (both P &lt; 0.001) GCIPL thicknesses were decreased in RVO eyes with resolved macular edema after treatment in comparison to fellow eyes and healthy eyes. Maximum CMT thickness was negatively correlated with the minimum GCIPL thickness (r = − 0.47, P = 0.003). VA and average GCIPL thickness were associated (rs = − 0.49, P = 0.002). In a subgroup analysis that only included BRVO patients, the opposite area revealed no significant difference between two eyes (P = 0.91) although the affected area in BRVO eyes was decreased (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: A decrease of GCIPL thickness in RVO was observed even after anatomic restoration and associated with VA prognosis. These GCIPL defects could be attributable to systemic risks and RVO itself, not anti-VEGF effects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Macular edema; Optical coherence tomography; Retinal ganglion cells; Retinal vein occlusion; Systemic factors,"adult; Article; central macular thickness; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; female; follow up; human; macular edema; male; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; retina ganglion cell; retina vein occlusion; retinal inner plexiform layer; retrospective study; risk factor; visual acuity; complication; macular edema; pathology; procedures; prognosis; retina ganglion cell; retina vein occlusion; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Macular Edema; Prognosis; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Tomography, Optical Coherence","Zhang, L.; Department of Ophthalmology, No. 16 Jiangsu Road, Shandong Province, China; email: zhanglina1105@163.com",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,01655701,,INOPD,36411372.0,English,Int.

Wicked problems reflect our incomplete understanding of interdependent global systems and the systemic risk they pose; such problems escape solutions because they are often ill-defined, and thus mis-identified and under-appreciated by communities of problem-solvers. While there are well-documented benefits to tackling boundary-crossing problems from various viewpoints, the integration of diverse approaches can nevertheless contribute confusion around the collective understanding of the core concepts and feasible solutions. We explore this paradox by analyzing the development of both scholarly (social) and topical (cognitive) communities - two facets of knowledge production studies here that contribute towards the evolution of knowledge in and around a problem, termed a knowledge trajectory - associated with three wicked problems: deforestation, invasive species, and wildlife trade. We posit that saturation in the dynamics of social and cognitive diversity growth is an indicator of reduced uncertainty in the evolution of the comprehensive knowledge trajectory emerging around each wicked problem. Informed by comprehensive bibliometric data capturing both social and cognitive dimensions of each problem domain, we thereby develop a framework that assesses the stability of knowledge trajectory dynamics as an indicator of wickedness associated with conceptual and solution uncertainty. As such, our results identify wildlife trade as a wicked problem that may be difficult to address given recent instability in its knowledge trajectory. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",collaboration networks; diversity; knowledge integration; knowledge networks; Knowledge trajectory; relatedness,,"Arroyave, F.J.; Department of Management of Complex Systems, United States; email: farroyavebermudez@ucmerced.edu

Design/methodology/approach: This paper introduces a tractable guarantee network model that captures the invulnerability of the network in terms of cascade-based attack. Furthermore, the equilibrium points are introduced for banks to determine loan origination. Findings: The proposed approach not only develops equilibrium analysis as an extended perspective in the guarantee network, but also applies cascading failure method to construct the guarantee network. The equilibrium points are examined by simulating experiment. The invulnerability of the guarantee network is quantified by the survival of firms in the simulating progress. Research limitations/implications: There is less study in equilibrium analysis of the guarantee network. Additionally, cascading failure model is expressed in the presented approach. Moreover, agent-based model can be extended in generating the guarantee network in the future study. Originality/value: The approach of this paper presents a framework to analyze the equilibrium of the guarantee network. For this, the systemic risk of the whole guarantee network and each node's contribution are measured to predict the probability of default on cascading failure. Focusing on cascade failure process based on equilibrium point, the invulnerability of the guarantee network can be quantified. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cascading failure; Guarantee network; Invulnerability; Systemic risk,Computational methods; Risk assessment; Simulation platform; Cascading failure models; Cascading failures; Design/methodology/approach; Equilibrium analysis; Equilibrium point; Guarantee network; Invulnerability; Network models; Simulating experiments; Systemic risks; Autonomous agents,"Ren, C.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: cren1202@hotmail.com",,Emerald Publishing,0368492X,,,,English,Kybernetes,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151426079,scopus

A lot of papers have reported diverse local risk factors affecting the success and survival rate of dental implants, either for a short or a long period. However, there are also many types of systemic disorders or relatively administrated medicine that may jeopardize the security and success of dental implant treatment. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic also poses a challenge to dental implant clinicians. Some of these risk factors are clinically common but to some extent unfamiliar to dentists, thus optimal measurements are often lacking when they occur in dental clinics. In this review, we analyze potential systemic risk factors that may affect the success rate of dental implants. Some of them may affect bone mineral density or enhance the likelihood of local infection, thus impeding osseointegration. Others may even systemically increase the risk of the surgery and threaten patients’ life. In order to help novices receive high-risk patients who need to get dental implant treatment in a more reasonable way, we accordingly review recent research results and clinical experiments to discuss promising precautions, such as stopping drugs that impact bone mineral density or the operation, and addressing any perturbations on vital signs. ©2021 Society for Leukocyte Biology",dental implant; systemic disorder risk factors; systemic medication risk factors; systemic risk factors,angiogenesis inhibitor; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; catechol methyltransferase inhibitor; corticosteroid; digitalis; tricyclic antidepressant agent; bone density; bone disease; cardiovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; endocrine disease; gastrointestinal disease; hematologic disease; human; immunopathology; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; respiratory tract disease; Review; risk factor; systemic disease; urinary tract disease; vital sign; bone density; dental restoration; osseointegration; risk factor; tooth implant; Bone Density; Dental Implants; Dental Restoration Failure; Humans; Osseointegration; Risk Factors,"Man, Y.; State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, China; email: manyi780203@126.com

These studies revealed that the composite cycle is of paramount importance to issue a proper policy. The boom-and-bust of the cycle must be considered in order to achieve the macro prudential objective of curbing excessive credit growth and preventing the build-up of systemic risk. To that end, in the context of the dual banking system where Islamic and conventional banks operate side by side under similar financial circumstances, it is crucial to assess whether the Islamic financing cycle behaves as its conventional counterpart. Given the fact that most of the literature has focused on the cyclical behavior from a conventional perspective, this paper assesses the characteristics of both Islamic and conventional financing cycles. This analysis will help in framing adequate policy implementation of macro prudential policies for the dual banking system. Following the methodology employed by Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis (2012) in forming the common cycle, this paper concludes that Islamic banks functioning under the same environment as their conventional counterparts, appear to have a similar peak-and-trough cycle but different amplitude. This means that macro prudential policy, particularly countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) policy is deemed crucial to be adopted in Islamic banking as set out in the Islamic Financial Services Board document, IFSB-15 (IFSB, 2013). © 2020.

In this paper we show that HF surprises in the Euro Area after 2008 reflect the impact of three shocks, not two. Besides an unconventional monetary shock and the information shock, we consider a third shock, labeled ‘spread shock’, resulting from the ECB management of fragmentation risk in the sovereign bond market. The spread shock can be framed within a stylized model of multiple equilibria where a central bank in a monetary union attempts to offset self-fulling expectations of default in sovereign debts. We point-identify simultaneously the dynamic causal effects produced by the three monetary policy shocks by using a proxy-SVAR estimated on daily data. The external instruments are obtained from HF monetary surprises combining sign and narrative restrictions, and additional point restrictions are exploited for the identification in a second stage. Empirical results based on Italian (Spanish) spreads, reveal that the spread shock represents an important ingredient of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the Euro Area after the Global Financial Crisis. Identification-robust confidence intervals show that the impact of the spread shock on monthly variables like industrial production and measures of systemic risk and financial distress is non-negligible and aligns with the idea that the ECB stabilizes fragmentation risk. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",European central bank; Monetary policy shock; Proxy-SVAR; Spread shock,central bank; financial crisis; financial market; monetary policy; sovereignty; Italy,"Fanelli, L.; Department of Economics, Piazza Scaravilli 2, Italy; email: luca.fanelli@unibo.it",,Elsevier B.V.,00142921,,,,English,Eur.

There are three aspects to the contribution of this paper. First, shock propagation in a network is developed purely from fundamental principles of complex systems. Second, systemic risk is shown to arise naturally in such a complex system. If a shock is delivered either to one agent or to many agents simultaneously, that shock may be transmitted further, thereby resulting in systemic risk. Third, the monetary loss to the entire system as a result of systemic shock is quantified. Simulations are used to study two particular characteristics of the interactions. The first is the resistance or susceptibility of individual agents to a shock. The second is the time it takes for the shock to affect the entire system. The results show that if a shock is applied to all agents in a network, the systemic effect of that shock is transmitted very quickly. Applying a shock to very few agents results only in an idiosyncratic effect. If an agent can transmit the shock further, a systemic effect will result. The recovery period for agents affected by a systemic shock can be orders of magnitude greater than the time taken for the shock to take effect. The overall effect of the shock on the system is quantified by formulating a ‘contagion index’, which measures the ratio of the total capital lost due to the systemic effect to the total capital before the shock was delivered. The result (approximately 7%) is consistent with other studies, but is more widely applicable because it is not based on one empirical data set. © 2019, The Author(s).",Complex system; Complexity; Contagion; Contagion index; Mathematica; Recovery; Shock; Simulation; Systemic risk,Acoustic wave propagation; Computer system recovery; Large scale systems; Recovery; Complexity; Contagion; Contagion index; Mathematica; Shock; Simulation; Systemic risks; Complex networks,"Mitic, P.; Department of Computer Science, Gower Street, United Kingdom; email: p.mitic@ucl.ac.uk",,Springer,14327643,,,,English,Soft Comput.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075349985,scopus

We adopt the dynamic framework provided by panel Vector Autoregressive Models which allows for endogeneity issues and this is a novelty of our approach. The main findings are that structural models seem to be more relevant during high volatile periods and that the relation between the CDS and its theoretical determinants is not constant over time.

Findings: The authors mainly find that client importance is negatively related with future bank-specific crash risk and distress risk, and also with sector-wide systemic crash risk and systemic distress risk in the future. The authors also report some evidence that these relations become more pronounced during the crisis period than during the non-crisis period. Moreover, the effect of client importance on systemic risk is found to strengthen in banks audited by Big-N auditors, by auditors without clients who restate earnings, and by auditors with more industry expertise. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the auditing and systemic risk literature. Practical implications: This study has implications for regulating the banking industry.

Globally we are seeing the effects of such attacks not only on the financial domain but also in healthcare, government and critical infrastructure (Masys in Networks and network analysis for defence and security. Springer Publishing, 2014, [19]; Masys in Sensemaking in security. Springer Publishing, 2021a, [24]). Understanding the extent of the impact of cyber incursions and attacks requires understanding the systemic cyber risks '... of risks spreading across interdependent systems' (Welburn et al., in Risk Analysis: An International Journal, 2021, [39]). The World Economic Forum (2016) [36] defines Systemic cyber risk as '... the risk that a cyber event (attack(s) or other adverse event(s) at an individual component of a critical infrastructure ecosystem will cause significant delay, denial, breakdown, disruption or loss, such that services are impacted not only in the originating component but consequences also cascade into related (logically and/or geographically) ecosystem components, resulting in significant adverse effects to public health or safety, economic security or national security'. Lucas et al. (Advanced Theory and Simulations, vol 1, 2018, [15]) argues that '... systemic risk refers to a potential collapse of a system of potentially global importance and criticality to services that humans urgently need. This dimension of a large potential threat within a complex web of interacting elements distinguishes systemic from other types of risk'. As such traditional risk management approaches are not sufficient for dealing with them IRGC (Guidelines for the governance of systemic risks. International Risk Governance Center, Lausanne, p 5, 2018, [9]). This chapter explores systemic risk across the cyber landscape through the non-traditional security lens (Masys in Handbook of security science.

For this purpose, Pubmed and Scopus databases were queried using the terms “knee osteoarthritis”, “risk factors” and “improvement”. Six main categories of modifiable risk factors were identified: (1) obesity and overweight, (2) comorbidity, (3) occupational factors, (4) physical activity, (5) biomechanical factors, (6) dietary exposures. In the era of age- and obesity-related diseases, the combined effects of local and systemic risk factors should be managed by combined measures. Femoral muscle-strengthening physical activities, complemented with proper diet, weight loss, vocational rehabilitation, management of comorbidities (especially diabetes and depression), and biomechanical support may add up to the holistic therapeutic approach towards the patient with KOA. An individual risk factor modification program should be developed in accordance with patient preferences and habits, workplace, medical history, and overall health condition.

But these same regulatory changes also incentivized a continuing migration of traditional banking activities to nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), where looser regulation allowed for dangerous buildups of systemic risk. These risks were then realized across many NBFIs and markets in 2020. While legislation to harmonize regulation across these different domains would be desirable, we do not believe it likely in the foreseeable future. In this paper we propose a congruence principle for financial regulation, whereby regulators use existing statutory authority to coordinate rules across economically similar instruments.

Firstly, it selected the daily rate of return of listed 14 commercial banks in China. Then, the data is divided into three stages according to major financial events ""money shortage"" and ""stock disaster"". Secondly, it used the complex network method to construct the shock network and the volatility overflow network based on the BEKK-GARCH model, and it explored the wave spillover effect and linkage effect of the bank's wave network by analyzing the network's indicators. Finally, it selected the volatility overflow network as an example, and used the target network and the random immune strategy to do a robustness test. The research result shows that: 1) at different stages, bank volatility spillover networks have different network structures, and the impact of risks can make banks more closely; 2)when the risk spillover network in a high-risk zone system, the network agglomeration coefficient is increasing, and the average path of the network is shortening significantly, this feature indicates that banks in the spillover network will be closely linked to resist risks; 3)the impact of target immunity on network stability is much greater than that of random immunity. © 2020, The Journal of Agency of Complex Systems and Complexity Science.

For defenders, it is critical to enumerate and identify all digital relays to determine the systemic risks. Any combination of disruptive switching via the compromised relays can result in misoperation or immediate effect to the system. The resulting consequence of these attack's initial events would possibly incur cascading failure to a grid. This paper quantifies the criticality of substation protective relays with the combination of the outage level and its corresponding severity risk index. The proposed hypothesized outages are based on the type of protective relaying, bus configuration of a substation, and commonly implemented relaying schemes, such as bus differential, directional overcurrent and distance relays, are studied. This preliminary work also provides three approaches of determination in probabilities for sensitivity analysis.

Still, little is known about nonocular risk factors. We use an umbrella review to examine the meta-analytic evidence of the correlation between nonocular factors and glaucoma. Method: We searched PubMed and Embase databases up to July 24, 2020. Eligible meta-analyses (MAs) included cohort, case-control, and randomized controlled study designs. Two authors independently extracted the data and evaluated the methodological quality of the MAs. AMSTAR 2 was used to assess the methodological quality of each included MA. Results: This umbrella review contains 22 MAs with 22 unique nonocular factors in total. We identified 11 factors that increase the risk of glaucoma: hyperlipidemia, nocturnal dip in blood pressure, infection with Helicobacter pylori, myopia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, corneal properties, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, migraine, and plasma homocysteine. We identified 3 factors that reduce the risk of glaucoma: dietary intake of vitamin A, dietary intake of vitamin C, and short-term statin use. We identified 8 factors that had no association with glaucoma: dietary intake of vitamin B, dietary intake of vitamin E, cigarette smoking, Alzheimer's disease, serum folic acid, serum vitamin B6, serum vitamin B12, and serum vitamin D. Conclusions: In this umbrella review of MAs, evidence was found for associations of various nonocular factors with glaucoma to different degrees. However, risk factors were only mildly associated, suggesting low impact of systemic risk factors. Additional higher quality studies are needed to provide robust evidence. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by S.

Total arsenic, cadmium and lead concentrations in fresh and processed tuna (110 samples) marketed in Galicia (NW Spain) were determined by ICP-MS spectrometry. The average concentrations of As and Cd, 3.78 and 0.024 mg kg−1 w.w., respectively, in fresh tuna were statistically significantly higher than those in processed tuna (p &lt; 0.001). The contents in processed tuna were 0.295–7.85 mg kg−1 for As and ND-0.045 mg kg−1 for Cd. The Pb content was negligible in both types of tuna. In canned tuna, decreasing As and Cd concentrations were observed in different preparation-packaging media: olive oil &gt; natural &gt; pickled sauce. Of the two species studied in canned tuna, Thunnus alalunga showed statistically significant higher levels both for As 1.28 mg kg−1 (p &lt; 0.001) and Pb 0.013 mg kg−1 (p = 0.0496) than Thunnus albacares. No samples surpassed the limits set by the EU for Cd and Pb. The limit for As in fish has not been established, but the arsenic contents in fresh tuna reported here are important, as they are among the highest reported in the literature. Considering public health in children and adults with respect to the investigated metals, the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) did not exceed the tolerable intakes. No chronic systemic risk was found since all the target hazard quotients (THQs-TTHQs) were far below 1 (critical value), and the carcinogenic risk (CR) for As did not exceed the acceptable value of 10−5. Thus, tuna consumption in the Galician diet does not pose a risk for different population groups in terms of these studied metals/metalloids. © 2018",Arsenic; Cadmium; Lead; Risk assessment; Tuna,"Arsenic; Biochemistry; Cadmium; Commerce; Fish; Lead; Olive oil; Average concentration; Cadmium and leads; Carcinogenic risk; Estimated daily intakes; Metal bioaccumulation; Ms spectrometries; Target hazard quotients; Tuna; Risk assessment; arsenic; cadmium; lead; olive oil; arsenic; cadmium; heavy metal; lead; mercury; arsenic; cadmium; concentration (composition); dietary intake; health risk; lead; perciform; public health; risk assessment; Article; cancer risk; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dietary exposure; dietary intake; estimated daily intake; fish meat; food analysis; fresh tuna; Galicia (Spain); health hazard; nonhuman; parameters; population risk; priority journal; processed tuna; risk assessment; target hazard quotient; Thunnus alalunga; Thunnus albacares; tuna; analysis; animal; dietary exposure; food contamination; human; metabolism; sea food; Spain; statistics and numerical data; tuna; water pollutant; Galicia [Spain]; Spain; Scombridae; Thunnus alalunga; Thunnus albacares; Animals; Arsenic; Cadmium; Dietary Exposure; Food Contamination; Humans; Lead; Mercury; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Seafood; Spain; Tuna; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Melgar, M.J.; Department of Toxicology, Spain; email: mj.melgar@usc.es",,Elsevier B.V.,00489697,,STEVA,29426155.0,English,Sci.

The local maximums of the risk indicators are found to have the ability to predict the trends of oil prices. In our sample periods, the indicator based on the network density sends five signals and the indicator based on the modularity index sends four signals. The four signals sent by both indicators are able to warn the drop of future oil prices and the signal only sent by the network density is followed by a huge rise of oil prices.

Most researches focus on the effect of system connectivity on systemic risk and demonstrate that connectivity provides both risk-spread channel and risk-sharing mechanism. But the management of systemic risk is quite different in real-time gross settlement system and net settlement system. We provide an integrated analysis of the effect of connectivity and netting on systemic risk in payment systems by considering more detailed network structures of pure creditors and pure debtors. We show that the effect of netting is partly due to the change of network connectivity, which severs the contagion channel of shocks. Moreover, netting can lower the actual magnitude of the shock from the beginning by reducing source bank's debt. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",Netting; network connectivity; simulation; systemic risk,Risk management; Economic development; Integrated analysis; Netting; Network connectivity; Network structures; simulation; System connectivity; Systemic risks; Risk assessment,"Chen, S.; Business School, China; email: szchen@csu.edu.cn",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,19328184,,,,English,IEEE Syst.

In applications the focus of interest is on capturing joint tail behavior rather than a variation around the mean. Quantile and expectile regression are used here as tools of data analysis. When it comes to characterizing tail event curves one faces a dimensionality problem, which is important for CoVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) determination. A projection-based single-index model specification may come to the rescue but for ultrahigh-dimensional regressors one faces yet another dimensionality problem and needs to balance precision versus dimension. Such a balance is achieved by combining semiparametric ideas with variable selection techniques. In particular, we propose a projection-based single-index model specification for very high-dimensional regressors. This model is used for practical CoVaR estimates with a systemically chosen indicator. In simulations we demonstrate the practical side of the semiparametric CoVaR method. The application to the U.S. financial sector shows good backtesting results and indicate market coagulation before the crisis period.

This research contribution is about applying a novel systemic risk index to the Romanian financial system (FRM@RO), to identify potential sources of systemic risk, and to understand network interconnections, thus increasing risk awareness of both managers and regulators. By using data for companies listed at the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE), our article highlights several aspects of the systemic risk of the Romanian stock market. First, our study reveals that the main driver of systemic risk, especially during financial crises, is the volatility index, VIX. However, local factors, such as ROBOR interest rate and sectorial indices for financial investment companies, in general, and energy sector companies, in particular, are extremely important in triggering systemic risk. Second, the system risk indicator for the Romanian stock market, FRM@RO, may capture both investor sentiment, measured via the Google Trends Search Volume Index, and stock market volatility. Third, FRM@RO can act as an early warning indicator for economic turmoil, being able to predict periods of technical recession one quarter in advance. Fourth, by using network analysis, we can identify, daily, the level of market interconnectedness and highlight the main companies triggering tail co-movements. Fifth, we emphasize the need for an integrated early warning system for financial crises. © 2023, Institute for Economic Forecasting.

We analyze a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which liquidity and capital regulations interact with the supply of risk-free assets. In the model, the endogenously time varying tightness of liquidity and capital constraints generates intermediaries’ leverage cycle, influencing the pricing of risk and the level of risk in the economy. Our analysis focuses on liquidity policies’ implications for households’ welfare. Within the context of our model, liquidity requirements are preferable to capital requirements, as tightening liquidity requirements lowers the likelihood of systemic distress without impairing consumption growth.

The minimization of the systemic risk via a close and detailed monitoring of the entire banking network became a priority. This is a complex and demanding task considering the size of the banking systems; in the US and the EU they include more than 10,000 institutions. In this paper, we introduce a methodology which identifies a subset of banks that can: (a) efficiently represent the behavior of the whole banking system, and (b), provide, in the case of a failure, a plausible range of the crisis dispersion. The proposed methodology can be used by the regulators as an auxiliary monitoring tool to identify groups of banks that are potentially in distress and try to swiftly remedy their problems and minimize the propagation of the crisis by restricting contagion. This methodology is based on graph theory, and more specifically, complex networks. We termed this setting a “multivariate Threshold–Minimum Dominating Set” (mT-MDS), and it is an extension of the Threshold–Minimum Dominating Set methodology. The method was tested on a dataset of 570 U.S. banks, including 429 solvent ones and 141 failed ones. The variables used to create the networks were as follows: the total interest expense; the total interest income; the tier 1 (core) risk-based capital; and the total assets. The empirical results reveal that the proposed methodology can be successfully employed as an auxiliary tool for the efficient supervision of a large banking network. © 2022 by the authors.

Very often, this happens via interlinked critical infrastructures. Preparing these for natural hazards and carrying out risk assessments that consider their cascading effects on human livelihoods and well-being is a challenging task. Crisis management institutions can benefit from forecasts based on the idea of systemic risk. This study is based on stakeholder workshops, in which a systemic dynamic modelling method called the Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) was used to support contingency planning to identify the critical infrastructure-related factors, the vital functions in society, and to understand their interrelated nature. Together with the workshop participants (authorities and other service providers of critical infrastructures) we tested whether the CLD tool could help identify three types of indicators (threat factors, vulnerability, and resilience) that can help in assessing the risk level when a natural disaster hits. Our case study was a snowstorm, still a frequent phenomenon in the Nordic countries. This article describes and explains the possibilities and limitations of systemic dynamic modelling in contingency planning. Indicators describing the safety and security risks posed by natural hazards, as well as potential sources of data for these indicators, were identified. Identifying indicators that are relevant for anticipating interrelated and cascading effects offers valuable tools for risk assessment and security planning at operational and strategical levels. © 2022 by the authors.",causal loop diagram; critical infrastructure; indicators; resilience; vulnerability,,"Molarius, R.; VTT Technical Research Centre of FinlandFinland; email: riittamolarius@outlook.com",,MDPI,2313576X,,,,English,Safety,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138704027,scopus

While a significant attention has been given to aggregate risk assessment and risk propagation once the above two properties are given, less is known about how the risk is distributed in the network and its relations with its topology. We study this problem by investigating a large proprietary dataset of payments among 2.4M Italian firms, whose credit risk rating is known. We document significant correlations between local topological properties of a node (firm) and its risk. Moreover we show the existence of an homophily of risk, i.e. the tendency of firms with similar risk profile to be statistically more connected among themselves. This effect is observed when considering both pairs of firms and communities or hierarchies identified in the network. We leverage this knowledge to show the predictability of the missing rating of a firm using only the network properties of the associated node. © 2019, The Author(s).",Corporate networks; Credit rating; Credit risk; Financial networks; Machine learning,Aggregates; Knowledge management; Large dataset; Learning systems; Risk analysis; Topology; Corporate networks; Credit ratings; Credit risk rating; Credit risks; Emergent phenomenon; Financial networks; Network properties; Topological properties; Risk assessment,"Letizia, E.; Scuola Normale SuperioreItaly; email: elisa.letizia@sns.it",,SpringerOpen,21931127,,,,English,EPJ Data Sci.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066396729,scopus

Our principal innovation lies in our use of the social network analysis method to portray the spatial correlation characteristics of real-estate financial risk dynamically. We find that (1) the spatial correlation effect of real-estate financial risks in China is increasing and exhibits multiple superposition characteristics and spatial spillover effects; (2) current trends in real-estate financial risk suggest that the eastern region has a strong contagion potential, that the middle region is highly vulnerable, and that the level of risk in the northwest is high; (3) the spatial network of real-estate financial risks in China can be divided into four functional blocks, namely a strong net-spillover block, a weak net-spillover block, a broker block, and a main damaged block. There is significant gradient transmission between them. The network structure of real-estate financial risks poses serious challenges to the formulation and implementation of regulatory policies. However, it creates favorable conditions for the construction of cross-regional risk prevention mechanisms as well as a practical basis for preventing systemic risks in the new era. (4) Meanwhile, the formation of a spillover network of real-estate financial risks is driven by the high dependence of local fiscal resources on land finance, not by local GDP growth. © 2022 by the authors.
