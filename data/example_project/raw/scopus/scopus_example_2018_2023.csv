"Tomlinson, M.F.; Greenwood, D.; Mucha-Kruczyński, M.",2T-POT hawkes model for left and right-tail conditional quantile forecasts of financial log returns: out-of-sample comparison of conditional EVT models,"Conditional extreme value theory (EVT) methods promise enhanced forecasting of the extreme tail events that often dominate systemic risk. We present an improved two-tailed peaks-over-threshold (2T-POT) Hawkes model that is adapted for conditional quantile forecasting in both the left and right tails of a univariate time series. This is applied to the daily log returns of six large-cap indices. We also take the unique step of fitting the model at multiple exceedance thresholds (from the 1.25% to 25.00% mirrored quantiles). Quantitatively similar asymmetries in Hawkes parameters are found across all six indices, adding further empirical support to a temporal leverage effect in financial price time series in which the impact of losses is not only larger but also more immediate. Out-of-sample backtests find that our 2T-POT Hawkes model is more reliably accurate than the GARCH-EVT model when forecasting (mirrored) value at risk and expected shortfall at the 5% coverage level and below. This suggests that asymmetric Hawkes-type arrival dynamics are a better approximation of the true generating process for extreme daily log returns than GARCH-type conditional volatility. Our 2T-POT Hawkes model therefore presents a better-performing alternative for financial risk modelling. 2023 The Author(s)",2023,2023-01-01,0,International Journal of Forecasting,conditional extreme value theory; expected shortfall; garch-evt; hawkes processes; leverage effect; value at risk,"Tomlinson, M.F.

"Mao, J.; Shen, G.; Yan, J.",A continuous-time macro-finance model with knightian uncertainty,"This study presents a continuous-time macro-finance model with Knightian uncertainty to solve the full equilibrium dynamics of the economy and examine the impacts of Knightian uncertainty on systemic risk, which we find to be asymmetric and dependent on the state of the economy. We summarize this phenomenon as the Knightian uncertainty paradox: uncertainty increases systemic risk by reducing market liquidity in the normal regime, but mitigates it by lowering leverage in the crisis regime. Thereafter, we confirm the existence of this paradox using data from China. Additionally, the impacts of macro-prudential policies are evaluated. We confirm that these policies effectively mitigate systemic risk and postpone the Minsky moment however, they are detrimental to social welfare and retard economic recovery. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,1,Pacific Basin Finance Journal,continuous-time macro-finance model; full equilibrium dynamics; knightian uncertainty; minsky moment; systemic risk,"Mao, J.

"Du, X.; Ren, Y.",A study on the systematic importance of major banks in china,"In recent years, the outbreak of the global financial crisis has made people aware of the threat of the existence of systemic risk to the financial system. In the financial system, there are some banking-type financial institutions that have a pivotal position due to their large scale and other reasons and have a greater influence on systemic financial risks, so the identification and supervision of such financial institutions are very important. In China, banks occupy an important position among various financial institutions, and the main content of this paper is to identify the systemically important banks in China. In the research process, we refer to international disclosures and previous studies to determine the assessment models for different types of banks, then substitute the data of selected institutions to derive their systemic importance scores, select the threshold values to identify systemically important banks, explain the assessmentand finally propose policy recommendations based on the assessment2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2023,2023-01-01,0,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",entropy method; entropy methods; financial institution; financial risks; financial system; global financial crisis; indicator method; indicator methods; large-scales; research process; systemic risks; systemically important bank; systemically important banks,"Du, X.

"Ding, J.; Zhang, Y.; Feng, H.; Sun, H.","Actinomycotic primary canaliculitis: predisposing factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes","Ocular actinomycosis is an uncommon progressive infection. The study aims to investigate the predisposing factors, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of culture-proven cases of Actinomycotic primary canaliculitis. Methods: Single-center, retrospective, interventional case series. Culture-proven cases of Actinomyces-associated primary canaliculitis diagnosed and treated between January 2017 and December 2021 at the Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Capital Medical University were identified and reviewed for ocular and systemic risk factors, clinical presentations, microbiological profile, treatment modalities and outcomes.Of the 201 patients diagnosed with primary canaliculitis, 22 (10.9%) were caused by Actinomyces. The mean age at onset of 22 patients (21 women and one men) was 54 years. The lower canaliculus was most commonly involved (54.6%). The most frequent symptom was mattering without epiphora (77.3%) and clinical signs were punctal regurgitation of purulent discharge (100%) and expressible concretions (95.5%). Dry eye co-existed in 77.3% of patients, whereas no obvious systemic factors were found. Among 19 cases (86.0%) of identified Actinomyces species, A. odontolyticus (43.5%) was the predominant causative microorganism. There were 50% of patients with polymicrobial infection and the most common additional bacteria isolated were Streptococcus species. Conservative therapy combining repeated canalicular expression and irrigation with susceptible topical antibiotics achieved complete resolution in 86.4% of patients.Dry eye was identified in the vast majority of patients with Actinomycotic canaliculitis. Most cases are odontogenic in origin and the infection occurs in immunocompetent individuals. The conservative method combining canalicular expression and irrigation with topical susceptible antibiotics is recommendable as initial therapy.

"Gupta, I.; Adin, S.N.; Aqil, M.; Mujeeb, M.; Akhtar, M.",Application of qbd-based approach to the development and validation of an RP-HPLC method for simultaneous estimation of pregabalin and naringin in dual-drug loaded liposomes,"The current work delineates the development of a novel, rugged and sensitive stability-indicating risk-based HPLC method based on an analytical quality-by-design (QbD) approach for the concurrent estimation of naringin and pregabalin in dual-drug-loaded nanopharmaceuticals. Preliminary screening trials were conducted, along with systemic risk analysis, in order to identify the critical method attributes, namely injection volume, pH and acetonitrile content, that influence critical quality attributes. The Box Behnken design was used to optimize the tailing factor as a response to pregabalin and naringin in a short run time. The chromatographic conditions were improved by running 17 experimental runs generated by design expert software. After analysing the optimized zone within the confines of the design space, the following chromatographic conditions were chosen: mobile phase water acetonitrile adjusted to pH 6.9 with phosphate buffer (80:20, %v v), at flow rate of 1.0 ml min using a C18 analytical column at an isobestic wavelength of 212 nm. Furthermore, the optimized method was validated in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and was found to be within the prescribed limits. The developed RP-HPLC method has a high degree of practical utility in in vivo and in vitro studies for the synchronous detection of pregabalin and naringin in pharmaceutical nanodosage forms such as protein-based nanoparticles, nanocrystals, polymeric nanoparticles and metallic nanoparticles. 2023 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Biomedical Chromatography,'current; acetonitrile; chromatographic conditions; drug delivery; flavonoids; hplc; liposomes; nanoparticles; naringin; pregabalin; qbd; quality by designs; risk analysis; risk assessment; risk perception; risk-based; rp-hplc method; simultaneous estimation; stability-indicating,"Gupta, I.

"Maslak, G.D.; Senel, G.",Bank consolidation and systemic risk:a during the 2008 financial crisis,"In this paper, we analyze the relationship between US bank consolidation and systemic risk before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis. We find that mergers during the crisis decreased market-adjusted systemic risk. This effect was more pronounced for mergers with smaller acquirers of larger targets. Meanwhile, mergers of larger banks increased the aggregate systemic risk. In the years following the crisis, we find that banks that merged during the crisis had lower return volatility and fewer nonperforming loans than non-merged banks. Comparing pre-and post-crisis mergers, we do not find a significant difference with respect to their effect on systemic risk. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Journal of Financial Services Research,banks; financial crises; m&a; systemic risk,"Maslak, G.D.

"Matthan, T.",Beyond bad weather: climates of uncertainty in rural india,"Drawing on research in central India, this paper argues that emerging climatic risks are inseparable from the systemic risks of capitalist production, particularly in relation to India's ongoing agrarian crisis. Drawing from classic debates in peasant studies around agrarian risk, subsistence, and moral economy,argue that the intertwined effects of climatic variability and agrarian capitalism have produced a generalized climate of uncertainty’ in rural India.

"Martin, d.C.F.; Singh, S.J.; Fishman, T.; Thomas, A.; Noll, D.; Drescher, M.",Can a small island nation build resilience the significance of resource-use patterns and socio-metabolic risks in the bahamas,"Resource-use patterns may entail systemic risks and cascade effects, which consequently inhibit the ability to deliver socioeconomic services. Identifying resource-use patterns exhibiting systemic risks and reshaping their combinations is a potential lever in realizing the transition to a sustainable, resilient, and resource-secure system. Using an island context to assess the quantity and composition of resource throughput enables a more comprehensive analysis of these risks. This article presents the first mass-balance account of socio-metabolic flows for The Bahamas in 2018, to identify socio-metabolic risks and cascading effects. Socio-metabolic risks are systemic risks related to critical resource availability, material circulation integrity, and (in)equities in cost and benefit distributions. We utilize the economy-wide material flow accounting framework to map the material flow patterns across the economy. In 2018, annual direct material input was estimated at 9.4cap yr, of which 60% were imports. High masses of waste (1.4cap yr) remained unrecovered due to the lack of recycling. Total domestic extraction (DE) were dominated by non-metallic minerals with more than 80%, while marine biomass makes up barely 1% of total DE. Due to its linear, undiversified metabolism, and heavy imports dependency, the system is susceptible to socio-metabolic risks and cascading effects including low levels of self-sufficiency, high vulnerability to shocks, commodity price fluctuations, threats to sensitive ecosystems, health impacts, and economic losses, among others. A holistic resource management strategy and nature-based solutions that consider the trade-offs and synergies between different resource-use patterns are critical when exploring potential plans for metabolic risk reduction. 2023 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology.",2023,2023-01-01,1,Journal of Industrial Ecology,bahamas; circular economy; cost benefit analysis; ecology; economic and social effects; health risks; industrial ecology; industrial research; island industrial ecology; island sustainability; losses; material flow analysis; materials flow analysis; metabolism; resource allocation; resource use; risk assessment; socio-metabolic research; socio-metabolic risk; systemic risks,"Martin del Campo, F.

It examines the extent to which growing activities in this stock market generate systemic risk. We find strong linkages across all economic sectors of listed firms, with the financial and industrial sectors being the center of the system around which the other sectors revolve. Financial institutions are not the only source of systemic risk in the WAEMU region, even though they play an important role in the system. Finally, using panel regressions, we find that big, high-growth and profitable firms contribute more to systemic risk than others.

METHODS: Altogether, 211,173 participants aged 40 years from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were included in this study. The participants were divided into groups based on the number (1 orrelatives) and age of onset (no DM and early, common, or late onset) of familial DM. Participants' risk of DM was assessed using a Cox regression model with hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A logistic regression model with odds ratios was used to evaluate associations among the participants' likelihood of acquiring cardiometabolic diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease.The risk of developing DM was 2.02-fold (95% CI, 1.88 to 2.18) and 2.88-fold (95% CI, 2.50 to 3.33) higher, respectively, in participants withandfamily members diagnosed with familial DM. It was 2.72-fold (95% CI, 2.03 to 3.66) higher in those with early-onset familial DM.

"Igan, D.; Mirzaei, A.; Moore, T.",Does macroprudential policy alleviate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the resilience of banks,"This paper examines the resilience of banks as perceived by market participants during the COVID-19 crisis. We analyse how bank stock returns during January March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default. 2022 The Author(s)",2023,2023-01-01,4,Journal of Banking and Finance,bank resilience; bank stock returns; covid-19; macroprudential policy,"Igan, D.

Experts have established that this level of non-renewable resource use is unsustainable, ecologically unsafe, and critically changing climate patterns. Whereas climate change and biodiversity loss have subjected mankind to significant systemic risks, policymakers have recommended a switch from fossil fuel-based to a biobased economy and reconnecting humans with the biosphere as a way to mitigate these risks. A circular bioeconomy has been suggested as an efficient approach to utilize environmentally safe ecosystem services for socio-ecological development and transformation towards sustainability. The circular bioeconomy provides significant opportunities to achieve 17 SDGs and 134 targets of the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, and address numerous national and international challenges caused by climate action. In this review, we have highlighted links between circular bioeconomy and internationally agreed SDG targets particularly SDG 13 (climate action) and assessed ecosystem services in a circular biobased economy.

"Browning, T.; Kumar, M.; Sanders, N.; Sodhi, M.S.; Thürer, M.; Tortorella, G.L.","From supply chain risk to system-wide disruptions: research opportunities in forecasting, risk management and product design","Purpose: Supply chains must rebuild for resilience to respond to challenges posed by systemwide disruptions. Unlike past disruptions that were narrow in impact and short-term in duration, the Covid pandemic presented a systemic disruption and revealed shortcomings in responses. This study outlines an approach to rebuilding supply chains for resilience, integrating innovation in areas critical to supply chain management. Design methodology approach: The study is based on extensive debates among the authors and their peers. The authors focus on three areas deemed fundamental to supply chain resilience: (1) forecasting, the starting point of supply chain planning, (2) the practices of supply chain risk management and (3) product design, the starting point of supply chain design. The authors’ debated and pooled their viewpoints to outline key changes to these areas in response to systemwide disruptions, supported by a narrative literature review of the evolving research, to identify research opportunities. Findings: All three areas have evolved in response to the changed perspective on supply chain risk instigated by the pandemic and resulting in systemwide disruptions. Forecasting, or prediction generally, is evolving from statistical and time-series methods to human-augmented forecasting supplemented with visual analytics. Risk management has transitioned from enterprise to supply chain risk management to tackling systemic risk. Finally, product design principles have evolved from design-for-manufacturability to design-for-adaptability. All three approaches must work together.

The of the least square method (OLS) and the dynamic panel System Generalized Method of Moments (S-GMM) show that central bank transparency has a non-linear effect on systemic risk in both developed and developing countries. The difference is that central bank transparency has a positive U-shape impact on systemic risk in developed countries and an inverted U-shape impact on systemic risk in developing countries.

Previous studies that examined this relationship present mixed namely that cross-border diversification improves bank performance but also increases bank risks that could lead to systemic failure. Even so, this line of debate has not been examined in the case of Japanese banks conducting international operations. The present study questions whether cross-border diversification improves the performance of Japanese banks and to what extent each cross-border expansion activity affects bank performance. The latter was largely ignored in previous studies. Our show that cross-border diversification improves cost efficiency but decreases harms the profit efficiency of the banks analyzed. In addition, we find that the expansion of foreign assets and foreign branch operations present funding risks and operational inefficiency. We offer two important recommendations. First, as a major player in international lending, the current expansion activities of Japanese banks require close monitoring and supervision to prevent systemic risk resulting from aggressive and risky overseas expansion activities. Second, the current expansion strategies of Japanese banks, especially the expansion of overseas assets and branch operations (retail banking), should be re-examined. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Japan and the World Economy,bank performance; international expansion; overseas investment; systemic risk,"Aduba, J.

"Škrinjarić, T.",Introducing a composite indicator of cyclical systemic risk in croatia: possibilities and limitations,"This research deals with several approaches to constructing a composite indicator of cyclical systemic risk accumulation with a specific focus on Croatia. Such indicators are important in macroprudential policymaking, in order to track the position of the economy in the financial cycle. Moreover, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) depends on the timely and accurate estimation of cyclical risk accumulation. The credit gap as defined in the BCBS (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) and the ESRB (European Systemic Risk Board) guidance and recommendation has shown many flaws in practice. Thus, there is a need for improvement of the methodology. That is why this paper deals with the advantages and shortfalls of existing composite indicators of cyclical systemic risks and the possibilities of introducing them in Croatia.

"Meng, S.; Chen, Y.","Market volatility spillover, network diffusion, and financial systemic risk management: financial modeling and empirical study","With the accelerated pace of financial globalization and the gradual increase in linkages among financial markets, correctly identifying and describing the risk spillover and network diffusion in the financial system is extremely important for the prevention and management of systemic risk. Based on this, this paper takes the equity markets of 17 countries around the world from 2007 to 2022 as the research object, measures the volatility spillover effect of global financial markets using R-Vine Copula and the DY spillover index, constructs the volatility spillover network of global financial markets, discovers the spillover and diffusion pattern of global financial market risks, and provides relevant suggestions for systemic risk management. It is found that (1) there are certain aggregation characteristics in the network diffusion of global financial market volatility spillover (2) developed European countries such as the Netherlands, France, the UK, and Germany are at the center of the network and have a strong influence (3) Asian countries such as China, Japan, and India are at the periphery of the network and (4) shocks from crisis events enhance the global financial market volatility spillover effect. Based on the above findings, effective prevention of global financial market risk volatility spillover and network diffusion and reduction in systemic risk need to be carried out in two ways. First, by focusing on the financial markets of key countries in the network, such as the Netherlands, the UK, France, and Germany. The second approach is to mitigate the uneven development in global financial markets and reduce the high correlation among them. 2023 by the authors.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Mathematics,global financial markets; network diffusion; systemic risk management; volatility spillovers,"Meng, S.

"Fabian, C.; Cui, K.; Koeppl, H.",Mean field games on weighted and directed graphs via colored digraphons,"Multi-agent systems are in general hard to model and control due to their complex nature involving many individuals. Numerous approaches focus on empirical and algorithmic aspects of approximating outcomes and behavior in multi-agent systems and lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) on the other hand provide a mathematically well-founded and numerically scalable framework for a large number of connected agents. In standard GMFGs, the connections between agents are undirected, unweighted and invariant over time. Our paper introduces colored digraphon mean field games (CDMFGs) which allow for weighted and directed links between agents that are also adaptive over time. Thus, CDMFGs are able to model more complex connections than standard GMFGs. Besides a rigorous theoretical analysis including both existence and convergence guarantees, we employ the online mirror descent algorithm to learn equilibria. To conclude, we illustrate our findings with an epidemics model and a model of the systemic risk in financial markets. 2017 IEEE.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Ieee Control Systems Letters,adaptation models; agent-based systems; agents-based systems; complex nature; complex networks; control of networks; directed graphs; game; graphon; learning systems; limiting; machine learning; machine-learning; mean field games; mean-field games; modelling and controls; multi agent systems,"Fabian, C.

Thus, we construct multilayer information spillover networks between oil price shocks and GCC banking sectors. The empirical show that the Bahrain banking sector depicts the highest connectedness and risk transmission with oil price shocks on the extreme risk spillover layer.

"Ouyang, Z.; Zhou, X.",Multilayer networks in the frequency domain: measuring extreme risk connectedness of chinese financial institutions,"We propose multilayer networks in the frequency domain, including the short-term, medium-term, and long-term layers, to investigate the extreme risk connectedness among financial institutions. Using the conditional autoregressive value at risk (CAViaR) tool to measure the extreme risk of financial institutions, we construct extreme risk networks and inter-sector extreme risk networks of 36 Chinese financial institutions through the proposed approach. We observe that the extreme risk connectedness across financial institutions is heterogeneous in the short-, medium-, and long-term. In general, the long-term connectedness among financial institutions rises sharply during times of financial stress, such as the 2015 Chinese stock market turbulence and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we note that the insurers are key players in driving the inter-sector extreme risk networks, because the inter-sector systemic importance of insurance institutions is dominant.

We have employed the nonparametric conditional value-at-risk (NCoVaR), quantile cross-spectral coherency and Diebold and Yilmaz connectedness and spillover model as estimation techniques to achieve the s. Briefly, our full sample show that Bahrain is the only stock market to transfer dynamic spillover of volatility to OPEC oil prices. In contrast, all GCC stock markets except Saudi Arabia receive dynamic volatility from OPEC oil. Except for Bahrain, the NCoVaR relation exists in both directions between OPEC oil prices and the GCC markets. The pre-financial crisis period show that GCC stock markets do not transfer a dynamic spillover of volatility to OPEC oil prices. However, all GCC stock markets except Oman receive dynamic volatility from OPEC oil prices. Our lend further support to the argument that oil and stock markets behave like a market of one after the financialization of global commodities as we provide evidence of contagion between OPEC oil and the GCC stock market. Our also demonstrate that a better understanding of the dependency between OPEC oil prices and GCC equity markets will provide investors with information that will aid in making risk management decisions and designing investment strategies, as well as aiding policy makers to pursue sound energy and macroeconomic policies. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Empirical Economics,asymmetric connectedness; financial crisis; gcc; oil; quantile coherency; systemic risk,"Abakah, E.J.A.

"Huang, Y.; Liu, T.; Lien, D.",Portfolio homogeneity and systemic risk of financial networks,"The present study argues that systemic risk can be understood from two different perspectives, the homogeneity of asset portfolios held by different financial institutions and contagion mechanism. Existing works only emphasize contagion as the basic mechanism of financial crisis. Portfolio homogeneity increases the positive correlations among institutions and therefore the probability of simultaneous collapses of a considerable part of the network. When the contagion was fairly weak, a high portfolio homogeneity would lead to high systemic risk. But, if the contagion is considerably strong, the systemic risk would quite likely be negatively correlated to portfolio homogeneity. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2023-01-01,2,Journal of Empirical Finance,contagion; financial network; portfolio homogeneity; systemic risk,"Huang, Y.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so-called new vessels, at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high-risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC-PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one-fourth to one-third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre-retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre-retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight-threatening PDR stage. s: To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC-PDR in people with diabetes and DR. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. Selection criteria: We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case-control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults18 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC-PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text articles, to determine eligibility discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight yearstwo years) or lifelong. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random-effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta-analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework. MainWe screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty-five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case-control studies. Twenty-three studies evaluated participants with typediabetes (T1D), 19 with typediabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years. We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies. There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta-analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low- (LDL) and high- (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC-PDR. Authors'Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight-threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.

"Baes, M.; Schaanning, E.",Reverse stress testing: scenario design for macroprudential stress tests,"We propose a systematic algorithmic reverse-stress testing methodology to create worst case scenarios for regulatory stress tests by accounting for losses that arise from distressed portfolio liquidations. First, we derive the optimal bank response for any given shock. Then, we introduce an algorithm which systematically generates scenarios that exploit the key vulnerabilities in banks' portfolio holdings and thus maximize contagion despite banks' optimal response to the shock. We apply our methodology to data of the 2016 European Banking Authority (EBA) stress test, and design worst case scenarios for the portfolio holdings of European banks at the time. Using spectral clustering techniques, we group 10,000 worst-case scenarios into twelve geographically concentrated families. Our show that even though there is a wide range of different scenarios within these 12 families, each cluster tends to affect the same banks. An Anna Karenina principle of stress testing emerges: Not all stressful scenarios are alike, but every stressful scenario stresses the same banks. These findings suggest that the precise specification of a scenario is not of primal importance as long as the most vulnerable banks are targeted and sufficiently stressed. Finally, our methodology can be used to uncover the weakest links in the financial system and thereby focus supervisory attention on these, thus building a bridge between macroprudential and microprudential stress tests. 2022 The Authors.

"Wiersema, G.; Kleinnijenhuis, A.M.; Wetzer, T.; Farmer, J.D.",Scenario-free analysis of financial stability with interacting contagion channels,"Financial stress tests that capture multiple interactions between contagion channels are conditional on specific, subjectively-imposed stress scenarios. Eigenvalue-based approaches, in contrast, provide a scenario-independent measure of systemic stability, but so far only handle a single contagion mechanism. We develop an eigenvalue-based approach that brings the best of both worlds, enabling the analysis of multiple interacting contagion channels without the need to impose a subjective stress scenario. Our model captures the solvency-liquidity nexus, which allows us to demonstrate that the instability due to interacting channels can far exceed that of the sum of the individual channels acting in isolation. The framework we develop is flexible and allows for calibration to the microstructure and contagion channels of real financial systems. Building on this framework, we derive an analytic stability criterion in the limit of a large number of institutions that gives the instability threshold as a function of the relative size and intensity of contagion channels. This analytical formula requires comparatively little data to elucidate the mechanisms that drive instability in real financial systems and thus complements the insights gained from traditional stress tests. 2022",2023,2023-01-01,1,Journal of Banking and Finance,financial contagion; financial stability; interacting contagion channels; multiplex networks; solvency-liquidity nexus; stress test; systemic risk,"Wiersema, G.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling residents using a validated self-assessment as part of comprehensive health screening. Methods: The data were derived from comprehensive health screening (PORI75) for older adults of 75 years living in Western Finland in 2020 and 2021. One of 30 validated measures in health screening focused on identifying medication-related risk factors (LOTTA Checklist). The Checklist items were divided into (1) systemic risk factors (10 items) and (2) potentially drug-induced symptoms (10 items). Polypharmacy was categorized according to the number of used drugs: (1) no polypharmacy (5 drugs, that is, having polypharmacy. Of the systemic risk factors most common was that the resident had more than one physician responsible for the treatment (48% of the residents), followed by missing drug list (43%), missing regular monitoring (35%), and unclear durations of the medication (35%). The most experienced potentially drug-induced symptoms were self-reported constipation (21%), urinating problems (20%), and unusual tiredness (17%). An increasing number of drugs in use, particularly excessive polypharmacy, was associated with various medication-related risk factors. Conclusion: As a part of comprehensive health screening the LOTTA Checklist provides useful information to prevent medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling older adults. The Checklist could be used to guide planning and implementing health services in the future. 2023 The Authors.

"Lu, Y.; Li, Y.-N.; Wei, J.",Simple but logical: risk knowledge design and its impact on engagement in online knowledge communities,"Purpose: Online knowledge communities have emerged as crucial places for knowledge and risk management in the face of systemic risks. The vitality of online knowledge communities requires users’ active engagement. This research paper aims to explore how text complex level and text analytic level as effective risk knowledge design leverages encourage users’ engagement under different riskification levels. Design methodology approach: This paper performs linguistic analysis on 210 TED talk transcripts and 38,377 comments from 2002 to 2018. The authors construct the variable of text complex level and conduct ordinary least squares regressions to test the relationships among text complex level, text analytic level and user engagement under different levels of riskification in the online knowledge community. Findings: High text complex level decreases engagement, while high text analytic level increases engagement. A high level of riskification exaggerates the negative effect of text complex level but diminishes the positive effect of the text analytic level. Originality value: This research advances knowledge management by highlighting users’ engagement and responding to shared risk knowledge from a different perspective than knowledge supply. The focus on risk communication in online knowledge communities broadens the scope of knowledge management literature beyond the confines of organizations. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is among the first studies to propose risk knowledge design approaches for communicating systemic risks. 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,2023-01-01,1,Journal of Knowledge Management,engagement; knowledge design; online knowledge community; risk communication; systemic risks; text analytic level; text complex level,"Lu, Y.

"Mensi, W.; Hanif, W.; Bouri, E.; Vo, X.V.",Spillovers and tail dependence between oil and US sectoral stock markets before and during COVID-19 pandemic,"Purpose: This paper examines the extreme dependence and asymmetric risk spillovers between crude oil futures and ten US stock sector indices (consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, financials, health care, industrials, information technology, materials, telecommunication and utilities) before and during COVID-19 outbreak. This study is based on the rationale that stock sectors exhibit heterogeneity in their response to oil prices depending on whether they are classified as oil-intensive or non-oil-intensive sectors and the possible time variation in the dependence and risk spillover effects. Design methodology approach: The authors employ static and dynamic symmetric and asymmetric copula models as well as Conditional Value at Risk (VaR) (CoVaR). Finally, they use robustness tests to validate theirFindings: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil returns showed an asymmetric tail dependence with all stock sector returns, except health care and industrials (materials), where an average (symmetric tail) dependence is identified. During the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil returns exhibit a lower tail dependency with the returns of all stock sectors, except financials and consumer discretionary. Furthermore, there is evidence of downside and upside risk asymmetric spillovers from crude oil to stock sectors and vice versa. Finally, the risk spillovers from stock sectors to crude oil are higher than those from crude oil to stock sectors, and they significantly increase during the pandemic. Originality value: There is heterogeneity in the linkages and the asymmetric bidirectional systemic risk between crude oil and US economic sectors during bearish and bullish market conditions this study is the first to investigate the average and extreme tail dependence and asymmetric spillovers between crude oil and US stock sectors. 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,2023-01-01,1,International Journal of Emerging Markets,covid-19; crude oil; extreme spillovers; tail dependence; us stock sectors,"Mensi, W.

"Morelli, G.",Stochastic ordering of systemic risk in commodity markets,"The contribution of commodity risks to the systemic risk is assessed in this paper through a novel approach that relies on the stochastic property of concordance ordering of CoVaR. Considering the period that spans from 2005 to 2022 and the VIX as the proxy for the stability of the financial system, we build the stochastic ordering of systemic risk for 35 commodities belonging to four sectors: Agriculture, Energy, Industrial Metals, and Precious Metals. The estimates of the ΔCoVaR signal that contagion effects from commodity markets to the financial system have been stronger during the years 2017 2019. Backtests validate CoVaR as a more resilient risk measure than the VaR, especially during periods of market turmoils. The stochastic ordering of CoVaR shows that severe losses (downside risk) in commodity markets tend to exacerbate systemic financial distress more than gains (upside risk). Commodity risks arising from WTI and EUA are threatening triggers for systemic risk. In contrast, the financial system is less vulnerable to a broader range of scenarios arising from fluctuations in Gold prices.

"Ponrajah, J.; Ning, C.",Stock bond dependence and flight to from quality,"This paper investigates the stock bond dependence structure using a dependence-switching copula model. The model allows stock bond dependence to switch between positive dependence regimes (contagions or crashes of the two markets during downturns or booms in both markets during upturns) and negative dependence regimes (flight-to-quality from stock markets to bond markets or flight-from-quality from bond markets to stock markets). Using data from four developed markets including the US, Canada, Germany, and France for the period between January 1985 and August 2022, we find that the within-country stock bond (extreme) dependence could be both positive and negative. In the positive dependence regimes, the stock bond dependence is asymmetric with stronger left tail dependence than the right tail dependence, giving evidence of a higher likelihood of joint stock bond market crashes or contagions during market downturns than the collective stock bond market booms. Under the negative dependence regimes, we find both flight-from-quality and flight-to-quality, with flight-to-quality being more dominant in the North American markets while flight-from-quality is more prominent in the European markets. Further, the dependence switches between positive and negative regimes over time. Moreover, the dependence is mainly in the positive regimes before 2000 while mostly in the negative regimes after that, indicating contagions mostly before 2000 and flights afterwards. Further, the dependence switches between positive and negative regimes around financial crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. These greatly enrich the findings in the existing literature on the co-movements of stock bond markets and are important for risk management and asset pricing. 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2023,2023-01-01,0,International Review of Financial Analysis,contagion; dependence-switching copula; flight-from-quality; flight-to-quality; systemic risk; tail dependence,"Ponrajah, J.

Thus, understanding systemic risk is crucial for the nancial institutions, large corporations, investors and regulators. This article investigates systemic risk and spilloverect using the new Financial Risk Meter ((Formula presented.)) index, which is obtained from running quantile linear regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator ((Formula presented.)) method. The (Formula presented.) index is obtained to identify the highly risky periods, the contributors to systemic risk and the potential activators of spilloverect. Moreover, interconnection between rms can be visualized as a network. We use a data set consisting of daily stock returns from 35 nancial institutions and real estate rms in Vietnam, combined withmacroeconomic variables over the period from November 2011 to December 2020. The ndings indicate that over the considered period, some detected highly risky periods are 2012, 2018 and 2020, probably due to the non-performing loan crisis in Vietnam, US-China trade war and global COVID-19 outbreak.

"Zhang, X.; Wei, C.; Lee, C.-C.; Tian, Y.",Systemic risk of chinese financial institutions and asset price bubbles,"Although there has not been a large-scale systemic crisis in China, high-risk financial events have occurred continuously in recent years. This research thus creatively analyzes the determinants of systemic risk for Chinese financial institutions from the view of asset price bubbles. First, we identify bubbles in the China stock and real estate markets on the basis of the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) model and explain the reasons for bubble formations according to the stage of China's economic development and policies implementation. At this stage, considering the differences in economic development levels of different cities, the real estate bubbles in the first, second and third tier cities and the whole country were innovatively identified. Second, on the basis of the DCG-GARCH-CoVaR model to measure the systemic risk of listed financial institutions in China and to classify institutions, the show that the main source of such risk is the banking sector. Furthermore, by constructing regression models, stock market bubbles and real estate bubbles both positively correlate with systemic risk throughout the sample period. Meanwhile, the impact of bubbles on the systemic risk of different types of financial institutions was taken into account so that regulators prioritized different types of institutions with different characteristics when faced with decisions. Finally, we provide macro-prudential policy advice to regulators in order to weaken the impact of bubbles on financial stability to avoid systemic crises. 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023,2023-01-01,7,North American Journal of Economics and Finance,asset price bubbles; dcc-garch-covar model; financial institutions; stock markets; systemic risk,"Zhang, X.

"Coral, C.; Mithöfer, D.",The backbone of agrifood value chain resilience: innovation in the ecuadorian banana value chain from a historical perspective,"Given the accelerated global shifts and disruptions to agrifood value chains, an approach is required that reveals multiple drivers, recognizable patterns, and behaviors that can be understood and navigated towards value chain resilience. This research shares roots with and builds further on resilience approaches, the concept of upgrading in global value chains and innovation to contribute to the study of agrifood value chain resilience. The analysis is based on narratives extracted from interviews with local actors in the chain. Narrative, as formed from a combination of temporal succession and causality, helps us track the chain's historical trajectory, identify critical historical and contemporary drivers of change and actors’ adaptations to historical events, the latest being the Covid-19 pandemic. Our study finds that main drivers, such as natural hazards, market dynamics, actors’ organization, and digital and technological innovation, have been key to Covid-19 adaptation. These constitute crucial areas for policy action and management of systemic risk. For example, previous experience with the fungal disease Foc TR4 one year before the Covid-19 pandemic has been perceived as a key factor in easing Covid-19 adaptation. The analysis shows that some shocks may be challenging to predict, while others may result from the chronic build-up of vulnerabilities, such as the impacts of climate change or the spread of transboundary diseases. As observed in this study, the backbone of overall agrifood value chain resilience and Covid-19 adaptation lie in experiential learning and build on the past hence, identifying lessons from past innovations is crucial to finding solutions in novel contexts and to deriving opportunities for agrifood value chain development. 2022 The Authors",2023,2023-01-01,1,World Development Perspectives,agrifood value chain development; agrifood value chain innovation; agrifood value chain resilience; covid-19 adaptation; drivers of change in agrifood value chains; resilience,"Coral, C.

It argues that, while resilience in peacebuilding lends agency and new policy direction to peacebuilding actors, enabling them to uphold the image of active global governance, this also helps to legitimize the existence and reproduction of dominant global-capitalist structures and practices that undermine long-term peacebuilding and give rise to risks of conflict and environmental disasters in the first place.

Using quarterly panel data of 16 listed commercial banks in China, this study examines the impact of climate change on banking systemic risk from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. It focuses on two path mechanisms through asset volatility and credit quality as well as the heterogeneity of effects. The study finds that (1) climate change will significantly increase the level of bank systemic risk spillovers and non-state-owned commercial banks are more affected than state-owned commercial banks (2) asset volatility and credit quality mediate how climate change affects banks’ systemic risk and (3) the influence path of climate change on the systemic risk of state-owned commercial banks is climate change asset volatility credit risk systematic risk. However, the mediating effect of asset volatility on non-state-owned commercial banks is not significant, whereas credit quality shows a partial mediating effect. Accordingly, this study advances policy suggestions on strategic management, interventions, and the risk prevention system for banks’ climate risk from the perspectives of macro-prudential regulation and micro-risk management. 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",2023,2023-01-01,0,Economic Analysis and Policy,climate change; commercial bank; financial regulation; intermediary effect; systemic risk,"Wu, X.

"Al-Shari, H.A.; Lokhande, M.A.",The relationship between the risks of adopting fintech in banks and their impact on the performance,"Banks give great attention to identifying the risks of adopting FinTech and the extent of its negative impact on their business. This study aims to explore the relationship between the risks of adopting FinTech in banks and their impact on performance, where the balanced scorecard was used to measure performance. This study identifies four risks, which are the most important risks affecting FinTech in banks: systemic risks, operational risks, outsourcing risks, and cyber risks. The data was collected through a questionnaire for 263 respondents at the managerial level of bank branches in Yemen from October to December 2021. Structural equation modeling PLS-SEM and a disjoint two-stage approach were used to approve the model’s constructs. The current study proved the validity of the proposed relationship between the risks and the effect of risk variables on each other, except for the impact of outsourcing risks on cyber risks. Also, the study result is that cyber risks and operational risks of adopting FinTech have a negative impact on banks’ performance. But the outsourcing risks of the adoption of FinTech have a positive impact on banks’ performance the systemic risks do not affect banks’ performance. Therefore, this study is considered one of the rare studies that contribute to analyzing the risks of adopting FinTech in banks and its impact on performance. In addition, it gives a clear picture for decision-makers in banks to identify the dark side of FinTech adoption. 2023 The Author(s).

"Maskrey, A.; Jain, G.; Lavell, A.",The social construction of systemic risk: towards an actionable framework for risk governance,"Purpose: This paper explores the building blocks of risk governance systems that are equipped to manage systemic risk in the 21st century. Whilst approaches to risk governance have been evolving for more than a decade, recent disasters have shown that conventional risk management solutions need to be complemented with a multidimensional risk approach to govern complex risks and prevent major, often simultaneous, crises with cascading and knock-on effects on multiple, interrelated systems at scale. The paper explores which risk governance innovations will be essential to provide the enabling environment for sustainable development that is resilient to interrelated shocks and risks. Design methodology approach: This interdisciplinary literature review-based thought piece highlights how systemic risk is socially constructed and identifies guiding principles for systemic risk governance that could be actionable by and provide entry points for local and national governments, civil society and the private sector. particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), in a way that is relevant to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This considers preparedness, response and resilience, but more importantly prospective and corrective risk control and reduction strategies and mechanisms. Only when systemic risk is framed in a way that is relevant to the political agendas of countries will it be possible to begin a dialogue for its governance. Findings: The paper identifies opportunities at the global, national and local levels, which together draw up a viable framework for systemic risk governance that (1) embraces the governance of sustainability and resilience through a strengthened holistic governance framework for social, economic, territorial and environmental development (2) improves managing conventional risk to ultimately manage systemic risks (3) fosters the understanding of vulnerability and exposure to gain insight into systemic risk (4) places a greater focus on prospective risk management (5) manages systemic risk in local infrastructure systems, supply chains and ecosystems (6) shifts the focus from protecting privatized gains to managing socialized risk. Originality value: The choices and actions that societies take on the path of their development are contributing intentionally or unintentionally to the construction of systemic risks, which result in knock-on effects among interconnected social, environmental, political and economic systems. These risks are manifesting in major crises with cascading effects and a real potential to undermine the achievement of the SDGs, as COVID-19 is a stark reminder of.

"Barnett, W.A.; Wang, X.; Xu, H.-C.; Zhou, W.-X.",The stable tail dependence and influence among the european stock markets: a score-driven dynamic copula approach,"This paper studies the time-varying tail dependence among the European stock markets and assesses the influence of individual financial markets. By utilizing two generalized autoregressive score (GAS) copulas, we compute the tail dependence for 11 European stock indexes andAmerican stock index over the last 16 years. Notably, it is found that the dependencies among European stock indexes are generally stable, even during the crisis periods. Then an influence measure is proposed for each individual market based on the tail dependence. Interestingly, the influence ranking is also stable for both the whole period and two big drawdown days in crisis periods. To be specific, AEX (Netherlands), FCHI (France), and GDAXI (Germany) always show the most significant influences, while SPX (USA) is always the least influential one. Finally, an equal-weighted portfolio is built to measure the systemic risk in the European stock markets. It is found that both patterns of risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are different from the time-varying tail dependence. There exist obvious inverted spikes on 16 October 2008 and 16 March 2020. The indicate that the extreme portfolio risk does not come from the increase of dependence among European stock markets, but from the individual jumps. 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2023,2023-01-01,0,European Journal of Finance,european stock markets; generalized autoregressive score; tail dependence; time-varying copula,"Barnett, W.A.

Buried drusen manifests as pseudopapilledema. The compressive effects of ONH drusen can rarely precipitate central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The superimposition of pseudopapilledema on disc edema in CRVO poses a diagnostic dilemma. A 40-year-old female without systemic comorbidities presented with resolving CRVO. An exhaustive systemic workup revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasonography demonstrated buried ONH drusen.

"Sulfikkar, A.M.; Sarmah, T.; Dabral, A.; Chatterjee, R.; Shaw, R.","Unpacking systemic, cascading, and compound risks: A case based analysis of asia pacific","The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction aims to reduce disaster risk and loss by prioritizing activities that promote a better understanding of disaster risk. It prioritizes activities such as understanding disaster risk and its dimensions, with a focus on preventing the creation of new risks, reducing existing ones, and preparing for residual risks. The concept of systemic, cascading, and compound risks is becoming increasingly important in disaster risk management. However, there is a lack of understanding about these terms and how they overlap and differ in real-world applications. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the evolving and underlying risk patterns in our interconnected society, making it crucial to bridge this gap. The paper explores the existing literature on systemic, cascading, and compound risks, using a secondary literature review and content analysis. It provides a conceptual overview of the three risks and supports the review with an analysis of 40 case studies in the Asia Pacific region. The analysis focuses on the hazards, underlying vulnerabilities, impacted systems, and the complex interconnections between them. Based on the findings, the authors provide recommendations for the management of systemic, cascading, and compound risks in the future. 2023",2023,2023-01-01,0,Progress in Disaster Science,cascading risk; compound risk; covid-19; disaster management; disaster risk management; honshu; japan; literature review; miyagi; natural disaster; pacific rim; prioritization; resilience; risk assessment; sendai; spatiotemporal analysis; systemic risk; tohoku,"Sulfikkar Ahamed, M.

"Peters, F.; Neuberger, D.; Reinhardt, O.; Uhrmacher, A.",A basic macroeconomic agent-based model for analyzing monetary regime shifts,"In macroeconomics, an emerging discussion of alternative monetary systems addresses the dimensions of systemic risk in advanced financial systems. Monetary regime changes with the aim of achieving a more sustainable financial system have already been discussed in several European parliaments and were the subject of a referendum in Switzerland. However, their effectiveness and efficacy concerning macro-financial stability are not well-known. This paper defines the economic requirements for modeling the current monetary system and introduces the corresponding macroeconomic agent-based model (MABM) in a continuous-time stochastic agent-based simulation environment with a provenance model. This MABM aims to present a starting point for exploring and analyzing monetary reforms. In this context, the monetary system affects the lending potential of banks and might impact the dynamics of financial crises. MABMs are predestined to replicate emergent financial crisis dynamics, analyze institutional changes within a financial system, and thus measure macro-financial stability. The used simulation environment makes the model more accessible and facilitates exploring the impact of different hypotheses and mechanisms in a less complex way. Moreover, the model replicates a wide range of stylized economic facts, which validates it as an analysis tool to implement and compare monetary regime shifts. 2022 Peters et al.

"Aygun, N.K.; Bulut, O.; Biyik, E.",A framework for capacity expansion planning in failure-prone flow-networks via systemic risk analysis,"In this article, a capacity expansion framework is proposed for failure-prone flow-networks. A systemic risk measure that quantifies the risk of unsatisfied demand due to cascaded edge failures is considered. To minimize the total cost of additional edge capacities, while keeping the risk of unsatisfied demand below a certain threshold, a general stochastic optimization problem is formulated. The distribution of unsatisfied demand is calculated via Monte-Carlo simulations embodied within a grid search algorithm that identifies the feasible region. Thereafter, the cost-optimal edge capacity expansion plan is computed by a differential evolution algorithm. Contributions of this article are: 1) consideration of both immediate investment and future risk costs of capacity expansion plans 2) a generic flow-network model that can be tuned for different real-life applications 3) addressing the stochastic nature of both supply and demand simultaneously within a systemic risk framework 4) use of eigenvector centrality for edge grouping in systemic risk analysis. An extensive numerical study is performed to investigate the effects of different edge grouping methods, characteristics of stochastic components, and cost parameters on the feasible region and optimal solution. The proposed framework is also demonstrated on a case study adapted from ERCOT 13-bus test system. 2007-2012 IEEE.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Ieee Systems Journal,capacity expansion planning; cascading failures; cost benefit analysis; differential evolution (de); differential evolution algorithms; economics; eigenvector centralities; evolutionary algorithms; failure (mechanical); flow network modeling; flow-networks; grid search algorithm (gsa); grid-search algorithm; investments; monte carlo methods; numerical methods; optimization; real-life applications; risk analysis; risk assessment; stochastic component; stochastic models; stochastic optimization problems; stochastic programming; stochastic systems; systemic risk,"Aygun, N.K.

The reciprocal influence between insurers is indeed considered in each period and in subsequent periods, calibrating arc weights on the basis of specific risk measures.

"Haas, A.; Laubichler, M.; Applegate, J.; Steudle, G.; Jaeger, C.C.",A proposal for integrating theories of complexity for better understanding global systemic risks,"The global financial crisis of 2008 has shown that the present financial system involves global systemic risks. The dimension of these risks is hard to grasp with the conceptual tools that have been developed to tackle conventional risks like fire or car accidents. While modern societies know quite well how to deal with conventional risks, we have not yet been equally successful at dealing with global systemic risks. For managing this kind of risks, one needs to understand critical features of specific global systems where many human agents interact in ever changing complex networks. Here we apply two specific dimensions of complexity theory for dealing with global systemic risk in an integrated fashion: normal accidents and extended evolution. Both of them have successfully been applied to the analysis of systemic risks. As a paradigmatic example of global systemic risks, we focus on the global financial crisis that began in 2008, and suggest that the future evolution of the financial system could either see a further increase in complexity, or a reversal to a less complex system. We explore and contrast the implications of normal accident theory and extended evolution perspectives and suggest a four-point research strategy informed by complexity theory for better understanding global systemic risks in financial systems. 2020 The Authors.

"Xiong, S.; Chen, W.",A robust hybrid method using dynamic network analysis and weighted mahalanobis distance for modeling systemic risk in the international energy market,"This paper proposes a novel hybrid method called Weighted Turbulence, which combines the dynamic network and weighted Mahalanobis distance to measure the overall systemic risk level of the international energy markets system. We simultaneously capture two essential drivers of systemic risk on international energy markets, including the abnormal price behavior of the single market and the interconnectedness among different energy markets, as the fundamental points of our modeling. It makes our proposed model can characterize the larger influential level of the abnormal behavior of the core energy market than that of the periphery markets on the systemic risk level and eliminate the negative impact of the non-systematic markets of the targeted markets system on the systemic risk measuring, which few existing schemes can achieve that. The empirical study further confirms the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed model. It can accurately detect the spikes of systemic risk in international energy markets, and the measuring are unaffected by the interference of the noise data.

"Li, J.",Asymptotic analysis of a dynamic systemic risk measure in a renewal risk model,"In the context of insurance, we propose a dynamic systemic risk measure based on a multi-dimensional renewal risk model to describe the instant expected shortfall of an insurer at the moment when one of its business lines suffers crisis (i.e., deficit). The asymptotic behavior of the measure is studied in both the asymptotic independence and asymptotic dependence cases, and some asymptotic formulas with the uniformity in the whole time horizon are derived when the claim size distributions belong to the class of regular variation. The obtained do not depend on specific setups of the renewal claim-number process, and they are also insensitive to specific dependence structures in the asymptotic independence case. These facts make our concise in form and flexible in application. More interestingly, our for the corresponding discounted version of the measure have nothing to do with the time variable. Hence, the discounted version of the measure can be regarded approximately as a static (i.e., time-invariant) risk measure of the dynamic system. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Insurance: Mathematics and Economics,asymptotic behavior; dependence; dynamic systemic risk measure; regular variation,"Li, J.

Exploiting the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008, we find that TARP funds temporarily decreased the likelihood of bank CEO turnover during the crisis (2008 2010) but significantly increased CEO changes afterwards. Our show that replacing TARP CEOs reduced individual bank's risk as well as the bank's contributions to the systemic risk.

In this paper, Chinese bank networks in different COVID-19 periods were constructed using CoVaR model and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and the characteristics and risk changes of the proposed bank networks were analyzed based on complex network theory. Additionally, the index of complex network theory was combined with the non-performing loan ratio of banks to build a new index for evaluating and measuring the systemic risk of banks in different periods. It was found that the network density, clustering coefficient and average network strength of banking networks increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the level of inter-bank correlation, and the systemic risk of banking networks increased. It was suggested after using the new indicators that joint-stock commercial banks and rural commercial banks were the main risk spillovers in different periods, and the systemic risk of these banks had increased during COVID-19. Therefore, the supervision of joint-stock commercial and rural commercial banks should be strengthened to prevent the risks from spreading to these banks during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2022 The Author(s)",2022,2022-01-01,0,Heliyon,banking network; covar; systemic risk; topological characteristics,"Luo, H.

We also show that their efficacy in mitigating instability is quite heterogeneous and may vary depending on the set of tools implemented, as well as bank’ size, TBTF, leverage, liquidity and concentration. Our bear critical policy implications for implementing optimal macroprudential tools and provide insights into the trade-off between financial vis- -vis price stability. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,1,"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money",complementarity; financial stability; macroprudential policies; monetary policy; systemic risk,"Apergis, N.

"Liu, L.; Le, H.; Thompson, S.",CEO overconfidence and bank systemic risk: evidence froms bank holding companies,"Following the 2007 2008 financial crisis, the attention of financial regulators and academics has shifted from bank individual risk to bank systemic risk, that is, banks' exposure to future systemic crises. In this paper, we examine whether CEO overconfidence could explain cross-sectional heterogeneity in the systemic risk of U.S. bank holding companies. Using measures of overconfidence based on CEOs' options exercise behaviour and language used in the Managerial Discussion and Analysis of the 10K-filings, we find that banks with overconfident CEOs have higher systemic risk than their counterparts with non-overconfident CEOs. Banks with overconfident CEOs also have higher holding of private mortgage-backed securities and higher leverage. During the 2007 2008 financial crisis, banks with overconfident CEOs experienced higher realized systemic risk. Our work shows that the behaviour of overconfident bank CEOs could impose negative externalities beyond individual bank boundary. 2020 The Authors.

The time series of these estimates allow us to understand systemic risk and its concentration in the banking sector over time.

SETTING: Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. DESIGN: Retrospective hospital-based study. METHODS: Of the167 250 patients who underwent cataract surgery between 2008 and 2020, patients diagnosed with intraoperative ECH were included. Demography, ocular and systemic risk factors, visual acuity, type of ocular anesthesia, intraoperative and postoperative records, management, and surgical outcomes were analyzed.52 eyes (0.004%) of167 250 patients had ECH. Of the 52 cases, 43 cases (incidence rate 0.006%) were reported in the years 2008 to 2015 andcases (incidence rate 0.002%) in the years 2016 to 2020. The change in the ocular anesthesia from peribulbar and retrobulbar anesthesia (2008 to 2015) to sub-Tenon anesthesia (2016 to 2020) was associated with a reduced rate of ECHP .002). 28 eyes (53.8%) experienced limited ECH and 24 eyes (46.2%) full-blown ECH. The visual outcome was better in eyes with limited ECH compared with full-blown suprachoroidal hemorrhage in all follow-up visits. The median vision (interquartile range) before the cataract surgery and at postoperative daywere 1.30 (0.78 to 2.60) and 2.45 (1 to 2.75), respectively. The median final vision (interquartile range) after the secondary surgical intervention was 2.2 (0.60 to 2.60).This series included 52 eyes with ECH, recognized associations of ECH with different types of anesthesia and with different cataract surgical procedures, and described management of ECH. Postoperative visual outcome was poor.

"Jarrow, R.; Protter, P.; Quintos, A.",Computing the probability of a financial market failure: a new measure of systemic risk,"This paper characterizes the probability of a market failure defined as the default of two or more globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in a small interval of time. The default probabilities of the G-SIBs are correlated through the possible existence of a market-wide stress event. The characterization employs a multivariate Cox process across the G-SIBs, which allows us to relate our work to the existing literature on intensity-based models. Various theorems related to market failure probabilities are derived, including the probability of a market failure due to two banks defaulting over the next infinitesimal interval, the probability of a catastrophic market failure, the impact of increasing the number of G-SIBs in an economy, and the impact of changing the initial conditions of the economy’s state variables. We also show that if there are too many G-SIBs, a market failure is inevitable, i.e., the probability of a market failure tends to 1. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Annals of Operations Research,g-sibs; market failure probabilities; multivariate cox processes; systemic risk,"Jarrow, R.

"Irawan, D.; Okimoto, T.",Conditional capital surplus and shortfall across renewable and non-renewable resource firms,"This study examines the conditional capital surplus and shortfall dynamics of renewable and non-renewable resource firms. To this end, this study uses the systemic risk index by Brownlees and Engle (2017) and considers two conditional systemic events, namely, a stock market crash and a commodity price crash. The indicate that generally, companies in the resource sector tend to have conditional capital shortfall before 2000 and conditional capital surplus after 2000 owing to the boom of the commodity sector stocks and moderate capital structure management adopted by these companies. This finding is especially valid for resource firms in developed countries, whose observations dominate the dataset used in this study. Furthermore, the analysis using the panel vector autoregressive model indicates a positive influence of commodity price and geopolitical uncertainties on the conditional capital shortfall. These uncertainties have also been proven to increase the conditional failure probability of resource firms in the sample. Lastly, the performance analysis shows that potential capital shortfall is positively related to market returns, reflecting a high-risk high-return trade-off for the resource sector. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,5,Energy Economics,alternative energy; capital market; commodity price; commodity prices; costs; economic and social effects; electricity industry; energy market; energy resource; financial markets; geopolitics; macroeconomic uncertainties; macroeconomic uncertainty; macroeconomics; nonrenewable resource; panel vector autoregression; probability; regression analysis; renewable and non-renewable resources; risk assessment; risk indices; systematic risk; systematic risk index; systemic risks; uncertainty; uncertainty analysis; vector autoregressions,"Irawan, D.

"Wang, G.-J.; Feng, Y.; Xiao, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Xie, C.",Connectedness and systemic risk of the banking industry along the belt and road,"This paper adopts the tail-event driven network (TENET) framework to explore the connectedness and systemic risk of the banking industry along the Belt and Road (B R) based on weekly returns of 377 publicly-listed banks from 2014 to 2019. We conduct the connectedness analysis from four levels (i.e., system, region, country and institution) and identify the systemic risk contribution of banks. We find that the dynamic total connectedness reached its peak during the outbreak of the abnormal fluctuations of Chinese stock market in 2015-2016 and its trough during the Brexit vote, and subsequently experienced several periodic fluctuations at a relatively high position. In theR banking system, the intra-regional tail risk spillovers are remarkably stronger than the inter-regional tail risk spillovers during the post-crisis period. In addition, the panel regressions estimated by the least squares dummy variable model show that the cross-border merger and acquisitions (M As) and the merchandise trade export are important drivers for the tail-connectedness across theR countries.

"Yoon, D.-E.; Choudhury, T.; Saha, A.K.; Rashid, M.",Contagion risk: cases of islamic and emerging market banks,"Purpose: Globally influential Islamic banks from the Middle East and Southeast Asia carry voluminous correspondence banking with banks from China and India, leading to potential spillover effect of contagion among the banks from these regions. This study aims to investigate the Islamic banks systemic risk contagion with major banks from China and India. Design methodology approach: Having the option pricing theory in the backdrop, the authors calculated three different distance to risk measurements (default, insolvency and capital). The authors have included top six listed globally influential Islamic banks, top seven Indian banks and top eight Chinese banks based on their net asset value. They then measured the banks’ extreme shocks based on the extreme value theory by using the logistic regression model. These extreme shocks helped the authors to map the spillover among the selected banks from multiple regions. Findings: The authors have found strong evidences of directional risk spillover among the banks in this sample. Islamic banks are receiving a significant risk spillover from the other sample banks but transmitting less toward the other banks from India and China. Hence, there is strong one-directional risk contagion toward the Islamic banks in the study sample. Practical implications: This research would be particularly useful to the regulators and bankers from emerging and Islamic markets to understand the conniving nature of the crisis by effectively mapping the source, destination and implementation of the shock transmission mechanism of the potential financial contagion. Originality value: Even though the corresponding banking among the top Islamic banks from the Middle East and Southeast Asian countries, and banks from India and China, is on the rise, the assessment of risk among these banks has been limited. In particular, the authors extended on the extreme value theory to focus on the wider impact of spillover, including significant direction of contagion from non-Islamic banks to Islamic banks. 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,2022-01-01,8,International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management,distance to capital; distance to default; emerging market banks; extreme value theory; islamic banks,"Yoon, D.-E.

The interbank network is studied to understand the contagion process within a network considering differences in the network structure and the characteristics of components. Simulations support the claim that heterogeneous networks are more resilient to contagious shocks, while these shocks are more problematic in homogeneous networks. This paper also shows that more interconnections among banks could accelerate or block the contagion process, depending on the structure of the network and the seniority of debts in the interbank network. 2022, Faculty of Social Sciences.

"Chen, X.; Dong, Y.; Hunt, K.; Zhuang, J.",Counterterrorism resource allocation during a pandemic: the effects of dynamic target valuations when facing a strategic terrorist,"The outbreak of pandemics such as COVID-19 can result in cascading effects for global systemic risk. To combat an ongoing pandemic, governmental resources are largely allocated toward supporting the health of the public and economy. This shift in attention can lead to security vulnerabilities which are exploited by terrorists. In view of this, counterterrorism during a pandemic is of critical interest to the safety and well-being of the global society. Most notably, the population flows among potential targets are likely to change in conjunction with the trend of the health crisis, which leads to fluctuations in target valuations. In this situation, a new challenge for the defender is to optimally allocate his her resources among targets that have changing valuations, where his her intention is to minimize the expected losses from potential terrorist attacks. In order to deal with this challenge, in this paper, we first develop a defender attacker game in sequential form, where the target valuations can change as a result of the pandemic. Then we analyze the effects of a pandemic on counterterrorism resource allocation from the perspective of dynamic target valuations. Finally, we provide some examples to display the theoreticaland present a case study to illustrate the usability of our proposed model during a pandemic. 2022 Society for Risk Analysis.",2022,2022-01-01,1,Risk Analysis,cascading effects; counter terrorism; counterterrorism resource allocations; dynamic target; economics; game theory; homeland security; national security; pandemic; resource allocation; resources allocation; security systems; security vulnerabilities; systemic risks; target valuation; target valuations; terrorism; well being,"Chen, X.

In this paper, we first sketch a toy model that produces normal mixture distributions based on a dynamic regime switching model. We derive that the relative concavity among various indices tends to increase before a crisis. Using Polymodel theory, we introduce a measure of concavity as a crisis risk indicator, and test it against known crises observed in the past.

"Hanger-Kopp, S.; Palka, M.",Decision spaces in agricultural risk management: a mental model study of austrian crop farmers,"Drought has become a dominant climate risk both around the world and in Europe, adding to the already challenging task of farming and governing the agricultural sector under climate change. Drought risk management is extremely complex. Apart from irrigation, most drought risk management options have more than one goal and may potentially have negative trade-offs with other risk management s. Moreover, government regulations and market mechanisms influence farmers’ decision-making. However, previous studies, both in developed and in developing countries, have predominantly focused on attitudinal and structural influencing factors on farmers’ risk management behavior. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate farmers’ decision spaces with respect to drought risk management. We address two applied research questions: (1) What are farmers’ preferred drought risk management measures (2) From a farmer’s perspective, what are the dominant factors influencing drought risk management decisions We find that farmers primarily think of production-based rather than financial measures with respect to drought risk management. At the same time, natural and technical constraints and enabling factors dominate their mental decision space, followed by public and private institutional aspects. This research provides a basis for the design of integrated and holistic drought risk management policy and the drought risk governance needed for sustainable use of land and water resources such as needed to address systemic risks and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach using mental models extracted from interviews to explore cognitive representations of farmers' decision spaces. This approach has the potential to complement mainstream research using standardized surveys and behavioral models to analyze drivers of risk management. 2021, The Author(s).",2022,2022-01-01,3,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",agricultural market; agriculture; climate change; climate risk; complexity; decision making; decision space; developing world; disaster management; drought; europe; mental model; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; risk management; sustainable development goal,"Hanger-Kopp, S.

"Jiao, S.; Ye, W.",Dependence and systemic risk analysis betweenp 500 index and sector indexes: A conditional value-at-risk approach,"In order to investigate the dynamic dependency structure between theP 500 stock index and 11 different U.S. sector indexes, and measure systemic risk. We first propose a new dynamic copula model with Markov regime-switching and macroeconomic component, and use a simulation study to verify its advantages. Macroeconomic components identified by principal component analysis and independent component analysis are added into the evolution of the copula parameter as exogenous variables to study the influence of macroeconomic factors on the interdependence between variables. Then, the estimation method of systemic risk measure conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) in the proposed dynamic copula model is given. Finally, we provide an empirical analysis based on the above data and models. We find that when extreme events occur in theP500, the CoVaRs corresponding to sector indexes are distinctly time-varying, and the occurrence of major events have a greater impact on the CoVaR of each index. The consideration of Markov regime-switching parameters and macroeconomic factors improves the ability to estimate dependent structures. In addition, different macroeconomic factors have different influences on the interdependence between sector indexes and the overallP. U.S. unemployment rate is the most important macroeconomic factor for most sectors. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Computational Economics,covar; regime-switching copula; sector indexes; systemic risk,"Jiao, S.

Researchers used purposive sampling to ensure the suitability of the sample with the research s. Furthermore, we use secondary data obtained from financial databases such as Yahoo Finance and the Indonesia Stock Exchange. This study adopts the systemic risk measurement offered by Fiordelisi and Marquez-Ibanez (2013). The determinants of systemic risk were explored from the six independent variables, namely the bank efficiency, business model, size, interest rate, GDP, and bank categories (Islamic or conventional). Data analysis was performed with panel data regression. The indicate that size is the critical factor in determining potential systemic risk for banks, both Islamic and conventional banks. This study contributes theoretically in constructing theoretical frameworks related to the stability and resilience of Islamic banks in comparison with conventional banks.

"Xu, C.; Jin, B.","Digital currency in china: pilot implementations, legal challenges and prospects","Digital currency is supported by blockchain as the underlying technology, and possesses the characteristics of decentralization, programmability, and security verification based on cryptographic principles. In fact, it can be divided into legal digital currency and non-legal digital currency depending to whether the digital currency is issued by the competent authority. China’s legal digital currency (DC EP) has implemented early and already has a certain scale of development. This article examines the legal issues that arise from the implementation of a legal digital currency in China, issues that Chinese lawmakers inevitably face. These legal issues may arise at both domestic and international levels, such as personal privacy protection, currency sovereignty conflicts, potential cross-border crimes risks. This article emphasizes that on the one hand, the development of legal digital currency must be carried out within a reasonable legal framework to avoid new systemic risks caused by the development of technology. On the other hand, it is also necessary for China to put in place as soon as possible an appropriate legal framework, explore the international cooperation of diversified supervision as well to ensure the healthy development of legal digital currency. 2022, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

"Bax, K.; Bonaccolto, G.; Paterlini, S.","Do lower environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rated companies have higher systemic impact empirical evidence from europe and the united states","In recent years, companies have increasingly been characterized by environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, and investors and academics have raised questions concerning financial performance and investment risks. Now, as the European Banking Authority has acknowledged that ESG risks can potentially impact the economic and financial system, the debate on systemic risk has gained traction. Understanding the relationship between ESG merit and systemic risk is of utmost importance for the stability of the economic and financial system, still, research is limited. Relying on real-world European and United Stated data, we quantify systemic risk by means of QL-CoVaR. Empirical analyses of the entire period from 2007 to 2021 show that companies with high ESG scores tend to exhibit low QL-CoVaR values indicating a positive effect of ESG scores. Such evidence is confirmed by clustering the individual companies into ESG portfolios and focusing on COVID-19. Additional insights using the individual pillars are also provided. 2022 The Authors.

"Huang, W.; Lan, C.; Xu, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Zeng, H.",Does COVID-19 matter for systemic financial risks evidence from china's financial and real estate sectors,"The occurrence of global public safety incidents often affects systemic financial risk. Based on the event analysis method, this study provides a specific analysis of COVID-19's impact on China's financial systemic risks. Additionally, the study demonstrates the different features of systemic financial risk in different financial sectors (banking, securities, insurance) and real estate during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, first, COVID-19's influence on systemic financial risk in all sectors exhibits both level effect and trend effect, and the impact is particularly significant in branch sectors under real estate. Second, in the entire financial system, the securities and real estate sectors not only contribute more to the growth of systemic risk than the banking and insurance sectors but are also more persistent. Third, real estate, residential property, and park comprehensive industries with high debt, long cycles, and high financial dependence are less affected by COVID-19 on systemic financial risks than other industries. Fourth, in the transmission mechanism, COVID-19 impacts market liquidity, funding liquidity, and default risk in the financial sector and real estate sector however, the sources of systemic risk in different sectors differ. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,5,Pacific Basin Finance Journal,covid-19; systemic risk,"Huang, W.

Monetary policy affects banks’ vulnerability to systemic risk events and the likelihood of triggering such events, particularly among institutions connected via the contagion network. With a rising magnitude of interest rate shocks, the effect on systemic risk becomes non-linear, being driven more by contagion, especially under NIRP. The uniqueness of the impact of NIRP may be characterized as arising from the evolution of the structure and intensity of impulse transmission while leaving the structure of the monetary policy transmission mechanism unaffected. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,0,"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money",contagion effect; monetary policy; negative interest rates; network analysis; systemic risk,"Iwanicz-Drozdowska, M.

"Duan, Y.; Fan, X.; Wang, Y.",Economic policy uncertainty and bank systemic risk: A cross-country analysis,"We examine the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on systemic risk. We performed regression analysis of data obtained from a large sample of 889 listed banks in 20 countries using an OLS model with two-way fixed effects. Empirical evidence suggests that banks are likely to contribute more to systemic risk when EPU increases. Then, through two-stage regression, we find that this effect operates through the bank leverage risk and bank asset risk channels. Further analyses reveal that some formal bank regulations (e.g., the regulatory environment) and informal institutions (e.g., national culture) can moderate this effect. In addition, we investigate economic policy uncertainty spillovers among our sample countries to help us understand the systemic risk arising from the cross-border transmission of EPU. We find that approximately 50% of the economic policy uncertainty in the sample countries originates from other countries. Developed countries are net exporters of uncertainty, while developing countries are net importers. Therefore, it is necessary for all countries, especially developing countries, to take appropriate measures to address the spillover effects of economic policy uncertainty in other countries and the resulting systemic risk. 2022",2022,2022-01-01,0,Pacific Basin Finance Journal,banking; economic policy uncertainty; international; systemic risk,"Duan, Y.

Methods: A total of 1,063 eyes of 1,063 diabetic patients were enrolled. We conducted binary and multiple multivariate regressions to analyze the ocular and systemic risk factors of DR. Based on the presence of myopia and history of cataract surgery, we divided the cases into four subgroups, namely those with high myopia, with the history of cataract surgery, with both conditions, and with neither, then determined the correlation between the stages of DR and CKD in each subgroup.In the binary analysis, high myopia was identified as the protective factor for DR odds ratio (OR): 0.312 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.195 0.500,0.001whereas cataract surgery was one of the independent risk factors for DR OR: 2.818 (95% CI: 1.507 5.273),0.001With increased stages of DR, high myopia played an increasingly protective role mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), OR 0.461,0.004 moderate NPDR OR 0.217,0.003 severe NPDR, OR 0.221,0.008 proliferative DR (PDR), OR 0.125,0.001whereas cataract surgery became a stronger risk factor, especially in PDR (mild NPDR, OR 1.595,0.259 moderate NPDR, OR 3.955,0.005 severe NPDR, OR 6.836,0.001 PDR, OR 9.756,0.001). The correlation between the stages of DR and CKD in the group with neither high myopia nor cataract surgery history was the highest among all subgroups. Conclusion: High myopia was a protective factor, whereas cataract surgery is a risk factor for DR, and both factors showed stronger effects throughout the (natural disease) grading of DR. The stages of DR and CKD showed a higher correlation after adjustment of the ocular confounding factors.

"Zhu, B.; Deng, Y.; Lin, R.; Hu, X.; Chen, P.",Energy security: does systemic risk spillover matter evidence from china,"Considering the severity and frequency of energy risk event shocks, this paper examines whether energy security issue is related to the propagation of significant shocks within the energy system. Relevant researches fail to concern the impact of systemic risk spillovers across energy firms on energy security and its influence mechanisms. By employing a complex network for characterizing risk event shock propagation mechanisms among high-dimensional data, our study captures the transmission of systemic risk among 128 Chinese energy firms from January 2013 to June 2021. Furthermore, using a modified spatial panel model, we find that systemic risk spillovers significantly affect energy security, and the effects are particularly salient in 2015 2016 and under COVID-19. The diffusion of risk event shocks in the Chinese energy system causes a decline in energy production and energy investment, further influencing short- and long-term energy security, respectively. Compared to the energy investment channel during 2015 2016 volatile periods, the negative effect of the COVID-19 crisis on security issues relies more on the energy production channel. The also show a heterogeneous effect of individual energy firms' risk event shocks on energy security, and the influence of the systemic risk spillovers caused by state-owned firms' risk events is more significant than private firms. Overall, in dealing with frequent energy shocks, collaborations among energy firms, energy sectors, and the government are important for ensuring a country's energy security. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,3,Energy Economics,china; clustering algorithms; complex network; complex networks; energy; energy investments; energy productions; energy risks; energy security; energy systems; energy use; investments; network security; panel data; panel model; risk assessment; security issues; spatial analysis; spatial panel model; spillover effect; systemic risk spillover; systemic risks,"Zhu, B.

Our findings show how the interconnection between banks of different countries has an important influence on accumulated losses in the tail of the distribution. Likewise deterioration in the quality of bank portfolios produces a significant reduction in the fund's loss-absorbing capacity, which calls into question its soundness in times of economic recession.

"Can, U.; Bocuoglu, M.E.",Evolution of islamic liquidity management in turkey,"Purpose: There is not a comprehensive study which covers the evolution of the Turkish Islamic liquidity management landscape so far. The purpose of this study is to show how Turkish PBs have been gradually furnished with the needed liquidity management instruments by the Turkish Treasury, Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and other related regulatory bodies and to analyze the repercussions of the evolution of Islamic liquidity management on balance sheets of participation banks (PBs) over time. This study also aims to come up with some humble policy recommendations that can improve Islamic liquidity management set up going forward. Design methodology approach: The study acknowledges that at least two important elements of liquidity management should be in place on the way of improving the Islamic liquidity management environment. The first one is asset side liquidity or having an adequate amount of high-quality liquid assets. The second one is liability side liquidity, meaning that having access to funding liquidity, especially to central bank liquidity. Historical development of liquidity-related asset-side and liability-side balance sheet items between 2010 and 2020 are analyzed and visualized to demonstrate the progress in the Islamic liquidity management landscape in Turkey. Findings: From 2010 to 2020, Turkish financial authorities made a great effort to get PBs to have more proper liquidity management tools. Turkish authorities have leveled the playing field for PBs via enriching liquidity management tools. Government sukuk issuances has filled the liquid asset gap, improved the liquidity profile of PBs and lessened overall liquidity risk while introduced central bank liquidity facilitates have reduced funding liquidity risk. Islamic liquidity management setup is much more advanced and participation banking system is more resilient than the past, but there are still some missing steps that can further ameliorate the Islamic liquidity management ecosystem in Turkey. Research limitations implications: This study is a visualized ratio analysis of PB’s improving liquidity profile in the past 10 years and fills an important gap in terms of displaying the overall Islamic liquidity management landscape in Turkey. Further studies and analysis can be built on this paper on Islamic liquidity management, banking and finance in the future. This paper can be a useful basement for researchers who intend to study on potential impacts of improving the liquidity of PBs on monetary transmission, banking profitability and overall banking system systemic risks. Practical implications: Three different and interconnected areas should be further improved. These are enriching the diversity of government securities, providing central bank liquidity facilities under various available Islamic contracts and establishing an organized Islamic money market which will facilitate fund flows among various Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) and conventional financial institutions. Policymakers should act together, handle arising issues in a holistic manner, design and operationalize these incomplete parts of the puzzle to further optimize the playing field for the IFIs. Thus, there will be a more inclusive and competitive finance industry in which all risks are better managed and resources are more efficiently allocated. Originality value: Although various other studies are available on the Turkish Islamic banking industry, there is not such a specific study on Islamic liquidity management of Turkish PBs which makes this study a preliminary and different one. Apart from shedding light on the Turkish journey that has built a sound Islamic liquidity management infrastructure in the past 10 year, this study also shows an exemplary country experience in developing a more inclusive and robust financial ecosystem.

"Chaturvedi, A.; Singh, A.",Examining systemic risk using google pagerank algorithm: an application to indian non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) crisis,"In the recent financial crises, attention has shifted towards ""too-central-to-fail"" to recognize the sources of systemic risk. The NBFC Crisis of 2018-19 adversely affected other financial institutions and the real economy of India. The NBFCs crisis highlighted the role of smaller institutions in perpetuating and amplifying the crisis. Thus, the present study models the interconnection of NBFCs with the rest of financial institutions using a complex Granger-causality network based on returns data. The PageRank algorithm identifies the central and important nodes and ranks financial institutions in pre-crisis and crisis periods. The financial institutions are also ranked based on the maximum percentage loss suffered during the crises. Using non-parametric rank-based regression, the PageRank ranking of financial institutions in the pre-crises period (explanatory variable) is regressed with the ranking of financial institutions based on maximum percentage loss suffered by them during the crises period (dependent variable) along with Leverage and Size as control variables. We found that PageRank from pre-crisis can significantly identify most financial institutions that suffered loss during NBFCs crises even in the presence of control variables. 2022 International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.

This study uses financial distress as a moderating variable to examine the relationship between financial immunity and stock returns of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which have different characteristics. The research samples were companies listed on the Indonesia stock exchange and the Shanghai stock exchange with 767 and 736 observations, respectively, in 2016 2019. The first-stage test method uses balanced data panel regression to test individual interactions as a sufficient condition. Regression model specification of the response variable for the fixed effects model can overcome the common effects model limitations. The second stage is a matched test or Paired Samples T-Test for hypothesis testing after testing each individual interaction for each country. The of this study show that financial immunity has a positive effect on stock returns in two countries: Indonesia and China. Meanwhile, the financial distress of the US-China Trade War for Indonesia and Shanghai shows differentFinancial distress significantly reduces stock returns on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, while the distress does not affect stock returns on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

"Chiang, S.-H.; Chen, C.-F.",From systematic to systemic risk among g7 members: do the stock or real estate markets matter,"Stock and housing market systematic risk may be a critical ingredient in the precipitation of systemic risk and hence a financial crisis. However, surprisingly few studies have so far explored the role of their contagion in triggering systemic risk. In this paper, time-varying connectedness is used to measure two-market systematic risks and time-varying Granger-causality is employed to monitor their causal interactions over time. Using quarterly G7 data over a long period covering 1970 2021, our indicate that these systematic risks both are very volatile. Moreover, the dominant source of causality in the housing systematic risk implies that policies directed against the possibility of a housing bubble, for example, macroprudential toolkits, deserve special emphasis. Finally, given that the duration of the bilateral causality coincides with those in past crises, a dynamic probit model reveals that adopting an expansionary monetary policy with a huge reduction in interest rates may greatly increase the likelihood of a financial crisis. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,2,"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money",connectedness; g7 members; probit model; stock and housing markets; systematic risk; time-varying granger-causality,"Chiang, S.-H.

The interactions among banks include not only direct cross-holding, but also indirect dependency by holding mutual assets outside the banking system. Using data extracted from the European Banking Authority, we present the interdependency network composed of 48 banks and 21 asset classes. For the robustness, we employ three methods, called Anan, Ha a and Maxe, to reconstruct the asset liability cross-holding network. Then we combine the external portfolio holdings of each bank to compute the interdependency matrix. The interdependency network is much denser than the direct cross-holding network, showing the complex latent interaction among banks. Finally, we perform macroprudential stress tests for the European banking system, using the adverse scenario in EBA stress test as the initial shock. For different reconstructed networks, we illustrate the hierarchical cascades and show that the failure hierarchies are roughly the same except for a few banks, reflecting the overlapping portfolio holding accounts for the majority of defaults. We also calculate systemic vulnerability and individual vulnerability, which provide important information for supervision and relevant management actions. 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,2,Journal of Financial Stability,contagions; financial network; interdependent network; stress test; systemic risk,"Barnett, W.A.

"Bek, T.; Nielsen, M.S.; Klug, S.E.; Eriksen, J.E.",Increasing metabolic variability increases the risk for vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"Purpose: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can be treated by retinal photocoagulation, but in some cases, the treatment is initiated too late or is insufficient so that the disease advances to a stage requiring vitrectomy. There is a need to identify risk factors that can predict if patients with PDR will develop complications in need for vitrectomy. Methods: Survival analysis with death as competing risk was used to study systemic risk factors for PDR progression to a complication in need for vitrectomy in right eyes of all 1288 diabetic patients from the Aarhus area, Denmark, who had developed proliferative retinopathy in the right eye during the 25 years period fromJuly 1994 untilJuly 2019.The overall cumulative incidence of reaching a vitrectomy end point in the right eye was 24.1% (n 311). In 9.3% (n 120) of the patients where vitrectomy had been performed together with the first photocoagulation, the age of onset of diabetes was significantly higher (p 0.0001), the diabetes duration longer (p 0.035) and BMI higher (p 0.01) than in the patients who had been vitrectomized later than the first photocoagulation. The risk for vitrectomy was significantly increased by high variability of HbA1c before the development of PDR (p 0.0001), but not by other parameters known to increase the risk for developing PDR. Conclusion: Increasing variability of HbA1c before the development of PDR increases the risk for progression to a complication in need of vitrectomy. The need for vitrectomy is unaffected by other risk factors known to increase the risk for developing PDR. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2022,2022-01-01,1,International Ophthalmology,"adult; adverse event; article; body mass; controlled study; cumulative incidence; death; denmark; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; diabetic retinopathy; disease course; disease duration; disease exacerbation; female; hemoglobin a1c; human; humans; laser coagulation; light coagulation; major clinical study; male; metabolic regulation; onset age; photocoagulation; prediction; proliferative diabetic retinopathy; retina; risk factor; risk factors; survival analysis; vitrectomy; vitreoretinopathy; vitreoretinopathy, proliferative","Bek, T.

"Poudel, A.; Riga, E.; Pitilakis, K.",Investigation on the precision of local site conditions in the systemic risk assessment of utility systems at city scale,"Proper functioning of critical infrastructures and utility systems is crucial for an urban area to facilitate society. Concerning the seismic risk assessment of such systems, the interdependencies between the components of a system, as well as between different systems might have a strong impact on the estimated risk. During and after an extreme event like earthquakes, interdependencies between different critical infrastructures might lead to exacerbated impact. To ensure comprehensive planning for disaster risk mitigation, it is crucial to understand the interdependencies and the effect that they pose during and in the aftermath of the events. Also, it is well known that the local site conditions may significantly affect the structural response. Local site conditions may generally be represented in terms of average shear wave velocity up to 30 meters depth, Vs,30, because of its broad usage by the majority of the ground motion prediction equations, as well as seismic code provisions. When we consider critical infrastructures, due to the interdependencies the effect of the site conditions might not be limited to the single component structure but have cascading or propagating effects to other components and eventually to the other interconnected systems as well. In this study, we aim to investigate whether a more detailed knowledge of local site conditions in terms of Vs,30 affects the overall performance of utility systems at the urban scale, compared to a more simplified approach for estimation of Vs,30, commonly used for urban regional scale analysis, considering also the systemic approach. Specifically, the interdependencies between the water supply system and electric power network have been considered and the performance is measured in terms of water connectivity loss.

"Satya, K.S.R.; Bijoy, K.; Sahay, A.",Issues in liquidity management in banking system: an empirical evidence from indian commercial banks,"Maintaining the optimal level of liquidity in the banking system has always been a challenge for banks globally. Liquidity deficit Indian Banks turned to liquidity surplus due to the demonetization of higher denomination currencies in November 2016. The liquidity deficit has the potential to trigger systemic risk whereas a surplus can weaken monetary transmission leading to the creation of asset bubbles. This study explores the impact of various interventions of policymakers to maintain the optimal liquidity by simultaneously insulating the banks’ profitability and overall economic growth from the policy’s negative impact using Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) regression. The study records and analyses the impacts of Fiscal DeficitLending and Deposit Ratesand Credit Growth Rate on Liquidity Deficit, GDP growth and Banks’ Profitability levels. It is found that Fiscal deficit is negatively related to Liquidity deficit and GDP growth but increases Banks’ profit whereas Lending rates have an insignificant impact on Liquidity Deficit. Increasing Deposit rates have a positive impact on Liquidity deficit, negative on Banks’ Profit, and immediate positive relationships with GDP growth which changes to negative at the third lag. Similarly, the Credit growth rate has a positive relationship with the Liquidity deficit, augments GDP growth, and reduces Banks’ profit. It is also observed that the profit of Indian Scheduled Commercial banks has reduced after the demonetization. This study, apart from contributing to academic literature, will help the monetary authorities and the financial institutions in their policy decisions for managing the liquidity issues in the market. 2022 The Author(s).

"De, S.D.","Law, policy and climate change: the regulation of systemic risks","Focusing on systemic risks caused by climate change, this book examines how these risks can be effectively regulated to ensure resilience and avoid catastrophe. Systemic risks are risks that threaten the systems upon which society depends, including ecosystems, social systems, financial systems, and systems of infrastructure. Such risks are typically characterised by inherent complexity, profound uncertainty, and overwhelming ambiguity. In combination, these features pose significant regulatory challenges for policy and law-makers. Examining how different types of systemic risks caused by climate change are being regulated in four different jurisdictionsthe EU, the UK, the US and Australiathis book identifies deficiencies associated with regulating systemic risks using a traditional approach, based on a linear relationship between risk and regulation, which is widely used to regulate risk. The book advances a regulatory approach that is, instead, founded on the concept of ""risk governance"". This involves a structured yet flexible, holistic, interdisciplinary and inclusive basis for responding to systemic risks and it is, this book argues, a more effective basis for regulating systemic risks given their uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. This book will appeal to academics, policy and law-makers and practitioners working at the intersection of law and policy in the areas of regulation, risk management and climate change. 2023 Dariel De Sousa.

"Cevik, S.; Miryugin, F.",Leverage shocks: firm-level evidence on debt overhang and investment,"The global economy is in the midst of an unprecedented slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This systemic risk like no other at a time of record-breaking debt levels, especially among non-financial firms across the world, could exacerbate corporate vulnerabilities, deepen macro-financial instability, and cause long-lasting damage to economic potential. Using data on more than 3.7 million non-financial firms from 58 countries during the period 1997-2019, we develop a two-pronged approach to investigate the relationship between corporate leverage and fixed investment spending. The empirical analysis, robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, confirm corporate leverage is highly vulnerable to disruptions in profitability and cash flow at the firm level and economic growth at the aggregate level. These findings imply that corporate debt overhang could become a strenuous burden on non-financial firms, especially if the COVID-19 pandemic lingers and global downturn becomes protracted. 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin Boston.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Review of Economics,corporate debt; debt overhang; firm-level; fixed investment; leverage,"Cevik, S.

"Schmidt-Kessen, M.J.; Eenmaa, H.; Mitre, M.",Machines that make and keep promiseslessons for contract automation from algorithmic trading on financial markets,"An important part of the criticism raised against the adoption of advanced contract automation relates to the inflexibility of automated contracts. Drawing on rational choice theory, we explain why inflexibility, when seen as a constraint, can ultimately not only enhance welfare but also enable cooperation on algorithmic markets. This illuminates the need to address the inflexibility of contracting algorithms in a nuanced manner, distinguishing between inflexibility as a potentially beneficial constraint on the level of transactions, and inflexibility as a set of systemic risks and changes arising in markets employing inflexible contracting algorithms. Using algorithmic trading in financial markets as an example, we show how the automation of finance has brought about institutional changes in the form of new regulation to hedge against systemic risks from inflexibility. Analyzing the findings through the lens of new institutional economics, we explain how widespread adoption of contract automation can put pressure on institutions to change. We conclude with possible lessons that algorithmic finance can teach to markets deploying algorithmic contracting. 2022 Maria Jos Schmidt-Kessen, Helen Eenmaa, Maya Mitre",2022,2022-01-01,0,Computer Law and Security Review,algorithmic contract; algorithmic contracts; algorithmic trading; algorithmics; automation; commerce; computable contract; computable contracts; constrained maximization; constraint; constraints; contract law value; contract law values; contract laws; contracts; financial markets; inflexibility; new institutional economics; smart contracts,"Schmidt-Kessen, M.J.

The article observes the dynamic changes of the shock spillovers between systemic stress and the rest of the German economy. In that way, the net emitters and receivers of shocks are observed throughout time, as previous research found that systemic stress is not always the predictor of other economic activity. The analysis utilizes Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) spillover index approach within the vector autoregression model. One step further is taken as well, as the changes of dynamics are observed throughout the entire period. As the macroprudential and monetary policymakers have to track the interrelationships between these variables over time, the approach in the study is straightforward and easy to interpret.

An urban safety net hospital database was used for this cross-sectional observational study. Diabetic patients who underwent fundus photography and AL measurement between March 2017 and June 2020 were included. The fundus photographs were graded following the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. The study enrolled 1843 patients with diabetes (mean age: 56.9 12.1 years AL: 23.56 1.12 mm), including 931 men and 912 women. Male sex was a risk factor for diabetic retinopathy (P 0.001 odds ratio OR 1.5, 95% confidence interval CI 1.18 1.98). A higher DR prevalence was associated with shorter AL both in men (P 0.003 OR 0.77 95% CI 0.66 0.91) and women (P 0.02 OR 0.83 95% CI 0.71 0.97) after adjusting for systemic risk factors using multivariable logistic regression. There was no significant impact of sex on the relationship between AL and DR (P 0.56). In the subset of patients with asymmetric DR, the percentage of patients whose shorter eye had a higher stage of DR was not significantly different between men and women (P 0.20). Male sex is a risk factor for DR in a diverse safety-net hospital population.

"Moussa, A.; El-Dakhakhni, W.",Managing interdependence-induced systemic risks in infrastructure projects,"Complex by nature, infrastructure megaprojects rarely meet stakeholders' expectations. A key characteristic of such complexity is the interdependence among different project stakeholders (e.g., contractors) where disruption of one contractor's work may instigate (system-level) systemic risks, resulting in poor key performance indicators (KPIs) of the whole project. Attributed to the lack of appropriate analysis and quantification tools, managing the systemic risks resulting from such interdependence remains challenging. The current study fills this knowledge gap through proactive systemic risk management (i.e., early identification, analysis, mitigation, and continuous monitoring). The study enhanced and operationalized a previously developed conceptual framework, in which interdependence was quantified through employing complex network theoretic measures. Specifically, the current study correlated contractor interdependence to project KPIs in order to assess associated project systemic risks. Subsequently, a metaheuristic optimization technique was employed to reorganize the project's scheduleeffectively managing interdependence-induced risks. To demonstrate the utility of the developed methodology, a power infrastructure project was considered. Finally, the study provides valuable insights to improve the performance of complex infrastructure projects through proactive systemic risk management, ultimately enhancing the overall project's hyper resilience (i.e., to interdependence-induced disruptions). 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",2022,2022-01-01,1,Journal of Management in Engineering,'current; benchmarking; complex network theory; complex networks; contractors; hyper resilience; infrastructure; infrastructure project; interdependence; key performance indicator; key performance indicators; key performance indicators (kpis); risk assessment; risk management; risks management; systemic risks,"Moussa, A.

"Sun, L.-H.",Mean field games with heterogeneous groups: application to banking systems,"We study the system of heterogeneous lending and borrowing based on the relative average of log-capitalization given by the linear combination of the average within groups and ensemble average. Moreover, we describe the evolution of log-capitalization by using a system of coupled diffusions. The model incorporates a game feature with homogeneity within groups and heterogeneity among groups where banks search for the optimal strategies for lending to or borrowing from a central bank by minimizing the heterogeneous linear quadratic costs to avoid approaching the default barrier. The importance of relative concerns causes the relative ensemble average to be the critical determinant for lending and borrowing. The existence of closed- and open-loop Nash equilibria for the two-group case is validated by the solvability for the coupled Riccati equations. Both equilibria comprise the mean-reverting terms identical to the homogeneous game and all group averages owing to heterogeneity. The comparison of the obtained open- and closed-loop Nash equilibria is discussed. Furthermore, the existence of an approximate Nash equilibrium of the mean field games in the generalheterogeneous groups is verified. Finally, in financial implications, we study the influence of the incentive and relative parameters and also the number of banks on the corresponding liquidity rates through numerical analysis. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,2022-01-01,1,Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,banking systems; closed-loop; computation theory; ensemble averages; finance; game theory; heterogeneous group; inter-bank borrowing and lending system; mean field game; mean-field games; nash equilibria; nash equilibrium; open-loop; relative ensemble average; riccati equations; systemic risk; systemic risks,"Sun, L.-H.

It becomes equally important to study the relationship between commodity price variability and the stock market. Hence, this study aims to calculate the tail risk of highly traded Indian commodity futures returns using the conditional EVT-VaR method for risk measurement. Secondly, the linkage between commodity markets and the stock market is also studied using the Delta CoVaR method. highlight the following points. There is risk transfer from the extreme increase decrease in crude oil futures returns to the Nifty Index returns. Both extreme price increase or decrease of crude oil futures driven either by financial or a combination of financial and economic shocks affect the stock market. Zinc and Natural gas futures are not linked to the stock market, which means they can be useful in portfolio diversification. The findings suggest that, in Indian commodity markets, EVT-VaR is a useful tool for measuring risk. Only Crude oil futures shocks affect the stock market, and extreme integration between them becomes more prominent when oil shocks are driven by financial factors. Commodities other than Crude oil are not integrated with stock markets in India.

"Anwer, Z.; Khan, A.; Naeem, M.A.; Tiwari, A.K.",Modelling systemic risk of energy and non-energy commodity markets during the COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 led restrictions make it imperative to study how pandemic affects the systemic risk profile of global commodities network. Therefore, we investigate the systemic risk profile of global commodities network as represented by energy and nonenergy commodity markets (precious metals, industrial metals, and agriculture) in pre- and post-crisis period. We use neural network quantile regression approach of Keilbar and Wang (Empir Econ 62:1 26, 2021) using daily data for the period 01 January 2018 27 October 2021. The findings suggest that at the onset of COVID-19, the two firm-specific risk measures namely value at risk and conditional value of risk explode pointing to increasing systemic risk in COVID-19 period. The risk spillover network analysis reveals moderate to high lower tail connectedness of commodities within each sector and low tail connectedness of energy commodities with the other sectors for both pre- and post-COVID-19 periods. The Systemic Network Risk Index reveals an abrupt increase in systemic risk at the start of pandemic, followed by gradual stabilization. We rank commodities in terms of systemic fragility index and observe that in post COVID-19 period, gold, silver, copper, and zinc are the most fragile commodities while wheat and sugar are the least fragile commodities. We use Systemic Hazard Index to rank commodities with respect to their risk contribution to global commodities network. During post COVID-19 period, the energy commodities (except natural gas) contribute most to the systemic risk. Our study has important implications for policymakers and the investment industry. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,2022-01-01,6,Annals of Operations Research,commodities; covar; covid-19; energy; neural network quantile regression,"Anwer, Z.

"Purificato, F.; Sapienza, E.",Monetary policy and financial stability in the economic and monetary union,"Following the financial crisis, a new theoretical framework in which monetary policy aims at price stability and macro-prudential policy at financial stability is presented. In 2014, the European institutions established the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) to pursue the of financial stability. The new institutional arrangement contemplates a micro-prudential policy under the direct control of the European central bank (ECB), a macro-prudential policy under the responsibility of National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and the supervision of the ECB. The chapter presents a survey and a simple analytical model to assess this new institutional design. Despite a still incomplete reform process, as the decision-making process lacks total transparency and the regulatory field is not levelled, the survey supports the view that the SSM promotes financial stability in the Euro area. According to the model presented, the new institutional framework is positively assessed: an increase in the efficiency of prudential policies to face financial risks allows the ECB to pursue the of financial stability without compromising output stability. As highlighted by Carlo Panico, this occurred in the Mexican economy, where the process of financial liberalisation promoted a rise in systemic risk, and the monetary policy aimed at financial stability generated lower growth. 2023 selection and editorial matter, John Eatwell, Pasquale Commendatore and Neri Salvadori individual chapters, the contributors.",2022,2022-01-01,0,"Classical Economics, Keynes and Money: Essays in Honour of Carlo Panico",,"Purificato, F.

"Guo, C.; Wu, J.; Song, Q.",Multi-channel formation mechanism and measurement of banking systemic risk,"This paper investigates a multi-channel formation mechanism of systemic risk under the superposition of insolvency and liquidity exhaustion, in which debt defaults, liquidity runs and fire sales penetrate and strengthen each other. The paper dynamically simulates the evolution process of risk contagion under the impact of real estate loan defaults, and carries out an empirical analysis on 38 banks from 2012 to 2020. It’s found that the banking system can fully absorb the initial impact of real estate loan defaults, and systemic risks mainly generate in the process of multi-channel risk contagion caused by bank deleveraging. Fire sales have significant impacts on the formation of systemic risk, while the impacts of inter-bank market debt defaults and liquidity runs are limited. Insolvency and liquidity exhaustion are the main forms of risk contagion, and the superposition effects continue to amplify systemic risk. Liquidity exhaustion is more serious, but it has been significantly improved, while insolvency becomes more prominent year by year. The release of systemic risk has immediate effect under severe impact, continuityeffect under moderate impact, and self-recovery under mild impact. The types of risks in the banking system tend to be complicated. State-owned commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks are more prone to the dual risks of liquidity exhaustion and insolvency, and vulnerability and risk contribution are more prominent. Urban commercial banks and rural commercial banks mostly show double risks or single risk. Based on the researchthe paper provides feasible policy suggestions for China’s banking systemic risk prevention and financial supervision. 2022, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

The show that bearish market conditions enlarge low-frequency systemic risk spillovers in commodity markets, and bullish market conditions have more striking impacts on high-frequency systemic risk spillovers. Furthermore, the center of risk spillover networks varies across the market conditions and frequencies. Specifically, at the high-frequency level, sugar is the largest risk transmitter in bad regimes, and heating oil is in the center of the network in good regimes. At the intermediate frequency level, soybean becomes a more important risk transmitter in both regimes. In other cases, heating oil is the center of risk spillover networks. 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022,2022-01-01,6,North American Journal of Economics and Finance,commodity market; covar; spillover network; stvar; wavelet packet decomposition,"Zhang, X.

The grave and devastating impacts of the current COVID-19 call for the need to assess the state of global and national preparedness for future pandemics. This chapter provides an outline of Sri Lanka's response to the COVID-19 pandemic while delving into the current status and gaps concerning preparedness for pandemics in the country. The analysis is aimed at providing key recommendations for policymakers to improve national-level preparedness for anticipated pandemic threats. This chapter has drawn on a review of secondary literature and primary data gathered through in-depth interviews conducted with key informants in the disaster management and public health sectors in the country. Findings show that while preparedness planning for biological hazards is predominantly a responsibility of the health sector in the country, there is a pressing need to strengthen such preparedness through a unified legal framework and system of governance that allow for the transfer of relevant expertise, infrastructure, and lessons learned from previous hazards contexts to situations of pandemics the incorporation of pandemic preparedness into national-level DRR efforts and subnational-level DRR planning intensifying national focus on building economic and social resilience emulating a multisectoral approach, enhancing private sector participation, and establishing a national framework to foster preparedness for parallel hazards. 2022 Elsevier Inc.

As modern financial markets are highly interconnected and complex networks, their network resilience is an important indicator of the ability of the financial system to prevent risks. To provide a comprehensive perspective on the network resilience of financial networks, we review the main advances in the literature on network resilience and financial networks. Further, we review the key elements and applications of financial network resilience processing in financial regulation, including financial network information, network resilience measures, financial regulatory technologies, and regulatory applications. Finally, we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions from the perspective of resilience-based financial systemic risk regulation. 2022 The Author(s).

"Kim, Y.S.; Pence, K.; Stanton, R.; Walden, J.; Wallace, N.",Nonbanks and mortgage securitization,"This article reviews the dramatic growth of nonbank mortgage lending after the Global Financial Crisis, especially to borrowers with lower credit scores, and the related importance of mortgage-backed securitization. Our literature review suggests that the existing theoretical and empirical work on securitization is more relevant to bank than to nonbank lenders, thus leaving outstanding questions as to why nonbank market shares have increased to their current levels and how best to structure nonbank oversight. To highlight key differences in the mortgage-lending incentives of banks and nonbanks, we build a simple theoretical model of bank versus nonbank mortgage lending and use it to generate and test empirical hypotheses. We find, in particular, that loans issued by nonbanks are more likely to prepay early than loans issued by banks, the difference not explainable by nonbank borrowers prepaying more rationally. Using regulatory filings from nonbanks that are typically unavailable to academic researchers, we examine the balance sheets and liquidity and capital positions of large Ginnie Mae nonbank servicers, which face and pose more risk in the current mortgage system. We find that on average these servicers have reasonable liquidity and capital positions relative to standard regulatory thresholds, particularly in 2022:Q1 after a few quarters of elevated profits. However, some large Ginnie Mae servicers appear to have inadequate capital, as gauged by risk-based capital measures. If defaults rise on a large scale, the liquidity and capital positions of these servicers may amplify the disruption in the mortgage and housing markets. 2022 Annual Reviews Inc..

"Babaioff, M.; Kolumbus, Y.; Winter, E.",Optimal collaterals in multi-enterprise investment networks,"We study a market of investments on networks, where each agent (vertex) can invest in any enterprise linked to her, and at the same time, raise capital for her firm's enterprise from other agents she is linked to. Failing to raise sufficient capital with the firm defaulting, being unable to invest in others. Our main is to examine the role of collateral contracts in handling the strategic risk that can propagate to a systemic risk throughout the network in a cascade of defaults. We take a mechanism-design approach and solve for the optimal scheme of collateral contracts that capital raisers offer their investors. These contracts aim at sustaining the efficient level of investment as a unique Nash equilibrium, while minimizing the total collateral. Our main contrast the network environment with its non-network counterpart (where the sets of investors and capital raisers are disjoint). We show that for acyclic investment networks, the network environment does not necessitate any additional collaterals, and systemic risk can be fully handled by optimal bilateral collateral contracts between capital raisers and their investors. This is, unfortunately, not the case for cyclic investment networks. We show that bilateral contracting will not suffice to resolve systemic risk, and the market will need an external entity to design a global collateral scheme for all capital raisers. Furthermore, the minimum total collateral that will sustain the efficient level of investment as a unique equilibrium may be arbitrarily higher, even in simple cyclic investment networks, compared with the corresponding non-network environment. Additionally, we prove computational-complexityboth for a single enterprise and for networks. 2022 ACM.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Www 2022 - Proceedings of the Acm Web Conference 2022,bilateral contracting; commerce; design approaches; financial networks; investment; investments; machine design; mechanism design; nash equilibria; network environments; optimal scheme; simple++; strategic risk; strategic risks; systemic risks,"Babaioff, M.

"Zevelev, A.A.","Regulating mortgage leverage: fire sales, foreclosure spirals, and pecuniary externalities","This paper introduces a dynamic general equilibrium model to study how the distribution of leverage and foreclosure affect house prices. In the model, exogenous income shocks drive endogenous foreclosure and equilibrium house prices. The model shows how foreclosure sales, through their effect on housing supply, amplify and propagate house price drops. A calibration shows consumption and housing need to be sufficiently complementary to fit the data. Since leverage plays a key role in foreclosure, a regulator can reduce systemic risk by placing a cap on leverage. Counterfactual experiments show that in a world with less leverage, the same economic shock leads to less foreclosure and less severe, shorter busts in house prices. 2022 American Real Estate Society.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Journal of Real Estate Research,default; foreclosure; housing; leverage; macro-prudential policy; mortgage,"Zevelev, A.A.

First, we analyze the risk of RMB internationalization and its transmission mechanism from the perspective of the economic characteristics of neighboring countries and trading partner countries. Second, we use the FASP index system construction method for reference to construct a forecast index system for macro- and microrisks brought about by RMB internationalization. Then, the weight of each index is determined through index common degree analysis and principal component analysis, and the risk of RMB internationalization is divided. On this basis, the risks of RMB internationalization in China from 2000 to 2019 are divided into four categories. Based on the BP neural network algorithm optimized by the simulated degradation algorithm, the PCA-SA-BPNN model of RMB internationalization risk forecast is constructed. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by experimental verification, and the risk status of RMB internationalization in 2020 is simulated and predicted. The research show that the risk status of RMB internationalization in 2020 is basically safe, and the risks of RMB internationalization mainly come from macroeconomic growth risks and systemic risks of the financial system. 2022 Shili Hu and Jie Du.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"algorithm; algorithms; annealing algorithm; bp neural networks; china; combine principal; economics; forecast models; forecasting; indices systems; internationalisation; neural networks; neural networks, computer; principal component analysis; principal-component analysis; risk assessment; risk forecasts; risk predictions; risks assessments; simulated annealing","Hu, S.

"Andrieş, A.M.; Ongena, S.; Sprincean, N.; Tunaru, R.",Risk spillovers and interconnectedness between systemically important institutions,"In this paper, we gauge the degree of interconnectedness and quantify the linkages between global and other systemically important institutions, and the global financial system. We document that the two groups and the financial system become more interconnected during the global financial crisis when linkages across groups grow. In contrast, during tranquil times linkages within groups prevail. Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) contribute most to system-wide distress but are also most exposed. There are more links coming from G-SIBs to other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) than the other way around, confirming the role of G-SIBs as major risk transmitters in the financial system. The two groups and the global financial system tend to co-vary for periods up to 60 days Prior to their official designation as G-SIBs or O-SIIs, the prevalent news sentiment about these institutions (we measure with a textual analysis) was negative. Importantly, the systemic importance and exposure of G-SIBs and O-SIIs is perceived differently by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). 2021",2022,2022-01-01,7,Journal of Financial Stability,bank networks; bayesian graphical var; interconnectedness; systemic risk; textual analysis,"Andrieş, A.M.

The secondary was to identify other contributory ischemic factors. Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study from a tertiary eye hospital in patients who underwent full-day diurnal variation of tension (DVT). Blood pressure (BP) and IOP measurements were done everyh over 24 h. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and MOPP were calculated. The nocturnal dip in BP was assessed patients were classified as non-dippers, dippers, and over-dippers. The circadian MOPP fluctuation (CMF) was calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and its relationship with type and severity of visual field was assessed.In total, 149 patients were evaluated 109 were classified as NTG, and 40 were classified as POAG. A nocturnal dip in BP was noted in 20% of NTG and 17.5% of POAG. The MAP was found to be lower in patients with NTG than POAG. In the NTG subgroup, we found that 20% of patients were over-dippers, 32% were dippers, and 48% were non-dippers. The CMF showed a greater fluctuation for over-dippers (P 0.004 for the RE and 0.003 for the LE) than dippers and non-dippers. A weak positive correlation of CMF with the severity of fields was found. Conclusion: A 24-h monitoring of IOP, BP, MOPP, and assessment of systemic risk factors for primary glaucoma acts as an invaluable tool for the comprehensive management of NTG despite the limitations posed by DVT and BP recording. 2022 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology.",2022,2022-01-01,2,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,"adverse event; blood pressure; carotid artery disease in ntg; circadian rhythm; cross-sectional studies; cross-sectional study; diurnal variation of iop; glaucoma, open-angle; human; humans; intraocular pressure; ischemia in glaucoma; low tension glaucoma; mean ocular perfusion pressure; normal-tension glaucoma; oculoplethysmography; open angle glaucoma; physiology; tonometry, ocular","Dinakaran, S.

We construct the price volatility network of the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index components in China's stock market in the period 2007 2020. We select three representative major emergencies: the global financial crisis in 2008, the stock disaster in 2015, and the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. First, we find that when the stock market is impacted by the major events, the network shows a cluster phenomenon. The cluster effect of the financial crisis events is smallest, while that of the epidemic events occurs most rapidly. Second, the key nodes in the stock market network have greater risk transmission ability. The manufacturing plays a crucial role during the later stages of events, while the financial industry plays an important role during the epidemic's recovery period. Third, the network structure of the stock market has an indicator effect on the systemic risk contributions. Generally, the greater a stock's eigenvector centrality, the greater its systemic risk contribution, while its closeness centrality and clustering coefficient have opposite effects.

Due to uncontrolled intraocular pressure even after maximum medical therapy, trabeculectomy with mitomycinwas planned. Preoperative intracameral bevacizumab was given to avoid intraoperative bleeding. Postinjection, localized SCH was noted, which settled spontaneously on conservative management. A combination of ocular and systemic risk factors, such as arteriosclerosis and idiopathic elevated episcleral venous pressure accentuated by intraoperative hypotony during intracameral injection, led to SCH.

"Kulikova, E.Yu.; Potapova, E.V.",Synthesis of managerial decisions to the effect of underground construction safety,"Safety of underground space development is ensured by the criterion analysis-based selection of managerial decisions on minimization of geotechnical and other risks. The criterion analysis can be the basis for the synthesis of managerial decisions to the effect of underground safety. The synthesis is implemented using decision making theory which includes conceptual, conceptual-executive and tactical levels. The first and the second levels represent the concept and the main strategies of minimization of the worst-case situation possibility. The tactical level expects elaboration of literate managerial decisions on actions plans aimed at minimization of geotechnical risks. Aimed at elimination of a hazardous event in underground construction, the concept of managerial decision selection should be based on synthesis of formalized informational and analytical problems on avoidance of an off-optimum situation owing to an alternative decision. The alternative decision criterion may be either the quantitative characteristic of undertaken safety provisions in underground construction, i.e. efficiency of safety measures, or the systemic risk level determination including all adverse geotechnical, ecological, organizational, social and economic factors in the nature-and-technology system represented by the rocks mass-technology-underground structure-environment integration, or the utility function of a managerial decision. Regarding the safety provision, it is critical to support the off-optimum situation valuation in underground construction by intelligent information-based reasoning. 2022 Publishing house Mining book.

The analysis is based on the data of 37 listed Indian banks in the Bombay Stock Exchange over a period of 10 years. Over the years Indian public sector banks were found to be top systemic risk emitters. In line with the international literature, bank size has emerged as a factor explaining the risk along with the share of short-term deposits, equity return, and return on assets. Share of the non-performing loan has surfaced as a new variable. While contributing to the Indian literature, the findings are expected to support the banking regulator to focus more on managing the current massive scale of poor-quality loan assets.

"Cui, X.; Yang, L.",Systemic risk and idiosyncratic networks among global systemically important banks,"In this article, we investigate the role played by idiosyncratic networks in systemic risk transmission among global systemically important banks. To construct idiosyncratic networks, we employ the conditional Granger causality approach and find they are unstable in the short term and stable in the long term. Additionally, we visualise dynamic idiosyncratic networks and confirm that their evolutionary pattern is similar to that of systemic risk. Moreover, we further explore systemic risk and idiosyncratic networks at an individual level and determine that in-degree and in-strength measures negatively influence systemic risk. This indicates that a well-connected idiosyncratic network in the banking system is prone to risk spillover and cause idiosyncratic contagion. The of the network analysis indicate that global banking idiosyncratic networks are a complex system and can serve as a valuable reference for investors and policymakers. 2022 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",2022,2022-01-01,1,International Journal of Finance and Economics,conditional granger causality; idiosyncratic contagion; network analysis; risk spillover; systemic risk,"Cui, X.

"Mwamba, J.W.M.; Angaman, S.",Systemic risk and real economic activity a south african insurance stress index of systemic risk,"This study investigates the link between systemic risk in the South African insurance sector real economic activity in South Africa. To this end, we use six systemic risk measures, the Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR), the Marginal Conditional Value at Risk (ΔCoVaR), the Comovement and Interconnectedness of the South African insurance sector (Eigen), the Dynamic Mixture Copula Marginal Expected Shortfall (DMC-MES), the Average Conditional Volatility (Ave-vol), and the South African Volatility Index (SAVI). We first evaluate the significance of each measure by assessing its ability to forecast future economic downturns in South Africa. We find that only two systemic risk measures possess the ability to predict future economic downturns in South Africa. We then use principal component quantile regression analysis to aggregate these measures into a composite stress index of systemic risk for the South African insurance sector and assess the ability of the proposed index to predict future economic downturns in South Africa. Our reveal that the proposed index is a good predictor of future economic downturns in South Africa. Thus, our suggest that regulators and risk managers must develop an analysis of systemic risk in the insurance sector with particular attention to its effects on real economic activity. In addition, our index can potentially be used as an instrument to monitor and mitigate systemic risk in the insurance sector in order to ensure the stability of the financial system and the economy in South Africa. 2022, Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia.

These developments have yielded various significant benefits, such as increased efficiency and robustness. However, we argue that they have also caused new interdependencies and complexity with a corresponding increase in associated systemic risks, e.g., local failures may spread faster and more extensively throughout the system. In this paper, we illustrate how systemic risks may arise in European electricity systems by discussing three exemplary developments. We also discuss the decisive role of the digital transformation that, on the one hand, speeds up the transition of electricity systems and challenges electricity systems’ stability through rapid change, but on the other hand may also provide solutions to tackle systemic risks. We argue that, especially in a strongly interconnected world, policymakers must implement a global perspective on these critical and increasingly complex systems, requiring adequate cooperation with respect to data. Using an exemplary case from Germany, we finally illustrate how an intensified data exchange may help to address systemic risks.

"Kumar, P.; Singh, V.K.",Systemic spillover dynamics of crude oil with indian financial indicators in post WPI revision and COVID era,"The study first investigates the sensitivity of major Indian financial indicators, viz. Equity Index (Nifty), Exchange Rate (USDINR), Bond (Govt 10Y Bond), Gold, Agricultural Index (N-Krishi) to ascertain the existence of significant sensitivity to standard shocks Engle and Campos-Martins (2020) either arising due to global political economic factor or endogenous macroeconomic scenario. After that, the study undertakes the systemic spillover dynamics of Crude by estimating a self-exciting regime-switching Threshold Vector Auto-regression model based on cut-off values of Crude to test shock transmission from Crude amid major global events empirically. The findings indicate the existence of three regimes with threshold cut-offs for Crude return, viz. 2.358% and 2.294% for 2008 and 2020, respectively. After that Spillover Index is estimated across the three regimes. The findings indicate a sporadic increase in spillover during the Covid era, GFC and Oil Crisis. Despite Govt. Bond ranking high insensitivity, the spillover linkage is low. The also indicate that, on average, systemic volatility shocks from crude oil are highest in Gold. In fact, Gold's sensitivity to crude price fluctuations escalates to new heights during the 2008 09 crisis, thus serving as a source of idiosyncratic shocks. Moreover, in recent duration, a unique see-saw kind of link has emerged between crude oil and Gold, where downward pressure by Crude on USDINR is eased by a fall in gold imports. Moreover, an analysis of the spillover pattern across the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) 2012 shows an intensification of spillover from Crude.

"Sigmund, M.",The capital buffer calibration for other systemically important institutions-is the country heterogeneity in the EU caused by regulatory capture,"In this article, we discuss how the too-big-to-fail dilemma for large financial institution is addressed in the regulatory framework and how (differently) regulators in the EU apply it. The European Banking Authority (EBA) has devised a buffer guideline for identifying other systemically important institutions (OSIIs) to address this issue. This guideline defines how to identify OSIIs by a scoring process but does not specify how to map these scores into additional capital buffers. In this study, we empirically show that the OSII buffer assignment is very heterogeneous in Europe. First, based on all EU banks that were classified as OSIIs, we show that the OSII score has less impact on the OSII buffer than the headquarter country dummy. Second, if all countries applied the German OSII buffer assignment, the additional capital requirements in the euro area would increase by 90 bn EUR. Third, we analyze whether our could be explained by regulatory capture which is measured by supervisory quality, supervisory funding, importance concentration of the banking system, and political orientation of the government. We find among others that supervisory quality and supervisory funding without banks' participation increase OSII buffers significantly. 2021 Scottish Economic Society.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Scottish Journal of Political Economy,banking; capital flow; europe; european union; financial market; financial stability; financial system; heterogeneity; institutional framework; macroprudential policy; other systemically important institutions; regulatory approach; regulatory capture; systemic risk,"Sigmund, M.

We also conduct some stability analysis by evaluating the impact of crisis sub-periods. We find that systemic risk increases in the Size of large financial institutions, particularly shadow entities, while it is insensitive to the Size of real estate finance services.

CAS is a consequence of systemic atherosclerotic disease affecting the majority of the aging population. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel imaging technique for visualizing retinal blood flow. It is a noninvasive, fast method for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the microcirculation. Cerebral and retinal circulation share similar anatomy, physiology, and embryology thus, retinal microvasculature provides a unique opportunity to study the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease in vivo. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of systemic risk factors on retinal blood flow in the eyes of patients with significant carotid artery stenosis using OCT angiography. A total of 112 eyes of 56 patients with significant carotid stenosis were included in the study. We found that several systemic factors, such as decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hypertension, and carotid occlusion have a significant negative effect on retinal blood flow, while statin use and carotid surgery substantially improve ocular microcirculation. Neither diabetes, clopidogrel or acetylsalicylic acid use, BMI, serum lipid level, nor thrombocyte count showed a significant effect on ocular blood flow. Our demonstrate that a systematic connection does exist between certain systemic risk factors and retinal blood flow in this patient population. OCTA could help in the assessment of cerebral circulation of patients with CAS due to its ability to detect subtle changes in retinal microcirculation that is considered to represent changes in intracranial blood flow. 2021, The Author(s).",2022,2022-01-01,2,Geroscience,"acetylsalicylic acid; adult; aged; angiography; article; body mass; brain microcirculation; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery stenosis; carotid artery surgery; carotid stenosis; cholesterol; clopidogrel; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic imaging; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; high density lipoprotein; human; humans; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase inhibitor; hypertension; lipid; lipid blood level; low density lipoprotein; major clinical study; male; microcirculation; oct angiography; optical coherence tomography; optical coherence tomography angiography; platelet count; procedures; prospective study; retina; retina blood flow; retinal biomarkers; retinal imaging; risk assessment; risk factor; tomography, optical coherence; triacylglycerol","István, L.

"Basdekis, C.; Christopoulos, A.; Katsampoxakis, I.; Nastas, V.",The impact of the ukrainian war on stock and energy markets: A wavelet coherence analysis,"This study attempts to examine the existence of interdependencies between specific stock market indices, exchange rates and crude oil for the period January 2021 to July 2022 with daily data. In the period we have chosen, the post-vaccination phase against COVID-19, as well as the war in Ukraine, is covered. The variables selected for this study are RTSI, Eurostoxx,P 500, EUR USD and RUB USD exchange rates and crude oil prices. The selection of the specific variables was made because they are directly related to the pre-war period that coincides with the post-vaccine period of the pandemic, which allowed us to characterize it as the normal period and to characterize the period of the war in Ukraine that coincides with the energy crisis as the unstable period. In this way, the present study covers the markets of Russia and other developed economies. For empirical purposes, we applied a wavelet coherence approach in order to investigate the possible existence of simultaneous coherence between the variables at different times and scales for all the considered times. The findings of the study reveal the existence of strong correlations between all variables, during different time periods and for different frequencies during the period under review. Of particular interest is the finding that shows that during the crisis period, the RTSI significantly affects both the European and American stock markets, while also determining the evolution of the Russian currency. In addition, it appears that capital constraints in the Russian stock market, combined with increased demand for crude oil, determine the interdependence between RTSI and crude oil. Finally, an interesting finding of the study is the existence of a negative correlation between the US stock index and crude oil in low-frequency bands and the RTSI and Eurostoxx with crude oil for the post-vaccination and pre-war periods in the medium term. These findings can be used by both investors and portfolio managers to hedge risks and make more confident investment decisions. In addition, these findings can be used by policy makers in the planning of regulatory policies regarding the limitations of the systemic risks in capital markets. 2022 by the authors.",2022,2022-01-01,4,Energies,coherence analysis; commerce; crude oil; crude oil prices; daily datum; energy crisis; energy markets; energy policy; energy security; exchange rates; financial markets; investments; russo-ukrainian war; stock market; stock market index; ukraine; vaccines; wavelet analysis; wavelet coherence; wavelet coherences,"Basdekis, C.

In this context, the identification of Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) is crucial, as it enables supervisors to spot potential sources of systemic risks at the global level and take mitigation actions. To this end, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), has built a methodology to identify G-SIBs. In this research, we employ a sample of banks over the years 2013 2018 and extend the FSB BCBS methodology through the application of an outranking multicriteria decision aiding approach, combined with extensive sensitivity analysis based on simulations with respect to the criteria weights and the sample composition. Different schemes for aggregating the simulation are examined in terms of their robustness. Moreover, we examine the relationship between the multicriteria evaluation for the global systemic importance of banks and their risk of failure. The reveal that systemic importance is positively associated with their probability of default, thus indicating that additional special measures should be designed and implemented for monitoring the soundness of banks that have a major role in the global financial system.

"Feinstein, Z.; Rudloff, B.",Time consistency for scalar multivariate risk measures,"In this paper we present on dynamic multivariate scalar risk measures, which arise in markets with transaction costs and systemic risk. Dual representations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to obtain the main of this paper on time consistency namely, an equivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to multiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of multivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets with transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal (1995),hne and Rudloff (2014), Roux and Zastawniak (2016)) does not satisfy the usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in (Feinstein and Rudloff (2021)), scalar risk measures with the same scalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The deduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time consistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires consideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a direct notion of a ""moving scalarization""for scalar time consistency that corroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi- problems (Karnam, Ma and Zhang (2017), Kov ov and Rudloff (2021)). 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin Boston.",2022,2022-01-01,1,Statistics and Risk Modeling,dynamic risk measures; scalarizations; set-valued risk measures; time consistency,"Feinstein, Z.

"Camponeschi, C.",Toward integrative resilience: a healing justice and trauma-informed approach to urban climate planning,"Cities are on the frontline of the climate crisis and, as such, are poised to experience more frequent and severe climate-related disruptions including heat waves, floods, and epidemics. The personal and societal costs of these threats will only escalate as the effects of climate change continue to be felt more acutely, yet municipal action plans currently lack comprehensive indicators for tracking their impact on human health and wellbeing. In response to this gap, this paper proposes an integrative approach to urban resilience that is premised on: 1) a bioecological reading of vulnerability 2) a trauma-informed approach to climate planning and 3) a healing justice’ orientation to policymaking. Informed by the cases of New York City and Copenhagen, it offers theoretical and policy contributions not only to the process of building resilience to climate change in cities, but to many other contexts where disaster and health emergencies, systemic risk mitigation, and community empowerment are concerned. 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2022,2022-01-01,1,Cities and Health,climate change; healing justice; mental health; trauma; urban resilience; vulnerability,"Camponeschi, C.

"Shipunova, O.; Berezovskaya, I.; Efremenko, O.",Transport risk factors and personal potential safe behavior of the railway operator,"The relevance of the study of risk factors causing accidents with a threat to human life on high-speed railways is determined by the increasing traffic intensity. Problems of ensuring safe traffic include the accounting and prediction of systemic risk factors determined by the relationship of different levels of interactions. The analysis of the basic personal qualities necessary for a person in difficult professional situations is associated with the structure of motivation for sustainable responsible behavior in extreme conditions on railway transport. The article's purpose is to show a multi-level systemic connection of risk factors in correlation with the analysis of the specifics of personal strategies of the operator's behavior and to identify effective models of behavior that characterize the ability to make conscious decisions in a problem situation. To this end, an empirical study of indicators of adaptability and stress resistance of transport university students was conducted. To achieve this goal, a multi-level personality questionnaire for overcoming stressful situations was used. The generalization of respondent survey data made it possible to identify models of operator-safe social behavior in an extreme situation through a tendency to implement a specific coping strategy. In conclusion, it is emphasized that ensuring safety in the high-speed traffic system depends on eliminating the risks that are caused by three vectors: the organization of the traffic system, the organization of social interaction systems, and personal self-organization associated with the individual characteristics of the operator adaptive potential. 2022 Elsevier B.V..

The individual systemic risk measurement has a certain scope of application and application conditions and, therefore, it is difficult for the individual indicator to reflect the systemic risk comprehensively. In this paper, the systemic risk is divided into four types: institution-specific risk, comovement and contagion, financial vulnerability, liquidity and credit. Next, the optimal combination is selected from multiple individual systemic risk indicators through dominance analysis to forecast the macroeconomic performance. The macroeconomic performance selects consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), industrial growth value (IVA), growth rate of broad money supply (M2) and gross domestic product (GDP) as proxies to compare the forecast effect of systemic risk, with the period considered spans from 2003M4 to 2022M7.

"Iyer, K.V.; Ravi, K.V.V.",Using blockchain technology in credit rating industry to promote an innovative bond-pays model,"Purpose: This paper aims to propose an innovative blockchain-based system enabling implementation of a bond-pays model in credit rating industry. Issuer-pays model has led to conflict of interest resulting in rating shopping and inflation. Alternative business models have their own problems, e.g. investor-pays model suffers from free rider and public dissemination challenges, whereas government-controlled business models can lead to market distortion. Bond-pays model has been difficult to implement owing to operational difficulties in managing co-ordination amongst multiple entities involved, often with conflicting goals. Blockchain technology enables inter-organizational systems that foster trust amongst non-trusting entities, facilitating business functions such as credit rating to be carried out. Design methodology approach: This paper outlines current processes in credit rating business that has led to repeated rating failures and proposes a new set of processes, leveraging capabilities of blockchain technology to enable implementation of an arms-length bond-pays model. Findings: A proof-of-concept system, namely, rating chain has been designed to implement a small part of the proposed model to establish technical feasibility in a blockchain environment. Practical implications: A fully functional blockchain-based system on bond-pays business model, if built and adopted, could impact how credit rating market functions currently and could contribute to a reduction in rating-related challenges.

The question of how risk managers can more accurately predict the evolution of their portfolio, while taking into consideration systemic risks brought on by a systemic crisis, is raised by the low rate of success of portfolio risk-management models. Sentiment analysis on natural language sentences can increase the accuracy of market prediction because financial markets are influenced by investor sentiments. Many investors also base their decisions on information taken from newspapers or on their instincts.

We aim to accomplish this by comparing the and accuracy of two cases of market prediction using regression models with and without market news sentiment analysis.

"Larson, H.J.; Lin, L.; Goble, R.",Vaccines and the social amplification of risk,"In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) named Vaccine Hesitancy one of the top 10 threats to global health. Shortly afterward, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as the world's predominant health concern. COVID-19 vaccines of several types have been developed, tested, and partially deployed with remarkable speed vaccines are now the primary control measure and hope for a return to normalcy. However, hesitancy concerning these vaccines, along with resistance to masking and other control measures, remains a substantial obstacle. The previous waves of vaccine hesitancy that led to the WHO threat designation, together with recent COVID-19 experience, provide a window for viewing new forms of social amplification of risk (SAR). Not surprisingly, vaccines provide fertile ground for questions, anxieties, concerns, and rumors. These appear in new globalized hyperconnected communications landscapes and in the context of complex human (social, economic, and political) systems that exhibit evolving concerns about vaccines and authorities. We look at drivers, impacts, and implications for vaccine initiatives in several recent historical examples and in the current efforts with COVID-19 vaccination. Findings and insights were drawn from the Vaccine Confidence Project's decade long monitoring of media and social media and its related research efforts.

"Mieg, H.A.",Volatility as a transmitter of systemic risk: is there a structural risk in finance,"This article discusses the role of volatility in the context of systemic risk in finance. The main argument is that volatility transmits risks within the financial system and beyond, shaking the financial system and threatening in particular small or vulnerable clients (SMEs, households, and also low- and middle-income countries). In addition, it is argued that volatility-induced threats result from structural characteristics of the financial markets themselves (reactivity, reflexivity, and recursivity). The article introduces the concept of volatility, and different approaches to understanding risks related to the financial system (e.g., financial analysis, systems analysis). Two cases related to systemic risk are presented. The first concerns the role of volatility in three major financial crises (stock crash 1987, Asian crisis 1996 1997, global banking crisis 2007 2008), documenting that volatility spillovers have become a new normal. The second case concerns the moderate reflection of systemic risk within The Journal of Finance (the leading financial journal). The two cases show that volatility plays a role in systemic risks, but that this role has not yet been examined in detail by the scientific community. 2020 The Authors.

Our paper enriches the current literature as it is the first paper to investigate the volatility spillovers among major global tourism stock indices by adopting Diebold and Yilmaz (2012. Better to give than to receive: Predictive directional measurement of volatility spillovers. International Journal of Forecasting, 28(1), 57 66.), and Barunik and Krehlik (2018. Measuring the Frequency Dynamics of Financial Connectedness and Systemic Risk. Journal of Financial Econometrics, 16(2), 271 296.) time and frequency domain methods. suggest that total spillovers of the tourism stock indices rose significantly during the pandemic. Turkey and Italy are net volatility spillover transmitters, and others are net volatility spillover receivers. Findings of this study also indicates that the effect of volatility transmission among tourism stock markets is temporary (short-lasting). The suggest that short-term investors and portfolio managers should avoid investing in the tourism indices in the short term. 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Current Issues in Tourism,covid-19; stock market; volatility spillovers,"El Rifai, O.

"Mildenberger, C.D.",What (If anything) is wrong with high-frequency trading,"This essay examines three potential arguments against high-frequency trading and offers a qualified critique of the practice. In concrete terms, it examines a variant of high-frequency trading that is all about speed low-latency trading in light of moral issues surrounding arbitrage, information asymmetries, and systemic risk. The essay focuses on low-latency trading and the role of speed because it also aims to show that the commonly made assumption that speed in financial markets is morally neutral is wrong. For instance, speed is a necessary condition for low-latency trading’s potential to cause harm in flash crashes. On the other hand, it also plays a crucial role in a Lockean defense against low-latency trading being wasteful developed in this essay. Finally, this essay discusses the implications of these findings for related high-frequency trading techniques like futures arbitrage or latency arbitrage as well as for an argument as to why quote stuffing is wrong. Overall, the qualifications offered in this essay act as a counterbalance to overblown claims about trading at high speeds being wrong. 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-01-01,0,Journal of Business Ethics,arbitrage; information asymmetry; low-latency trading; speed; systemic risk,"Mildenberger, C.D.

"Meehan, P.; Sadan, M.; Aung, H.S.; Kham, P.S.; Muai, O.N.","Young people’s everyday pathways into drug harms in shan state, myanmar","In recent decades, youth drug use has become a cause of increasing concern across Asia and has inspired hardening drug control measures. However, consistently missing from drug narratives is a deeper engagement with young people themselves on why they use drugs and an understanding of the social, political, economic and cultural forces that shape their interactions with drugs. By engaging with the lived experiences of young people in the Myanmar city of Taunggyi, this paper offers new insights into the everyday pathways and practices through which systemic risk factors poverty, large-scale local drug production and poor welfare provision materialise into drug harms. This paper draws attention to three factors that shape these pathways: first, the role that drug-selling and drug consumption plays in the coping strategies that people deploy in an environment of economic hardship second, the intersections between drug use and gendered conceptions of youth and, third, the everyday institutional practices of local authorities. Exploring young people’s testimonies offers a grounded perspective for considering what can be done to reduce drug harms in a context where the structural determinants of drug risks are deeply entrenched and, in the context of post-coup Myanmar, likely to worsen. 2022 The Author(s).

"Li, L.; Muwafak, B.M.",Adoption of deep learning markov model combined with copula function in portfolio risk measurement,"In order to accurately describe the risk dependence structure and correlation between financial variables, a scientific financial risk assessment was carried out, and the basis for accurate financial decision-making was provided the basic theory of copula function is established first, and the mixed copula model is constructed then, the hybrid copula model is nested in a hidden Markov model (HMM) the risk dependences among banking, insurance, securities and trust industries are analysed, and the Copula-Garch model is constructed for empirical analysis of investment portfolio finally, the deep learning Markov model is adopted to predict the financial index. The show that the mixed copula model based on the HMM is more effective than the single copula model and the mixed copula model. The empirical structure shows that among the four major financial industries in China, banking and insurance industries have strong interdependence and a high probability of risk contagion. The investment failure rate under 95%, 97.5% and 99% confidence intervals calculated by the Copula-Garch model is 4.53%, 2.17% and 1.08%, respectively. Moreover, the errors of the deep learning Markov model in stock price prediction of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (sh600000), Guizhou Moutai (sh600519) and China Ping An Insurance (sh601318) are 2.56%, 2.98% and 3.56%, respectively, which indicates that the four major financial industries in China have strong interdependence and risk contagion so that the macro or systemic risks may arise, and the deep learning Markov model can be adopted to predict the stock prices. 2021 Liangxiong Li et al., published by Sciendo 2021.",2021,2021-01-01,0,Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,copula functions; copula models; costs; decision making; decision theory; deep learning; failure analysis; failure rate; financial index; financial markets; forecasting; hidden markov models; hidden-markov models; hmm; investment failure rate; investments; markov modeling; mixed copula model; mixed copulas; risk assessment; risk contagion; roller bearings,"Li, L.

"d’Udekem, B.",Agency conflicts and dividend persistence,"Bank dividends are unusually persistent. In a crisis, they exacerbate systemic risk and raise concerns for regulators. Bank managers, however, may keep dividends elevated to mitigate agency conflicts with shareholders. One theory holds that persistent dividends may substitute for monitoring by dispersed shareholders. A second theory proposes that they attract institutional shareholders who monitor banks, mitigate agency conflicts, and seek to protect their investments’ value. After controlling for regulatory enforcement actions, we test both theories using 7722 bank-quarter observations spanning the 2007 2009 financial crisis. Our suggest that dividend persistence increases with managerial agency conflicts but decreases in the presence of concentrated institutional shareholders, consistent with the second theory. In addition, contrary to the first theory, dispersed shareholders have no influence on bank dividend policies. Instead, these dispersed shareholders are associated with more frequent stock repurchase programs. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2021-01-01,4,Journal of Financial Services Research,agency conflicts; banks; dividends; institutional shareholders; stock repurchases,"d’Udekem, B.

"Yildirim, F.",Analysis of the relationship between countercyclical capital buffer and performance and risk indicators of the banking sector,"This study aims to explain the association between the quarterly data obtained over the period 2007: Q2-2020: Q3 for Turkey and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) proposed within the framework of Basel III with banking performance and risk indicators. For this purpose the association among the variables was analyzed using the ARDL model and by performing the Toda Yamamoto (T-Y) causality test. According to the analysisit was determined that the CCyB has a statistically significant and positive relationship with the capital adequacy indicators of the banks in the long-run, however, it has a statistically significant and negative relationship with the asset quality risk and currency risk indicators. In the short-run it was determined that the CCyB has a statistically significant and positive relationship with the capital adequacy, profitability and liquidity indicators and similar to the long-term relationship, it has a statistically significant and negative relationship with the asset quality risk and exchange rate risk indicators. According to the causality testa statistically significant and unilateral causality running from the indicators of capital adequacy, asset quality and exchange rate risk to the CCyB was detected. The obtained estimation indicate that the CCyB can be increased by policymakers during the periods when the performance indicators of the banking sector rise, whereas can be decreased by policymakers during the periods when the risk indicators of the sector rise. Furthermore, the of the study asserted that the CCyB was an appropriate instrument for mitigating the macroeconomic and systemic risks for Turkey. 2021 Furkan Ylldlrlm, published by Sciendo.",2021,2021-01-01,1,Economics and Business Review,ardl model; countercyclical capital buffer; performance indicators; risk indicators; toda yamamoto causality test,"Yildirim, F.

First of all, the paper analyzes two different financing modes of the innovative modelthe pledge financing mode and the factoring financing mode. Secondly, the paper explains the sources of credit risks for accounts receivable supply chain financing under credit insurance, and the necessity of using credit insurance. The sources of credit risks mainly include: the enterprises' comprehensive strength under systemic and non-systemic risks, status of accounts receivable, supply chain operation, performance of insurance companies, and so on. In addition, based on the credit risks explained in this paper, the risk assessment system and the credit risk assessment model are built. At the end, the paper offers three suggestions for the banks' financing risk control: bank should carefully check the policy's exclusions clauses bank must carefully check the authenticity of accounts receivable bank can use dynamic monitoring on qualification checking for financing enterprises, core enterprises and insurance companies.

"Xu, B.; Chen, J.; Zhang, S.; Shen, S.; Lan, X.; Chen, Z.; Yan, Z.; Xu, B.",Association between the severity of diabetic retinopathy and optical coherence tomography angiography metrics,"Diabetic retinopathy, the most serious ocular complication of diabetes, imposes a serious economic burden on society. Automatic and assessment of vessel changes can effectively manage diabetic retinopathy and prevent blindness. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics have been confirmed to be used to assess vessel changes. The accuracy and reliability of OCTA metrics are restricted by vessel segmentation methods. In this study, a multi-branch retinal vessel segmentation method is proposed, which is comparable to the segmentation obtained from the manual segmentation, effectively extracting vessels in low contrast areas and improving the integrity of the extracted vessels. OCTA metrics based on the proposed segmentation method were validated to be reliable for further analysis of the relationship between OCTA metrics and diabetes and the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Changes in vessel morphology are influenced by systemic risk factors. However, there is a lack of analysis of the relationship between OCTA metrics and systemic risk factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 362 eyes of 221 diabetic patients and 1,151 eyes of 587 healthy people. Eight systemic risk factors were confirmed to be closely related to diabetes. After controlling these systemic risk factors, significant OCTA metrics (such as vessel complexity index, vessel diameter index, and mean thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer centered in the macular) were found to be related to diabetic retinopathy and severe diabetic retinopathy. This study provides evidence to support the potential value of OCTA metrics as biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy.

In a percolation model we simulate runs for different strategies of economic agents to study diverse types of fluctuations and the limits for an eventual phase transition (characterized by the existence of booms or market crash). The liquidity of financial assets arises as a result of agent’s interaction and not as intrinsic properties of the assets. We focus on the formation process of the phase transition probability. Small differences in the strategic rules adopted by the agents lead to divergent paths of market liquidity.

Indeed, this work presents a comparative approach between the efficient capital market principals and the fundamentals of ICOs based on a documentary and qualitative analysis of the scientific literature and ICOs professional reports concerning the most relevant keywords related to the conceptual framework of market efficiency. As a result, we conclude according to our comparative conceptual model that ICOs market based on smart contract has many similarities with the efficient capital market where the self-regulation is the rule and each investor has free access to relevant information, and then all transactions are executed in such trust and transparency. Moreover, many factors such as regulation and institutional disclosure, liquidity and systemic risk have a significant impact on the market efficiency according to the scientific literature and professional experiences. 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2021,2021-01-01,0,International Journal of Business Performance Management,behavioural finance; blockchain technology; disintermediation; efficient market hypothesis; emh; icos; initial coin offerings; transparency,"Lachaari, M.

"Qin, A.Z.",China: confronting a growing wealth management sector,"China’s fast-growing wealth management market beckons both local and global asset management firms which have raced to strengthen their market share in China. However, the absence of more targeted wealth management laws and regulations, and the weak enforcement of the existing laws, have raised concerns about systemic risk in China’s financial sector and investor protection. This chapter reviews the main provisions applicable to wealth management activity in China, particularly financial advisory businesses. It argues that the current sectoral regime remains suitable and adequately responsive to the need for investor protection. More specifically, the use of merit regulation measures remains appropriate given China’s large population of unsophisticated retail investors and the emerging nature of the industry. However, as the wealth management market becomes more complex in terms of the financial products on offer, and retail investors need more comprehensive protection, more holistic and extensive provisions along the lines of those seen elsewhere may be needed.

"Enoch, C.",Conclusions,"In the time of risks, strong institutions to handle risk are essential. Risks have important financial repercussions, even when not originating on the financial side, so the institutions managing financial risk are centrally involved across the range of risks. The European Systemic Risk Board therefore warrants support and enhancement: a number of proposals are set out. And while some parts of the European agenda, such as Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), can validly be discretionary amongst member states, risks are pervasive and contagious, so risk management needs to be inclusive. The chapter argues for care in unwinding risk mitigation measures introduced at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject to changes and stresses due to diverse factors including solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology. The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such interactions increasingly dynamic, posing novel risks, and presenting new challenges to manage the coupled human natural system. This paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across diverse domains that may be used to assess risks to electric grid reliability, including climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domain interconnections. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data science, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union in systemic risk indicators.

"Ben-Ishai, S.","Dangerous opportunities: the future of financial institutions, housing policy, and governance","The 2017 Home Capital saga represents the shortcomings of a financial system challenged by distinct, siloed regulatory frameworks that fail to communicate with each other. Home Capital is a publicly traded company that acts as a lender through the Home Trust Company, most often providing mortgages to clients rejected by traditional banks. Home Capital's 2017 announcement that it required $2 billion to sustain a $600-million loss shook customer confidence, and fueled by allegations of corruption, the company suffered a rapid decline in stock price. The Home Capital crisis is the most recent pre-pandemic example of systemic risk in the financial sector in Canada and highlights the invaluable opportunity we have to avoid repeating past mistakes in the nearing post-pandemic economic reality. Using the 2017 Home Capital saga as a starting point, Dangerous Opportunities sheds light on the compartmentalization of regulators and its greater ramifications on board independence and corporate governance, taxation in the competitive housing sector, and the success of non-bank financial institutions in various jurisdictions. A hybrid of law and business, Dangerous Opportunities is a must-read for those interested in the underbelly of financial institutions and is an inspired read in the aftermath of the recent housing crisis, which saw many aspiring homeowners seek dangerous opportunities outside of the traditional banking system.

Our paper examines the impact of bank ownership structure on the relationship between derivative use and lending activities of U.S. banks. We find that lending recovered faster in larger banks than smaller banks post-crisis and in line with Diamond’s (Diamond DW 1984 Financial intermediation and delegated monitoring. Rev Econ Stud 51:393 414) systemic risk reduction theory, derivative use is positively associated with lending growth. Ownership is significant in explaining the magnitude of the relationship even after controlling for alternative specifications of the derivative use variable. In both normal and crisis periods, the speed of adjustment of lending to derivatives use by stock banks lags that of mutual banks. We suggest that speculative trading in derivatives substitutes for lending growth to a larger extent for stock banks compared to mutual banks. These findings may have important implications for investors and bank regulators. 2020, Academy of Economics and Finance.",2021,2021-01-01,0,Journal of Economics and Finance,bank lending; commercial banks; derivative use; dynamic gmm method; ownership structure,"Abugri, B.A. (School of Business, Southern Connecticut State University, New Haven, CT, United States); Osah, T.T.

"Lazareva, E.I.; Gavrilova, J.V.; Murzin, A.D.",Development of hr-management tools for an innovation-oriented organization using system analysis,"The HR-management system of modern innovation-oriented organizations is characterized by a variety of decision support tools. The main goal of the study is to substantiate the features and algorithm for solving the urgent problem of systemic risk assessment in the structure of HR management and to rank HR risks for identifying the most effective strategy for their minimization. The solution to this problem is based on the system analysis methodologythe key methodology for making multi-criteria decisions in the area of HR management, the main characteristics of which are taking into account multidimensional criteria (the assessment of its alternatives aren’t always unambiguous) and different types of qualitative risk indicators and complexly structured factors. The result of a systematic analysis of HR-risks of an innovation-oriented organization (university) was the classification of the risks characteristic of the HR-management system, according to their sources (taking into account the effects). The identified four integrated risks in the organization’s HR management system include the integrated risks of individual human capital management Lack of employee competencies and Lack of managerial competenciesand also the integrated risks Failures in the organization’s strategic policy and Failures in the organization’s motivational policy. Application of the Dematel method to solving the problem of multi-criteria analysis of causal relationships between integrated HR risks made it possible to identify a pattern among the many existing in the complex system under study, to rank risks by priority and to develop a strategy for their minimization. The novelty of the author’s approach lies in the substantiation of the algorithm for systemic risk assessment in the structure of HR management using the Dematel multi-criteria analysis method, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in terms of identifying the cause-effect pattern in a complex HR risk management system and also of ranking the organization’s HR risks. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2021-01-01,0,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,dematel method; hr-management; hr-risks; innovation-oriented organization; systems analysis,"Lazareva, E.I.

"McAuliffe, M.; Blower, J.; Beduschi, A.",Digitalization and artificial intelligence in migration and mobility: transnational implications of the covid-19 pandemic,"Digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in migration and mobility have incrementally expanded over recent years. Iterative approaches to AI deployment experienced a surge during 2020 and into 2021, largely due to COVID-19 forcing greater reliance on advanced digital technology to monitor, inform and respond to the pandemic. This paper critically examines the implications of intensifying digitalization and AI for migration and mobility systems for a post-COVID transnational context. First, it situates digitalization and AI in migration by analyzing its uptake throughout the Migration Cycle. Second, the article evaluates the current challenges and, opportunities to migrants and migration systems brought about by deepening digitalization due to COVID-19, finding that while these expanding technologies can bolster human rights and support international development, potential gains can and are being eroded because of design, development and implementation aspects. Through a critical review of available literature on the subject, this paper argues that recent changes brought about by COVID-19 highlight that computational advances need to incorporate human rights throughout design and development stages, extending well beyond technical feasibility. This also extends beyond tech company references to inclusivity and transparency and requires analysis of systemic risks to migration and mobility regimes arising from advances in AI and related technologies. 2021 by the authors.

"Parsons, M.; Reeve, I.; McGregor, J.; Hastings, P.; Marshall, G.R.; McNeill, J.; Stayner, R.; Glavac, S.",Disaster resilience in australia: A geographic assessment using an index of coping and adaptive capacity,"This paper reports a national-scale assessment of disaster resilience, using the Australian Disaster Resilience Index. The index assesses resilience at three levels: overall capacity for disaster resilience coping and adaptive capacity and, eight themes of disaster resilience across social, economic and institutional domains. About 32% of Australia's population (7.6 million people) live in an area assessed as having high capacity for disaster resilience. About 52% of Australia's population (12.3 million people) live in an area assessed as having moderate capacity for disaster resilience. The remaining 16% of Australia's population (3.8 million people) live in an area assessed as having low capacity for disaster resilience. Distribution of disaster resilience in Australia is strongly influenced by a geography of remoteness. Most metropolitan and inner regional areas were assessed as having high capacity for disaster resilience. In contrast, most outer regional, remote and very remote areas were assessed as having low capacity for disaster resilience, although areas of low capacity for disaster resilience can occur in metropolitan areas. Juxtaposed onto this distribution, themes of disaster resilience highlight strengths and barriers to disaster resilience in different communities. For example, low community capital and social cohesion is a disaster resilience barrier in many metropolitan areas, but higher community capital and social cohesion in outer regional and some remote areas supports disaster resilience. The strategic intent of a shared responsibility for disaster resilience can benefit from understanding the spatial distribution of disaster resilience, so that policies and programmes can address systemic influences on disaster resilience. 2021 The Authors",2021,2021-01-01,17,International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,composite index; disaster resilience; indicators; national scale assessment; systemic risk,"Parsons, M.

"Wang, J.; Li, J.; Zhang, Q.",Does carbon efficiency improve financial performance evidence from chinese firms,"In response to the global climate change, the actions of Chinese government to cut down carbon emissions have brought great risks and opportunities to firms. Considering that the production process with energy consumption is inevitably accompanied by carbon emissions, this paper uses SBM-DEA model with undesirable output to evaluate firms' carbon efficiency from production perspective. Then we use the fixed-effect panel data model to study the relationship between carbon efficiency and financial performance of Chinese firms. Furthermore, we analyze whether the resource efficiency has a moderation effect on the relationship between carbon efficiency and financial performance. The show that the carbon efficiency has a significantly positive effect on the total asset turnover (short-term operating capacity) and Tobin's(long-term market value) of Chinese firms, while impacts the total risk (the combination of systemic and non-systemic risks) negatively and significantly, especially for firms in carbon-intensive industries. With the improvement of resource efficiency, the impact of carbon efficiency on financial performance begins to weaken. The carbon efficiency and financial performance have monotonic effect, while resource efficiency and carbon efficiency have interactive effect. Overall, we prove that high carbon efficiency can improve the financial performance, as well as reduce the risks of firms.

"Commain, S.",Don’t crunch my credit’: member state governments’ preferences on bank capital requirements,"Across Europe, banks remain, to this day, the main suppliers of finance to the European economy, but also a source of systemic risk. As such, regulating them requires that policymakers find an appropriate balance between restricting their risk-taking behaviour and increasing lending to support economic growth. However, the varieties of financial capitalism’ that characterize national banking sectors in Europe mean that the adoption of harmonised capital requirements has different effects across countries, depending on the country-specific institutional setting through which banks provide lending to the national economy.

"Chen, J.; Zhu, Q.; Başar, T.",Dynamic contract design for systemic cyber risk management of interdependent enterprise networks,"The interconnectivity of cyber and physical systems and Internet of things has created ubiquitous concerns of cyber threats for enterprise system managers. It is common that the asset owners and enterprise network operators need to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk by remunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this paper, we use a principal agent framework to capture the service relationships between the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal) and the cyber risk manager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management problem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber risk outcomes of the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that the manager expends on protecting the resources. Under this information pattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational behaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic contract design within the framework of a class of stochastic differential games. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent’s hidden efforts. We characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a stochastic optimal control program which can be solved using dynamic programming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario with complete information and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead to a new certainty equivalence principle for principal agent problems. Finally, case studies over networked systems are carried out to illustrate the theoretical obtained. 2020, Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2021-01-01,3,Dynamic Games and Applications,differential games; dynamic contracts; economics of cybersecurity; internet of things; systemic risk,"Chen, J.

"Xingmin, Z.; Qiang, F.; Shuai, Z.; Hao, Z.",Dynamic tail financial network structure and contagion measurement:based on rolling lasso high-dimensional time series model,"The lessons learned from the 2007-2009 global financial crisis show that high-infectivity, high destructiveness and high complexity are the significant systemic risk characteristics. Constructing network structure and further clarifying spillover effects across financial firms is crucial to interpret systemic risk correctly,and it is becoming the main focus of academia and regulatory agencies. Moreover, substantial evidence shows that the tail risk spillover effects are always dynamic due to the internal and external shocks. Thus, the structural changes in the risk transmission relations are a remarkable element for constructing network structure.This paper explores the tail risk dependence among financial firms using the extended version of the high-dimensional lasso quantile regression model. We investigate the tail risk spillover effects and systemic risk of 52 listed financial firms in China, consisting of banks, insurances, securities, and real estate firms, ranging from January 13, 2013, to March 25, 2018. The analysis mixes the market informationweekly stock returns), book informationquarterly financial statements), and the macroeconomic informationmacroeconomic state variables). In this paper, we decompose the network contagion relations into multiple levels, that is, the aggregate network connection of the whole financial system, the internal-industry, across financial sectors, and across financial firms. Furthermore, we evaluate the systemic importance of financial firms from the risk emitter and risk receiver perspectives.First, we measure the financial systemtail risk network structure using the combination model of the high-dimensional quantile regression model and the Lasso penalty method, revealing the complicated contagion relationships in the whole financial system, between financial sectors, within financial sectors, and between financial firms. According to this, financial institutions network dependence is ranked from the receiving and the transmitting perspectives. Thus, we can obtain the systemic importance of financial firms from the aspects of network connection .Second, to better capture the tail risk infection relationshipstructural mutation, this paper establishes a statistical standard to select the optimal rolling window width. More precisely, we minimize the model estimators quadratic loss function and maximize the standardized Euclidean distance between sub-models, weighing two contradictory goals of model estimation accuracy and time variability.The empirical show that the new rolling window width selection criterion significantly improves the dynamics identification of the financial network structure compared to the traditional approaches, showing the necessity and effectiveness of choosing the industry, and cross-institutional) show a significantly sharp increase and high fluctuations during extreme economic distress, for instance, the 2015 stock crash in China. The cross-industry spillover effects are increasingly grim with strong correlations between banks and insurance, and real estate institutions and other financial institutions, deserving more attention from regulations. Regarding the risk contagion within financial sectors, the risk spillover effects between banks are the weakest, while the contagion intensity is more vigorous within the insurance sector and real estate. The financial firms receiving and transmitting the most risk contagion are still banks and securities. More than 50% of financial institutions in the system tend to receive risk contagion. That is, systemic risk exposure is significantly higher than the systemic risk contribution. If a systemic shock strikes unexpectedly, the whole system will be hit hard. Therefore, the capacity of such institutions to handle external shocks should be strengthened.These findings in this paper help understand Chinafinancial systemnetwork contagion characteristics, revealing how the tail risk of financial firms is connected. The network analysis also provides insight into how to measure and define systemic risk. For financial regulatory and financial institutions, our study shows a basis and direction for systemic risk management and supervision. 2021.

We proposed a time-migrated DCCA cross-correlation coefficient which is beneficial to detect the asynchronous correlations of nonstationary time series. The stock market network is constructed with the threshold method based on time-migrated DCCA. The effectiveness of the price limit during the stock market crash period is studied based on the time-migrated DCCA stock market network. The indicate that the time-migrated DCCA ensures more relevant than the equal-time DCCA method. An interesting finding is that the price limit has different effects on the stock market network at different stages of dynamic evolution.

There are three different procedural safeguards to avoidfinancial stability risks: a) ex ante assessment of third countries’ regulation to ensure regulatory compatibility between the EU and the third country b) ex postwithdrawal of market access if cross-border liberalization triggers a race to the bottom and c) direct supervision of systemic third-country entities to prevent them from becoming vectors of cross-border systemic risk. The article argues that those safeguards are ineffective in protecting the internal market from external risks. It proposes two alternative reforms. First, the EU could replace equivalence with a system of substituted compliance, following the US model where foreign financial firms must register with local authorities and follow host country regulation. Alternatively, the EU could reinforce the assessment, withdrawal, and supervisory procedure by harmonizing the current patchwork of different equivalence rules. 2021.

Methods: Preterm infants born 2000 grams birth weight (BW) and or 34 weeks gestational age (GA) undergoing ROP screening were enrolled prospectively. Visual acuity was recorded using Teller Acuity Cards. Contrast threshold was measured with Newborn Contrast Cards at first screening visit and at the end of ROP screening at 40 weeks of postmenstrual age or older.Of the 173 study infants, 134 (77.5%) did not have any stage of ROP. Of the remaining 39 (22.5%), 34 (87%) had typeROP and(13%) had typeROP requiring treatment. The mean contrast threshold at the first visit of the no ROP typeand typegroups was 0.36 0.07, 0.65 0.19, and 0.46 0.09, respectively (P 0.001). Contrast threshold had a significant correlation with BW (R 0.291,0.001) and gestational age (R 0.47,0.001). The contrast threshold at the first visit correlated with visual acuity measured atmonths of corrected age in logMAR (R 0.36,0.01). Other than BW and GA, no other systemic risk factors correlated with contrast threshold measured at the first screening visit.Newborn Contrast Cards are a viable tool to test contrast threshold in preterm infants. The association between contrast threshold and ROP, and its correlation with visual acuity, suggest that contrast threshold measurement may help predict the clinical vision outcome among prematurely born infants. Translational Relevance: Contrast threshold measurement may prove to be a useful tool in the estimation of visual potential in preterm infants. 2021 The Authors.",2021,2021-01-01,1,Translational Vision Science and Technology,article; birth weight; child; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; contrast sensitivity; contrast threshold; cycloplegic refraction; eye refraction; female; follow up; gestational age; human; infant; infants; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; nonhuman; observational study; pilot study; prematurity; prospective study; refraction error; retinopathy of prematurity; retrolental fibroplasia; risk factor; screening; teller acuity cards; visual acuity; visual system examination; wide-field imaging,"Thomas, R.

"Chamizo, Á.; Novales, A.",Evaluation of market risk associated with hedging a credit derivative portfolio,"Hedging a credit portfolio using single-name credit default swap (CDS) is affected by low liquidity and high spread volatility, which induces continuous changes in a portfolio mark-to-market. As an alternative, we consider hedging a derivative portfolio by taking a contrary position in a credit index, evaluating the empirical market risk that remains after such hedge. We perform three different hedging exercises: for single-names, for sectorial portfolios and for regional portfolios. We implement least squares hedging as a benchmark, and compare its efficiency with a hedge ratio estimated under the RiskMetrics exponentially moving average (EWMA) specification for time varying second order moments, as well as with the hedge ratio obtained from a bivariate GARCH model for the portfolio and the credit index used as a hedge. Over the 2007 2012 period, we find a high hedging efficiency for regional portfolios (Europe, North America and Japan), as well as for a global portfolio, which is back at pre-crisis levels. The EWMA hedge is slightly more efficient than the least-squares hedge, while the GARCH hedge does not improve hedging efficiency. Hedging efficiency is not as high for sectorial credit portfolios from Europe and North America, due to their more important idiosyncratic component. Taking into account the quality of the credit counterpart improves the effectiveness of the hedge, although it requires using less liquid credit indices, with higher transaction costs. This hedging strategy becomes much more complex if firms in the portfolio have a large idiosyncratic component. The efficiency of the hedge is higher when liquidity risk and systematic risk are high, or when the term structure is flat. We also provide evidence suggesting that credit indices can also offer a moderately efficient hedge for corporate bond portfolios, which we have examined with a reduced sample of firms over 2006 2018. 2021 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",2021,2021-01-01,0,Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,asset allocation; cds; credit hedge; credit indices; market risk; systemic risk,"Chamizo, Á.

"Olawusi-Peters, O.O.",Evaluation of water quality and heavy metal pollution in the shoots and roots of aquatic plants,"The safety of vegetables has been an issue of public concern in recent years. Thus, heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Mn, Pb, Zn and Fe) in the shoot and root of Sacciolepis africana, Ceratophyllun demersum and Pistia stratiotes in Owena reservoir, Nigeria were tested using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer while some Physico-chemical parameters of water were measured using multi parameter hand-held meter. The water quality result revealed that the average temperature, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH were 27.77oC, 7.21NTU, 101.83Ω S, 6.95mgand 6.55 respectively. The single factor pollution index showed that Temperature (0.93), DO (0.99) and pH (0.99) fell within the category of slight pollution while turbidity (1.20) and conductivity (1.02) fell within the medium pollution category. Sacciolepis africana bio-concentrated more heavy metals than Ceratophyllun demersum and Pistia stratiotes. The HRIs of Cu, Cd, Mn, Zn and Fe indicated no risk since all values were less than 1. However, there was a potential risk for Pb through the consumption of the plants despite that the HRI of the shoot of Ceratophyllun demersum (0.65) and root of Pistia stratiotes (0.46) were less than 1. The THQ and HI values for the root and shoot of all the vegetables were less than 1, indicating that they are unlikely to result in any chronic systemic risk-averse health effects. 2021, Central Fisheries Research Inst.

Design methodology approach: The study applied the autoregressive GARCH panel model approach proposed by Fakhry and Richter (2015) to evaluate the presence of excess volatility and then examined the diversification benefits. Further, the use of discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) has added the advantage to observe volatility across bonds along with potential diversification benefits by retaining information from the time and frequency domain perspective for both the maturities. Findings: The main finding indicates that the excess volatility is present in BRICS countries at individual level i.e. in the case of Russia, India and China. However, the 10-year bond showing a less volatility compared to 5-year bond with the possibility of reaping out the benefits of diversification with international portfolio of sovereign bonds. Practical implications: The main implication of the research is related to the non-perseverance of EMH as far sovereign bonds of BRICS countries are concerned as the indicate presence of excess volatility in the 5-year and 10-year bond markets. However, the implicit behavior of 5-year bond could benefit the active fund managers and investors by taking an advantage of a reducing systemic risk through short-medium term investments.

Currency shocks as a source of financial contagion in the banking sector have not, so far, been considered. Our model considers two sources of contagion: shocks to nonbank assets and exchange rate shocks. Interbank loans can mature at different times. We demonstrate that a dominant currency can be a significant source of financial contagion. We also find evidence of asymmetries in losses stemming from large currency depreciations versus appreciations. A variety of scenarios are considered allowing for differences in the sparsity of the banking network, the relative size and number of banks, changes in nonbank assets and equity, the possibility of bank breakups, and the dominance of a particular currency.

We build financial systemic risk pressure indexes, including currency crisis pressure (CCP) banking crisis pressure (BCP) index, bubble crisis pressure (PBP) index, and external shock pressure (ESP) index to predict financial crises. Finally, four indicators that have a significant impact on the systemic financial crisis pressure index were selected, namely, the stock price index change rate, industrial added value growth rate, domestic and foreign real deposit interest rate differential, and foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP. A dynamic Logit model with lagging binary variables is constructed, and compared with the traditional static Logit line, the actual dynamic fitting effect is better than the static Logit model. The dynamic Logit model is used to predict the early warning status of systemic financial crisis in 2020, and the forecast of various early warning indicators is realized by the ARIMA model. The final prediction show that the probability of a systemic financial crisis in China in 2020 is extremely low, almost zero.

We examine the reaction of banks' stocks, bonds, and credit default swaps to the announcements of monetary penalties. We observe a reduced default risk and lower financing costs, as well an increase in the stock market valuation, suggesting that banks benefit from settling lawsuits. The positive reaction is likely driven by the resolution of uncertainty surrounding these proceedings. While the sued bank's systemic risk increases in the size of the relative monetary penalty, we also document positive spillover effects to other banks facing pending lawsuits with the same plaintiff, demonstrating the systemic effect of law enforcement against banks. Furthermore, banks appear to correctly anticipate penalties, as they are cash flow-effective but not income-effective in the year they are announced. 2021",2021,2021-01-01,4,Journal of Corporate Finance,banks; financial markets; lawsuits; legal fines; settlements,"Flore, C.

"Gauß, P.; Parlings, M.","Framework for indicator-based, sociotechnical project risk monitoring","Purpose: Many Industry 4.0 projects fail because impending sociotechnical risks are managed insufficiently. An indicator-based, sociotechnical risk monitoring can help to overcome this challenge. However, its effectiveness depends significantly on selecting appropriate risk indicators. This paper outlines a framework that helps decision-makers with the necessary structuring, allowing for subsequent indicator definition. Methodology: Indicators must be embedded in specific contexts to be meaningful. The design of indicator-based monitoring systems, therefore, first requires an appropriate framework. For this purpose, specific requirements related to digitization projects are derived from both literature and practitioners' needs. Findings: Risks in the context of Industry 4.0 projects are systemic risks. For efficient monitoring, new approaches are needed that can manage this high complexity. Systems theory is found suitable to develop a new framework for indicator-based, sociotechnical project risk monitoring. The framework considers the characteristics of projects and enterprises as complex, open, and sociotechnical systems. Originality: Especially in complex projects like those of Industry 4.0, situational risk awareness can contribute crucially to project success. However, achieving this awareness always requires tailored approaches addressing the unique project characteristics. To help solve this challenge for digitization projects, the proposed framework sets both a sciencebased and practitioner-relevant foundation for subsequent derivation of sociotechnical risk indicators. 2021 Proceedings of the Hamburg International Conference of Logistics.

"Crafa, S.",From agent-based modeling to actor-based reactive systems in the analysis of financial networks,"We present a new framework for the analysis of financial networks, called Actor-based Reactive Systems (ARS), that pushes further the Agent-Based approach (ABM) by resorting to ideas coming from the study of distributed systems in computer science. Two distinctive features, namely a fundamentally different management of time and a fully decentralized control logic, have a profound impact in terms of expressiveness of analysis, flexibility of modeling, and efficiency of experimentation. To illustrate the feasibility of the framework, we develop a realistic case study by analyzing the systemic risk of a model of the European banking network with a nontrivial contagion procedure, that combines an initial asset shock with the negative feedback loop triggered by asset fire sales. We show that, compared to ABMs, ARSs bring about finer-grained analyses, with a greater degree of heterogeneity and adaptivity of economic agents. Moreover, the very low computational cost and the detailed account of the system’s execution support the design and the development of very flexible stress tests to rapidly experiment with many hypothetical scenarios in a test-oriented style. 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2021-01-01,1,Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination,agent-based models; computational models; distributed systems; reactive systems; systemic risk,"Crafa, S.

"Zhang, Q.; Li, F.",From systematic risk to systemic risk: analysis over day-ahead market operation under high renewable penetration by covar and marginal covar,"Traditional power market risk studies focus on systematic risk analysis which relies on value-at-risk (VaR) or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to measure potential financial losses resulting from renewable generation uncertainties. However, systematic risk only reflects the risk of a single entity and cannot capture the systemic risk which measures the risk contribution from a market participant to the overall market or the risk connection between two different market participants. With the rapid integration of renewable energy resources, it is essentially important to identify which renewable assets contribute a higher risk to market operations. Therefore, we propose two systemic risk measures, Contagious VaR (CoVaR) and marginal CoVaR (ΔCoVaR), to construct the risk connection network of the energy market under high renewable penetrations. Then, based on ΔCoVaR, a new index called normalized ΔCoVaR is built for market operators to evaluate the per MW impact on ΔCoVaR. Further, this paper proposes two approaches to manage the systemic risk in a day-ahead (DA) market, depending on regulation purposes. Finally, the proposed risk measures and management methods are applied to analyze a DA market with over 30% renewable energy penetration in a modified IEEE 118-bus system. 2010-2012 IEEE.",2021,2021-01-01,6,Ieee Transactions on Sustainable Energy,conditional value-at-risk; contagious value-at-risk (covar); electricity market; high-penetration renewable generation; ieee 118-bus system; integration of renewable energies; losses; management method; market operation; market participants; power markets; renewable energy penetrations; renewable energy resources; renewable generation; risk analysis; risk assessment; systematic risk; systemic risk; uncertainty analysis; value engineering,"Zhang, Q.

"Aven, T.; Zio, E.",Globalization and global risk: how risk analysis needs to be enhanced to be effective in confronting current threats,"In the last 20-30 years, technological innovation has enabled the advancement of industry at a global scale, giving rise to a truly global society, resting on an interdependent web of transnational technical, economic and social systems. These systems are exposed to scenarios of cascading outbreaks, whose impacts can ripple to very large scales through their strong interdependencies, as recently shown by the pandemic spreading of the Coronavirus. Considerable work has been conducted in recent years to develop frameworks to support the assessment, communication, management and governance of this type of risk, building on concepts like systemic risks, complexity theory, deep uncertainties, resilience engineering, adaptive management and black swans. Yet contemporary risk analysis struggles to provide authoritative societal guidance for adequately handling these types of risks, as clearly illustrated by the Coronavirus case. In this paper, we reflect on this situation. We aim to identify critical challenges in current frameworks of risk assessment and management and point to ways to strengthen these, to be better able to confront threats like the Coronavirus in the future. A set of principles and theses are established, which have the potential to support a common foundation for the many different scientific perspectives and schools’ currently dealing with risk handling issues. 2020 The Author(s)",2021,2021-01-01,23,Reliability Engineering and System Safety,adaptive management; complexity theory; coronavirus; critical challenges; deep uncertainties; global risk; resilience; resilience engineerings; risk analysis; risk assessment; risk assessment and managements; risk science; social aspects; systemic risks; technological innovation,"Aven, T.

"Martino, E.D.; Parchimowicz, K.M.",Go preventive or go homethe double nature of MREL,"Bank Resolution is considered a cornerstone of the post-crisis financial regulation however, it is also widely considered ineffective and inefficient in handling bank failures. This article analyses the preventive potential of the resolution framework, specifically focusing on the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). We argue that MREL has a double nature. On the one hand, it should ensure the feasibility of resolution in case of a bank failure. On the other hand, it aims at restricting the funding model of banks, similarly to the other (preventive) capital requirements. By analysing the 2019 reform of the EU banking regulation, we contend that MREL represents an important complement to the rest of the preventive regulatory framework and that the latest reform unleashes such potential. We demonstrate that the new rules on MREL determination and enforcement allow the resolution authority to look after the build-up of systemic risk. The analysis reveals that MREL can serve both micro- and macro-prudential purposes. Finally, we argue that the current institutional architecture represents the main impeding factor for the new regulation to efficiently work, curbing the positive preventive potential of MREL. 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin Boston.",2021,2021-01-01,1,European Company and Financial Law Review,bank resolution; brrd ii; macro-prudential regulation; mrel; preventive regulation,"Martino, E.D.

"Turalska, M.; Swami, A.",Greedy control of cascading failures in interdependent networks,"Complex systems are challenging to control because the system responds to the controller in a nonlinear fashion, often incorporating feedback mechanisms. Interdependence of systems poses additional difficulties, as cross-system connections enable malicious activity to spread between layers, increasing systemic risk. In this paper we explore the conditions for an optimal control of cascading failures in a system of interdependent networks. Specifically, we study the Bak Tang Wiesenfeld sandpile model incorporating a control mechanism, which affects the frequency of cascades occurring in individual layers. This modification allows us to explore sandpile-like dynamics near the critical state, with supercritical region corresponding to infrequent large cascades and subcritical zone being characterized by frequent small avalanches. Topological coupling between networks introduces dependence of control settings adopted in respective layers, causing the control strategy of a given layer to be influenced by choices made in other connected networks. We find that the optimal control strategy for a layer operating in a supercritical regime is to be coupled to a layer operating in a subcritical zone, since such condition corresponds to reduced probability of inflicted avalanches. However this condition describes a parasitic relation, in which only one layer benefits. Second optimal configuration is a mutualistic one, where both layers adopt the same control strategy. Our provide valuable insights into dynamics of cascading failures and and its control in interdependent complex systems. 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2021-01-01,4,Scientific Reports,article; avalanche; control strategy; probability,"Turalska, M.

"Li, X.",How effective are the transnational regulatory networks A perspective of international financial regulation,"Systemic repercussions across borders due to the transnational activities of financial conglomerates can pose common threats to jurisdictions worldwide as the last global financial crisis unfolded. In response, transnational regulatory networks (TRNs) in international financial regulation, such as the Basel Committee and IOSCO, have championed a sequence of initiatives on them at the international level. As sectoral TRNs, what roles they are playing for global financial stability remains to be studied in the context of financial globalisation. This article aims to examine these financial TRNs from the perspective of analysing their components in operation. After illustrating the popping-up of TRNs and its reasons, this article presents an overview of the existing literature on TRN theory, especially highlighting the most prominent arguments of relevant scholars. Building on this, it sets out the features and constituent elements of TRNs, especially the soft law mechanism. Then, by exploring these components, this article focuses on the effectiveness of TRNs in international financial regulation, examining their strengths and weaknesses in helping member regulators address cross-border systemic risk. This article finds that these TRNs play significant roles in converging financial regulatory norms and facilitating regulatory cooperation worldwide, despite their deficiencies in enforcement, sanction, structure and accountability. 2021, Manchester Journal of International Economic Law.

The increasing demand for these materials has triggered worries about the trade dependency on raw materials. Traditional trade dependency measures make it difficult to identify high-risk countries (regions) from a systematic perspective. This paper proposes a global dependency index to recalculate systemic risks in the trade dependency network. Unlike the traditional trade network analysis, we construct the resource-dependent network by taking the dependency relationship as the edge and the global dependency index as the weight. We use the new network to explore the characteristics of the overall pattern of global trade and the concentration of dependency. Then, considering the heterogeneity of trading agents, country (regional) dependency is analyzed at the local and global levels. The dependency relationship coordinates are constructed to identify high-risk countries (regions). The show that the trade is highly concentrated. Developed and emerging economies tend to import in quantity. The absolute dependency and global dependency of agents are heterogeneous. The distribution characteristics of agent relationships in the trade dependency coordinates are apparent. According to thepolicymakers and market participants can tailor trade strategies to reduce risks.

"Shanmugam, P.M.; Shah, P.; Ramanjulu, R.; Mishra, D.",Impact of systemic parameters before commencing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for diabetic macular edemapan-indian survey of retina specialists,"Purpose: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection therapy has emerged as the mainstay of treatment in the management of diabetic macular edema (DME) today. Various systemic risk factors have to be considered before initiating anti-VEGF therapy. The aim of our study was to form a consensus on various systemic factors to consider before starting anti-VEGF therapy for DME. Methods: A questionnaire was created and sent across to various retina specialists across India. A GoogleTM form with various questions pertaining to what systemic parameters would one consider before giving anti-VEGF therapy for DME was sent to each of them by email WhatsAppTM direct telephonic interview.Of the 650 retina specialists contacted, 322 responded to the questionnaire. There was no difference in responses between private and institutional practitioners. The majority would consider RBS (85%), HbA1c (61%), blood pressure (63%), and renal function (57%) as a routine before administering the anti-VEGF injection, while the majority would not consider hemoglobin (63%) or lipid profile (55%) of the patient as a routine practice prior to administering the injection. Conclusion: In our study, most VR specialists prefer to consider RBS, HbA1c, BP, and renal profile (creatinine) routinely prior to anti-VEGF injection. We suggest that it is important to consider blood pressure control, glycemic control, HbA1c, Hb, lipid profile, and renal profile (UACR, eGFR, and creatinine) prior to anti-VEGF therapy in all diabetic patients and to discuss the need for statins in patients with dyslipidemias with the physician.",2021,2021-01-01,0,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,anemia; angiogenesis inhibitor; angiogenesis inhibitors; complication; diabetes mellitus; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; human; humans; hypertension; intravitreal drug administration; intravitreal injections; macular edema; nephropathy; questionnaire; ranibizumab; retina; retina specialists; survey; surveys and questionnaires; systemic considerations for anti-vegf; vascular endothelial growth factor a; vasculotropin a,"Shanmugam, P.M.

"Zhu, B.; Lin, R.; Deng, Y.; Chen, P.; Chevallier, J.",Intersectoral systemic risk spillovers between energy and agriculture under the financial and COVID-19 crises,"Considering the severity and frequency of industry-specific shocks, this paper examines how sector-induced contagion effects caused by significant crises (e.g., the global financial crisis and COVID-19) propagate between energy and agricultural sectors worldwide. Relevant literature fails to concern the influence of these cross-sectoral transmission mechanisms on the energy-agriculture nexus and its relevance. By modifying the copula-extreme value theory-marginal expected shortfall (Copula-EVT-MES) method and using daily commodity returns from 2005M3 2020M5, our study captures significant intersectoral systemic risk spillovers, with asymmetrical and persistent patterns in energy-agricultural pairs. Furthermore, the bioethanol production (physical channel) and the financialization of commodities (financial channel) mainly relate to the shock spillovers. Compared to the financial crisis, the systemic risk spillovers in the COVID-19 crisis rely more on the physical channel, which emphasizes the importance of bioenergy-related shocks. The macro-conditions and supply-demand shocks are also important determinants for such spillovers during the ongoing crisis. 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2021-01-01,12,Economic Modelling,agricultural sector; bioenergy; covid-19; fossil energy; intersectoral systemic risk spillover,"Zhu, B.

"Enoch, C.",Introduction,"While many of the most critical issues facing the EU in the first 20 years of the twenty-first century related to the Euro, for the next 20 years the central focus will be how the EU handles a range of systemic risks: amongst the known risks are financial risks, health risks (Covid-19), climate risks, and the rise of nationalism. Ensuring strong institutions for handling risk is therefore critical in this connection the chapter introduces the European Systemic Risk Board, the body responsible for financial stability, and explains its projected wider role. The chapter briefly introduces some concepts used in the analysis, such as differentiated integration (DI), and the core and peripheryWhile many EU initiatives have reflected DI, leading to the present division between a core and a periphery of member states, risk management requires inclusivity. A model is briefly introduced, where the discretionary nature of some EU activities is recognized, but risk management is set in the inclusive superstructure. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2021-01-01,0,St Antony's Series,,"Enoch, C.

We introduce in this framework a financial stability authority in order to test the effects of different prudential policy measures designed to improve the resilience of the economic system. Simulations show that a combination of micro- and macroprudential policies reduces systemic risk but at the cost of increasing banks' capital volatility. Moreover, the agent-based methodology allows us to implement an alternative meso regulatory framework that takes into consideration the connections between firms and banks. This policy targets only the more connected banks, increasing their capital requirement in order to reduce the diffusion of local shocks. Our support the idea that the mesoprudential policy is able to reduce systemic risk without affecting the stability of banks' capital structure. 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Identifying the minimal set of units to attack to disintegrate a complex network, i.e. network dismantling, is a computationally challenging (NP-hard) problem which is usually attacked with heuristics. Here, we show that a machine trained to dismantle relatively small systems is able to identify higher-order topological patterns, allowing to disintegrate large-scale social, infrastructural and technological networks more efficiently than human-based heuristics. Remarkably, the machine assesses the probability that next attacks will disintegrate the system, providing a quantitative method to quantify systemic risk and detect early-warning signals of system’s collapse. This demonstrates that machine-assisted analysis can be effectively used for policy and decision-making to better quantify the fragility of complex systems and their response to shocks. 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2021-01-01,26,Nature Communications,article; attention network; biology; conceptual framework; deep learning; early warning system; heuristics; learning algorithm; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; probability; quantitative analysis; signal processing; topology,"Grassia, M.

A comparative analysis reveals that upper-middle-income and high-income countries do receive stability benefits from MPIs. However, low and lower-middle-income economies show unintended instability costs in connection with MPIs, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach to macroprudential regulations is not beneficial.

"Cao, Y.",Measuring systemic risk and dependence structure between real estates and banking sectors in china using a covar-copula method,"The aim of this paper is to study the dependence structure between the real estate and the banking sectors in China. Various time-varying symmetric and asymmetric copula functions of the elliptical and Archimedean families are used to model the underlying dependence structure. Furthermore, it analyses risk spillover effects between these two sectors by quantifying three risk measures, namely, the value at risk (VaR), the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and the delta conditional value at risk (ΔCoVaR). Over the period from January 2005 to March 2019, the empirical show that there exists evidence of significant and symmetric dependence structure between these two sectors and Student'scopulas best capture this dependence. Moreover, we find that there are significant risk spillover effects from the real estate to the banking sectors, and vice versa. By considering different periods of financial distress, the empirical show that risk spillover effects during the 2015 2016 Chinese stock market turbulence period are much significant than that during the 2007 2008 global financial crisis. Furthermore, the statistical tests show that the real estate sector contributes significantly to systemic risk of the banking sector, and vice versa.

"Galán, J.E.; Mencía, J.",Model-based indicators for the identification of cyclical systemic risk,"The credit-to-GDP gap, as proposed by the Basel methodology, is the reference measure for the activation of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer. However, most of the countries implementing this instrument in recent years are not following its signals due to the large downward biases that it is presenting after the last financial crisis that do not reflect properly the current macrofinancial environment. In this context, credit gap measures that incorporate economic fundamentals may provide more accurate signals of cyclical systemic risk. We propose two alternative model-based indicators that account for these factors. We assess their performance using time series data from the 1970s for six European countries and compare them to the Basel gap. We find that our proposed models provide more accurate early warning signals of the build-up of cyclical systemic risk than the Basel gap, as well as lower biases after rapid changes in fundamentals. Furthermore, we identify the model specifications that are optimal for each of the countries considered. Our flexible approach can easily accommodate national specificities, which are key to maximize the performance of the models. 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2021-01-01,2,Empirical Economics,credit imbalances; credit provision; cyclical systemic risk; early warning models; economic policy; europe; financial crisis; gross domestic product; macroprudential policy; model-based indicators; performance assessment; time series analysis,"Galán, J.E.

Then, it measures the information spillover direction and degree among the global new energy companies for the two systems, furthermore, exploring the rolling-windows estimating method to investigate the time-varying characteristics of the information spillover mechanism. It selects 20 large energy companies with a weighting greater than 1.24% from the NEX index and obtains the weekly stock prices for these companies from November 24, 2006 to January 4, 2019. Some new findings can be obtained: (1) The total information spillover degree among the global new energy companies is very high, especially for the volatility system. (2) The static and dynamic asymmetry indexes confirm the existence of asymmetric effect for the information transmission mechanism, which shows that the bad news does contribute more to the systemic risk of global new energy company stock market than the good news. (3) Some new energy companies act as net information transmitters, which are relatively important in the networks. These new findings could provide a reference for investors in the new energy sector to develop specific portfolios and risk management, as well as advise relevant policy makers. 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2021-01-01,34,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,asymmetric analyse; asymmetric analysis; connectedness network; dynamic spillover; dynamics; energy companies; financial markets; information spillovers; investments; new energies; new energy companies; new energy company; risk management; rolling window; systems networks; volatility spillovers,"Geng, J.-B.

"Renn, O.",New challenges for risk analysis: systemic risks,"Systemic risks are a product of profound and rapid technological, economic and social changes associated with three major transformations. They are characterized by high complexity, trans-boundary effects, stochastic relationships, and nonlinear cause-effect patterns with tipping points and often associated with less public attention than they deserve. The full range of sys-temic risks from natural hazards to cybersecurity will be used to illustrate these characteristics and their implications. Due to these characteristics, systemic risks are overextending established risk management and creating new, unsolved challenges for policy making in risk governance. Their negative effects are often pervasive, impacting fields beyond the obvious primary areas of harm. The paper relates to an integrative risk concept including evaluation criteria, different risk classes and corresponding management strategies for the handling of systemic risks. The paper argues that a deliberative approach is needed for risk management and policy making in risk governance to prevent, mitigate or control systemic risks. 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2021,2021-01-01,24,Journal of Risk Research,decision making; evaluation criteria; high complexity; management strategies; natural hazard; risk analysis; risk assessment; risk governance; risk management; social changes; stakeholder involvement; stochastic systems; systemic risks; trans-boundary,"Renn, O.

This study is among the first few to use three different distance-to-risk measures to empirically assess the domestic interbank linkages and systemic contagion risk of the Chinese banking industry, by using bivariate dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model on data collected from eight prominent Chinese banks for the period 2006 2018. The show a relatively high correlation among almost all the banks, suggesting an interconnectedness among the banks.

Methods: In this prospective study, 120 β-thalassemia major patients received complete ophthalmic examinations (best-corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, and indirect ophthalmoscopy) and retinal imaging using color fundus photography and fundus autofluorescence imaging. Patients were grouped according to the presence of thalassemia-related retinal changes. The association between systemic risk factors (age, type and duration of iron chelator use, history of splenectomy, hemoglobin level, and ferritin level) and thalassemia-related retinal changes was investigated using logistic regression analysis.Thalassemia-related retinal changes were identified in 36.7% of patients. Several distinct retinal changes were observed, including retinal refractile bodies in 10% of patients and retinal hemorrhage in 5.8% of patients. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed abnormal patterns in 36.3% of patients with thalassemia-related retinal changes and 18.4% of patients without thalassemia-related retinal changes. Age (odds ratio OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval CI 1.03 1.18) and ferritin level (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 1.33) were associated with thalassemia-related retinal changes. Conclusion: Novel retinal changes were observed in β-thalassemia major patients.

"Bridget, D.M.",Now is the time to redefine safety in healthcare,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare workers around the globe provided exceptional patient care despite fears of infection, shortages of staff and supplies, and the frustrations of trying to treat a novel pathogen. At the same time, COVID-19 exposed deep and systemic risks to healthcare team members’ physical, psychological, and emotional safety driving burnout to crisis levels. Burnout is arising not only from the emotional toll of caring for sick and dying patients, but COVID-19 also exposed flaws in our health system and infrastructure. Systemic inequities were amplified as COVID-19 disproportionately impacted people of colour and Indigenous community members. A renewed and expanded definition of safety is needed to restore trust, recruit, and retain individuals to the healing professions, enable care to be provided with the greatest skill and humanity, and ensure the well-being of every person working in healthcare. In collaboration with CEOs of a diverse group of health systems in the United States, the author drafted a Declaration of Principles that expands the definition of safety to include safeguarding psychological and emotional well-being of team members, promoting health justice by declaring equity and anti-racism as core components of safety, and ensuring physical safety, which includes a zero-harm program to eliminate workplace violence, both physical and verbal. We invite Canadian leaders to embrace these concepts and commit to supporting team member safety and well-being as an essential foundation for public health.

Wicked problems reflect our incomplete understanding of interdependent global systems and the systemic risk they pose such problems escape solutions because they are often ill-defined, and thus mis-identified and under-appreciated by communities of problem-solvers. While there are well-documented benefits to tackling boundary-crossing problems from various viewpoints, the integration of diverse approaches can nevertheless contribute confusion around the collective understanding of the core concepts and feasible solutions. We explore this paradox by analyzing the development of both scholarly (social) and topical (cognitive) communitiestwo facets of knowledge production studies here that contribute towards the evolution of knowledge in and around a problem, termed a knowledge trajectoryassociated with three wicked problems: deforestation, invasive species, and wildlife trade. We posit that saturation in the dynamics of social and cognitive diversity growth is an indicator of reduced uncertainty in the evolution of the comprehensive knowledge trajectory emerging around each wicked problem. Informed by comprehensive bibliometric data capturing both social and cognitive dimensions of each problem domain, we thereby develop a framework that assesses the stability of knowledge trajectory dynamics as an indicator of wickedness associated with conceptual and solution uncertainty.

"Bluher, A.; Kawai, K.; Wang, A.; Stiles, D.; Licameli, G.",Obesity as a possible risk factor for pediatric sensorineural hearing loss,"Hypothesis: Childhood hearing loss impacts linguistic, academic, social, and psychologic development, and may have lasting implications for future workforce performance. Current evidence for obesity as a pediatric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) risk factor is intriguing but equivocal. We hypothesized that obesity is associated with a higher risk of SNHL. We additionally examined whether underweight is associated with a higher risk of SNHL. Study Design: Retrospective database review. Methods: A single-institution audiologic database from 2015 to 2020 was queried for audiograms with type-A tympanograms from children agedto 18 years old. Comorbidities known to be associated with hearing loss were excluded. We then examined both for sub-clinical15 dB) high- or low-frequency hearing loss, and for clinical21 dB) hearing loss, with the aim of examining the association between obesity and SNHL. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism.A total of 3,142 children were included. Obesity was not associated with risk of SNHL (adjusted OR 0.82 95% CI: 0.60, 1.12). Underweight children had a higher risk of SNHL than normal weight children (adjusted OR 1.78 95% CI: 1.08, 2.95). Autism was significantly associated with increased risk of sub-clinical SNHL only (adjusted OR 2.00 95% CI 1.34, 2.98).No association was found between obesity and pediatric SNHL. Underweight children may represent a higher-risk population for SNHL. There appears to be an increasing risk of SNHL as children approach adolescence. Further study of systemic risk factors for SNHL is indicated.

"Tanke, L.B.; Chodnicki, K.D.; Olsen, T.W.; Bhatti, M.T.; Chen, J.J.","Population-based incidence of ocular neovascularization following central retinal artery occlusion in olmsted county, minnesota","Purpose: To determine the population-based incidence of ocular neovascularization (NV) following central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and systemic risk factors associated with its development. Methods: Diagnosis of CRAO between January 1, 1976, and September 9, 2016, was identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a medical records linkage system for all medical care provided to residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota. Records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of CRAO, and data were collected on ocular NV and associated systemic diseases.There were 89 patients with CRAO. Subsequent ocular neovascularization developed in 14 (16%) patients. Neovascularization of the iris (NVI) was present in14 (64%) of these patients, neovascularization of the angle (NVA) in 10 14 (71%), neovascularization of the disc (NVD) in14 (14%), and neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) in14 (7%). Of these 14 patients with NV,(64%) developed neovascular glaucoma (NVG). The mean time from CRAO diagnosis to NV was 82 days (range 22 to 268 days). Excluding the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or CRAO caused by CRVO, the mean time to NV diagnosis was 80 days and the shortest time to NV diagnosis was 22 days. Diabetes mellitus was present in 64% of those with NV compared to 23% of those without NV (P 0.003). Conclusion: The population-based incidence of ocular neovascularization following CRAO is 16% and developed withinmonths in half the cohort. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for NV complications. 2021 Tanke et al.",2021,2021-01-01,0,Clinical Ophthalmology,acetazolamide; adult; aged; angle neovascularization; antiglaucoma agent; article; brain angiography; carotid artery obstruction; central retina artery occlusion; central retinal artery occlusion; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; coronary artery disease; cryoablation; diabetes mellitus; disc neovascularization; echography; female; fluorescence angiography; gonioscopy; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; icd-10; icd-9; intraocular pressure; iris neovascularization; magnetic resonance angiography; major clinical study; male; medical care; middle aged; minnesota; multicenter study; neovascular glaucoma; neovascularization (pathology); ocular neovascularization; optical coherence tomography; paracentesis; population research; retrospective study; risk factor; vasculotropin inhibitor; very elderly,"Tanke, L.B.

Whereas optimal oral health prior to initiate pARs is recognized as critically important for minimizing ONJ risk, the efficacy of preventive maintenance measures in patients who are taking pARs is understudied. Rice rats fed a standard diet (STD), rich in insoluble fiber, develop localized periodontitis. STD-rats with localized periodontitis treated with ZOL for 18 24 wk develop ONJ. Hence, we hypothesized that controlling preventing localized periodontitis in the ZOL-treated rats, reduces ONJ occurrence. Methods: We used two approaches to attempt reducing periodontitis prevalence: 1) periodontal cleaning (PC) and 2) replacing the STD-diet with a nutritionally-equivalent diet high in soluble fiber (SF). 75 four-week-old male rats were weight-randomized into five groups (n 15) in a 24-week experiment. Three groups ate the STD-diet and two the high SF-diet. STD-diet groups received intravenous (IV) vehicle (VEH) q4wks (STD VEH), 80 μg kg ZOL q4wks IV (STD ZOL), or ZOL plus PC q2wks (STD ZOL PC). The SF-diet groups received VEH (SF VEH) or ZOL (SF ZOL). Jaws were processed for histopathology and evaluated for ONJ prevalence and tissue-level periodontitis.1) 40% of STD VEH rats developed maxillary localized periodontitis with no ONJ 2) 50% of STD ZOL rats developed ONJ 3) 7% of STD ZOL PC rats developed ONJ (p 0.01 vs. STD ZOL) and 4) one SF ZOL rat developed localized periodontitis, and no SF VEH or SF ZOL rats developed ONJ (p 0.001 vs. STD ZOL).1) Periodontal cleaning in ZOL-treated rats decreases localized periodontitis severity and reduces ONJ prevalence and 2) feeding a SF-diet to ZOL-treated rats reduces both incidence of localized periodontitis and ONJ.

"Scalco, P.R.; Tabak, B.M.; Teixeira, A.M.",Prudential measures and their adverse effects on bank competition: the case of brazil,"After the 2008 2009 financial crisis, there was an increase in prudential measures to limit banking and systemic risk in several countries. The empirical studies related to this topic have focused, in general, on assessing the effectiveness of such instruments. This article addresses the associated costs (adverse effects) of these prudential measures on banking competition. We use a novel approach that employs a stochastic frontier model to measure Brazilian banks' mark-up and estimate the impact of prudential measures on market power. Our suggest that the tightening of prudential measures increases banks’ mark-up and, consequently, has a negative impact on banking competition. Our finding suggests that financial regulators should consider this adverse effect when designing regulations to promote financial stability without harming competition in the banking system. 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2021-01-01,4,Economic Modelling,bank regulation; lerner index; market power; prudential measures; stochastic frontier,"Scalco, P.R.

"Poledna, S.; Martínez-Jaramillo, S.; Caccioli, F.; Thurner, S.",Quantification of systemic risk from overlapping portfolios in the financial system,"Financial markets create endogenous systemic risk, the risk that a substantial fraction of the system ceases to function and collapses. Systemic risk can propagate through different mechanisms and channels of contagion. One important form of financial contagion arises from indirect interconnections between financial institutions mediated by financial markets. This indirect interconnection occurs when financial institutions invest in common assets and is referred to as overlapping portfolios. In this work we quantify systemic risk from indirect interconnections between financial institutions. Complete information of security holdings of major Mexican financial intermediaries and the ability to uniquely identify securities in their portfolios, allows us to represent the Mexican financial system as a bipartite network of securities and financial institutions. This makes it possible to quantify systemic risk arising from overlapping portfolios. We show that focusing only on direct interbank exposures underestimates total systemic risk levels by up to 50% under the assumptions of the model. By representing the financial system as a multi-layer network of direct interbank exposures (default contagion) and indirect external exposures (overlapping portfolios) we estimate the mutual influence of different channels of contagion. The method presented here is the first quantification of systemic risk on national scales that includes overlapping portfolios. 2020 The Authors",2021,2021-01-01,30,Journal of Financial Stability,financial networks; financial regulation; multi-layer networks; overlapping portfolios; systemic risk,"Poledna, S.

"Novakov, V.B.; Novakova, O.N.; Churnosov, M.I.",Risk factors and molecular entities of the etiopathogenesis of the knee osteoarthritis (literature review),"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogenic group of disorders of different etiology with similar biological, morphological and clinical manifestations and outcomes. OA is now considered a disease of the whole joint, including alterations in the articular cartilage, subchondral bone, synovial membrane, ligaments, capsule and periarticular muscles. OA of the knee as the most commonly affected joint accounts for the great medical, medical, social and economic impact. Material and methods A literature review assessing Russian and foreign studies on molecular mechanisms of etiology and pathogenesis of knee OA identified a set of factors for which there was consistent evidence for their association with onset of knee OA. A search of studies published in Russian and in English for the last ten years was conducted using bibliographic databases, including PubMed, PubMedCentral, GoogleScholar, eLIBRARY. Search terms included 'knee osteoarthritis', 'etiology', 'pathogenesis', 'risk factors'. Review of the literature showed that patients with knee OA are characterized by changes in cartilage, subchondral bone, synovium, suggesting common mechanisms of joint degeneration during OA development. Osteoarthritis (OA) is multifactorial in origin and closely associated with a wide spectrum of local (previous injury, muscle weakness, knee malalignment, knee surgeries, abnormal mechanical loading, excessive high impact sports, occupational physical activities) and systemic risk factors (advanced age, female sex, height, greater body mass index and obesity, hormone status, family history, mineral bone density, vitamindeficiency, ethnicity). The prevalence of the knee OA and patterns of joint involvement vary among different racial and ethnic groups. Conclusion The literature review allowed us to identify the molecular mechanisms of etiopathogenesis of knee OA and the major risk factors for the pathology.

"Abuzayed, B.; Al-Fayoumi, N.",Risk spillover from crude oil prices to GCC stock market returns: new evidence during the COVID-19 outbreak,"In this study, we examine oil price extreme tail risk spillover to individual Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets and quantify this spillover's shift before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive heteroscedastic (DCC- GARCH) model is employed to estimate three important measures of tail dependence risk: conditional value at risk (CoVaR), delta CoVaR (ΔCoVaR), and marginal expected shortfall (MES). Using daily data from January 2017 until May 2020, point to significant systemic oil risk spillover in all GCC stock markets. In particular, the effect of oil price systemic risk on GCC stock market returns was significantly larger during COVID-19 than before the pandemic. Upon splitting COVID-19 into two phases based on severity, we identify Saudi Arabia as the only GCC market to have experienced significantly higher exposure to oil risk in Phase 1. Although all GCC stock markets received greater oil systemic risk spillover in Phaseof COVID-19, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appeared more vulnerable to oil extreme risk than other countries. Our empirical findings reveal that investors should carefully consider the extreme oil risk effects on GCC stock markets when designing optimal portfolio strategies, minimizing portfolio risk, and adopting dynamic diversification process.

"Mandel, A.; Tiggeloven, T.; Lincke, D.; Koks, E.; Ward, P.; Hinkel, J.",Risks on global financial stability induced by climate change: the case of flood risks,"There is increasing concern among financial regulators that changes in the distribution and frequency of extreme weather events induced by climate change could pose a threat to global financial stability. We assess this risk, for the case of floods, by developing a simple model of the propagation of climate-induced shocks through financial networks. We show that the magnitude of global risks is determined by the interplay between the exposure of countries to climate-related natural hazards and their financial leverage. Climate change induces a shift in the distribution of impacts towards high-income countries and thus larger amplification of impacts as the financial sectors of high-income countries are more leveraged. Conversely, high-income countries are more exposed to financial shocks. In high-end climate scenarios, this could lead to the emergence of systemic risk as total impacts become commensurate with the capital of the banking sectors of countries that are hubs of the global financial network. Adaptation policy, or the lack thereof, appears to be one of the key risk drivers as it determines the future exposure of high-income countries. This implies in particular that the avoided costs in terms of financial stability should be weighted in as benefits of adaptation policy. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2021,2021-01-01,9,Climatic Change,adaptation policies; adaptive management; banking; banking sectors; climate change; climate impacts; climate models; climate scenarios; cost analysis; extreme event; extreme weather events; finance; financial networks; financial sectors; financial stability; financial system; flood frequency; flood risks; floods; natural hazard; risk assessment; risk perception; simple modeling,"Mandel, A.

"Matyska, B.","Salience, systemic risk and spectral risk measures as capital requirements","This paper evaluates the effectiveness of macroprudential capital requirements in the form of market risk measures in alleviating systemic risk, fire sales, and welfare losses in crisis resolution. We develop a general equilibrium, heterogeneous agent model with financial institutions subject to risk-based capital requirement constraint and compare the benchmark Value at Risk to three spectral risk measures. The key idea of alternative regulation is probability weighting, by which regulators overweight outcomes that are salient to them relative to their probabilities. We show that prudential instruments based on solely overweighting of tail market losses are preferable for policymakers aiming to reduce the likelihood of systemic crises. Overweighting both the downside and upside risks increases household welfare, but in the financial sector's risk-seeking preferences and exacerbates the systemic risk. The suggest that overweighting worst-case and best-case outcomes can prevent fire sales, while overweighting intermediate outcomes leads to welfare improvements of the financial sector after uncertainty shocks. 2021",2021,2021-01-01,0,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,capital requirements; macroprudential regulation; probability weighting; spectral risk measures; systemic risk,"Matyska, B.

"Tarbert, H.P.",Self-regulation in the derivatives markets: stability through collaboration,"Sound financial regulation does not require choosing between governmental and private action. Instead, optimal regulatory solutions often blend the expertise and adaptability of private-sector influence with the stabilizing effects of federal oversight. This collaborative framework has a rich history in U.S. derivatives regulation, which has long relied on self-regulatory organizationsSROslike exchanges, clearinghouses, and the National Futures Association to help promote market stability and customer protection. SROs remain subject to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading CommissionCFTC ), which guards against the proverbial fox-in-the-henhouse scenario while advancing quintessential government functions like mitigating systemic risk. The advantages of this self-regulatory framework were underscored in 2020, when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spurred unprecedented volatility across U.S. derivatives markets. Effectively navigating the market effects of the pandemic required a calibrated approach that drew from the advantages of SROs and the CFTC. The integrated response that emerged is a model for how SROs and the CFTC can together promote stability through collaboration. 2021 by Heath P.

The show evidence of a negative and positive average dependence between energy (crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) and almost all MENA stock markets before and after the oil crash in the short term. In the long term, we find a significant average dependence before the crash and an upper tail dependence after the crash between crude oil and almost all the MENA stock markets. Natural gas exhibits a positive and upper tail dependence with almost all MENA markets before the crash and an average dependence after the crash. For gasoline, the however are mixed for the average and tail dependence before and after the crash. Furthermore, the dependence is higher in the long than the short term and after the oil crash than before it. The VaR and CoVaR values show that the expected loss of portfolios is more significant after the crash and in the long term.

The present study was designed using emergent, floating and submerged macrophytic plants in a systematic approach. The study was evaluated with several components such as plants (water hyacinth, water lettuce and water thymes), aeration (supply of oxygen), and physical adsorption (activated carbon). Domestic wastewater collected from the local effluent treatment plant was treated individually and by combining all the components. Diverse experimental setups viz., lake sediment (control reactor), aeration, activated carbon blocks, water hyacinth, water lettuce, and water thymes were individually studied. Further the above components were combined, such as lake sediment aeration activated carbon blocks with plants like water hyacinth, water lettuce, and water thymes. The study inferred along with phytoremediation, and the external factors enhanced the treatment performances. Water hyacinth documented enhanced chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 85.71%, followed by water lettuce (80%), and water thymes (77.14%) along with the plants, both aeration, and activated carbon had stimulated the wastewater treatment. The highest removal efficiency of nitrate (70.23%), phosphate (63.64%), and sulphate (61.16%) were observed in water hyacinth due to its thick roots, and fibrous tissues reported effective treatment. The study hypothesized that these processes could be an effective strategy to restore the lakes and regulate the environmental flow. The study infers that an ecological engineering system symbiotically enables to self-organize the ecosystem within the boundary. 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2021-01-01,10,Journal of Environmental Management,"activated carbon; adsorption; aeration; aquatic macrophytes; araceae; article; biodegradation, environmental; bioremediation; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; dissolved oxygen; domestic waste; ecological engineering; ecosystem; ecosystem restoration; effluent; eichhornia; eichhornia crassipes; emergent plants; energy resource; engineering; hydraulic retention time; lacustrine deposit; lake sediment; lake water; lettuce; macrophyte; nitrate; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; phosphate; phytoremediation; pistia stratiotes; plant growth; restoration of lakes; rhizosphere; self-purification; solar energy; submerged vegetation; sulfate; sustainability; thyme; trophic conditions; turbidity; waste component removal; waste water; waste water management; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water insecurity; water management; water pollutant; water pollutants, chemical; water purification; water scarcity; water stress","Selvaraj, D.

"Acemoglu, D.; Ozdaglar, A.; Siderius, J.; Tahbaz-Salehi, A.",Systemic credit freezes in financial lending networks,"This paper develops a network model of interbank lending, in which banks decide to extend credit to their potential borrowers. Borrowers are subject to shocks that may force them to default on their loans. In contrast to much of the previous literature on financial networks, we focus on how anticipation of future defaults may result in ex ante credit freezes, whereby banks refuse to extend credit to one another. We first characterize the terms of the interbank contracts and the patterns of interbank lending that emerge in equilibrium. We then study how shifts in the distribution of shocks can result in complex credit freezes that travel throughout the network. We use this framework to analyze the effects of various policy interventions on systemic credit freezes. 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,2021-01-01,3,Mathematics and Financial Economics,contagion; counterparty risk; credit freezes; endogenous financial networks; systemic risk,"Acemoglu, D.

"Dziwok, E.; Karaś, M.A.",Systemic illiquidity noise based measure a solution for systemic liquidity monitoring in frontier and emerging markets,"The paper presents an alternative approach to measuring systemic illiquidity applicable to countries with frontier and emerging financial markets, where other existing methods are not applicable. We develop a novel Systemic Illiquidity Noise (SIN) based measure, using the Nelson Siegel Svensson methodology in which we utilize the curve fitting error as an indicator of financial system illiquidity. We empirically apply our method to a set of 10 divergent Central and Eastern Europe countries Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia in the period of 2006 2020. The show three periods of increased risk in the sample period: the global financial crisis, the European public debt crisis, and the COVID 19 pandemic. They also allow us to identify three divergent sets of countries with different systemic liquidity risk characteristics. The analysis also illustrates the impact of the of the euro on systemic illiquidity risk. The proposed methodology may be of consequence for financial system regulators and macroprudential bodies: it allows for contemporaneous monitoring of discussed risk at a minimal cost using well known models and easily accessible data. 2021 by the authors.

"Yang, L.; Hamori, S.",Systemic risk and economic policy uncertainty: international evidence from the crude oil market,"The causal relationship between systemic risk and global economic policy uncertainty remains unexplored, even though the latter serves as an important factor in asset pricing and macroeconomic forecasting. This study extends Adrian and Brunnermeier's (2016) framework, combining it with mixed data sampling (MIDAS) to calculate the systemic risk in the crude oil market based on monthly frequencies. We employ Diebold and Yilmaz's (2009, 2014) connectedness measures to identify the causal relationship between systemic risk in the crude oil market and global economic policy uncertainty. We find that global economic policy uncertainty is economically significant in determining systemic risk, although its role weakens during financial crises. In other words, less disagreement in economic policies may decrease systemic risk. Therefore, both policymakers and financial practitioners should be aware of the causality changes and increasing connectedness within the system and make decisions accordingly. 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",2021,2021-01-01,16,Economic Analysis and Policy,causality; connectedness; crude oil; economic policy uncertainty; systemic risk,"Yang, L.

"Johannsdottir, L.; Cook, D.; Arruda, G.M.",Systemic risk of cruise ship incidents from an arctic and insurance perspective,"Easier accessibility and demand for so-called last chance tourism has contributed to rapid growth in Arctic cruise ship tourism. Arctic cruising brings many benefits to remote coastal communities but also presents an array of risks. In the light of this context, this article explores the concept of systemic risk of cruise ship incidents in general, findings which are then placed in an Arctic context and consideration given of the role the insurance sector may play in addressing cruise ship incidents. The study is based on metadata, both from academic and nonacademic sources. Findings are drawn from 11 global case studies of cruise ship incidents,of which are polar examples. In the worst-case scenario, an array of serious economic, business, environmental, sociocultural, and security impacts may unfold in the Arctic, presenting risks that may be considerably worse than in other parts of the world. Arctic-specific challenges include extreme weather conditions and the presence of sea-ice, navigation and communication conditions, and lack of infrastructure (port facilities, Search and Rescue capabilities). Significant knowledge gaps across the Arctic have been identified, for example, in terms of seabed mapping, how to deal with industry-related activities, and the risks and nature of environmental change. When cruise ship risks in the Arctic are considered, both passenger and shipowner risk need to be accounted for, including Search and Rescue cover. Although data are limited, there is evidence that the sociocultural risks of an Arctic cruise ship incident are insufficiently addressed, either via insurance mechanisms or cross-border, navigational safety guidelines such as the Polar Code. The academic contribution of the study is the systemic scale of the analysis, and the practical and political implications are to lay the foundation for solution discussion that is of relevance in an Arctic and insurance context. 2015 Dares.

"Abuzayed, B.; Bouri, E.; Al-Fayoumi, N.; Jalkh, N.",Systemic risk spillover across global and country stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Uncovering the tail risk spillover among global financial markets helps provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information transmission in extreme market conditions such as the COVID-19 outbreak. In this paper, we examine systemic distress risk spillover between the global stock market and individual stock markets in the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using two important measures of tail dependence risk: conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and delta conditional VaR (ΔCoVaR), we apply the bivariate dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) conditional autoregressive heteroscedastic (GARCH) model. The empirical reveal that bivariate systemic risk contagion between the global stock market and each individual stock market evolved during the sample period and intensified as COVID-19 spread worldwide. During the COVID-19 period, the developed markets in Europe and North America transmitted and received more marginal extreme risk to and from the entire global market than Asian stock markets. Further analysis involving the connectedness among the value at risk (VaR) series of the sampled stock market indices and the global stock index, shows a high degree of integration in the extreme downside risk of the stock market system, especially during the COVID-19 period. These findings offer practical implications for regulators, policymakers, and portfolio risk managers during the unprecedented uncertainty period provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",2021,2021-01-01,69,Economic Analysis and Policy,connectedness; covar; covid-19; stock markets; systemic risk; δcovar,"Abuzayed, B.

"Pichler, A.; Poledna, S.; Thurner, S.",Systemic risk-efficient asset allocations: minimization of systemic risk as a network optimization problem,"Systemic risk is a multi-layer network phenomenon. Layers represent various types of direct financial exposure of various types, including interbank liabilities and derivative- or foreign exchange exposures. An important layer of systemic risk emerges through common asset holdings of financial institutions. Strongly overlapping portfolios lead to similar exposures that are caused by price movements of the underlying financial assets. Based on the knowledge of individual portfolio holdings of financial agents, we quantify the systemic risk of overlapping portfolios. We then present an optimization procedure whereby we minimize the systemic risk in a given financial market by optimally rearranging overlapping portfolio networks. The optimization is performed under the constraints that the expected returns and risk of the individual portfolios are unchanged. We explicitly demonstrate the power of the method on the overlapping portfolio network of sovereign exposure between major European banks, using data from the European Banking Authority stress test of 2016. Systemic risk can be reduced by more than a factor of two, without any detrimental effects for the individual banks. These are confirmed by a simple simulation of fire sales in the government bond market. In particular, we show that the contagion probability is dramatically reduced in the optimized network. We comment on the efficiency of the network optimization approach in comparison to equity-injection-based ways to reduce systemic risk. To obtain the same risk levels that are obtained in the network optimization, it would be necessary to increase the actual available capital by two thirds. This shows the immense potential of network-based systemic risk management. 2020",2021,2021-01-01,13,Journal of Financial Stability,contagion; debtrank; financial networks; government bonds; network optimization; overlapping portfolios; quadratic programming; systemic risk; systemic risk-efficient,"Pichler, A.

The chapter looks at the wide range of macroprudential measures adopted at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, and considers whether they would be appropriate also in the longer term as economies focus more on safety. The chapter considers the magnitude of the green transition, and the financial vulnerabilities throughout the process. It argues that the region’s economy would be protected by having a single agency with oversight over all the range of direct, and indirect, financial risks in Europe that agency would be the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).

"Bryan, A.",The dominating effects of economic crises,"This article argues that economic crises are incompatible with the realisation of non-domination in capitalist societies. The ineradicable risk that an economic crisis will occur undermines the robust security of the conditions of non-domination for all citizens, not only those who are harmed by a crisis.begin by demonstrating that the unemployment caused by economic crises violates the egalitarian dimensions of freedom as non-domination. The lack of employment constitutes an exclusion from the social bases of self-respect, and from a practice of mutual social contribution crucial to the intersubjective affirmation of one’s status. While this argument shows that republicans must be concerned about economic crises,suggest a more powerful argument can be grounded in the republican requirement that freedom must be robust. The systemic risk of economic crisis constitutes a threat to the conditions of free citizenship that cannot be nullified using policy mechanisms. As a result, republicans appear to be faced with the choice of revising their commitments or rejecting the possibility that republican freedom can be robustly secured in capitalist societies. 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2021,2021-01-01,4,Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy,capitalism; economic crisis; freedom; non-domination; republicanism,"Bryan, A.

Rather than identifying risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter related thrombosis, exploring the effect of these risk factors might be a promising method to improve the outcomes of thrombosis. s: To analyze the effect of systemic and local risk factors on triggering peripherally inserted central catheter related thrombosis in the first two weeks post insertion in cancer patients. Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: The study was conducted at a 4500-bed university-affiliated medical center in China. Participants: One hundred seventy-three cancer patients with peripherally inserted central catheters were included. Methods: Peripherally inserted central catheter related thrombosis was assessed using ultrasound at a series of timepoints, once every two days post insertion. Data on age, body mass index, blood hypercoagulation, insertion attempts, catheter-to-vein ratio, and blood flow velocity were collected as risk factors. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling were used to describe the study samples and analyze the effects of systemic and local risk factors.Among the 173 cancer patients included, 126 (72.8%) patients were diagnosed with peripherally inserted central catheter related thrombosis. Most thromboses (n 118, 93.7%) were detected within five days, and 100% were detected within nine days post insertion. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that local risk factors catheter-to-vein ratio (standardized path coefficient 0.32,0.05) and blood flow velocity (standardized path coefficient 0.35,0.05) had a greater effect than systemic factors age (standardized path coefficient 0.13,0.05) and blood hypercoagulation (standardized path coefficient 0.17,0.05) on triggering peripherally inserted central catheter related thrombosis. Conclusion: Peripherally inserted central catheter related thrombosis is quite common and can occur very early post insertion in cancer patients. Among the common risk factors, local risk factors reflecting peripherally inserted central catheter technology itself had a greater effect than systemic risk factors reflecting predisposition to thrombosis.

Using a sample of 314 listed firms in Dhaka stock Exchange (DSE), this study employed the event study methodology (ESM) to find any abnormal return (AR) associated to the first COVID-19 detection announcement. Three different return models namely mean-adjusted return, market-adjusted return and market model have been used to calculate the abnormal return and test the statistical significance using both parametric crude dependence and standardised cross-sectional T-test along with non-parametric generalised sign-test and Corrado rank-test. The findings suggest that, despite the perceived weak market efficiency, the announcement of the first COVID-19 detection has a significant negative impact on overall market return on the event day. Additionally, the result exhibits the indifferent market reaction of different industry segments such as manufacturing, service, financial, non-financial, pharmaceuticals and IT and telecommunication sectors.

"Wolf, I.; Caridad, L.; del, R.L.",The expectation for pension insurance in funded schemes: theoretical model and global implementation,"In this study, we derive the financial position of pension actors in the market during pension system transition toward more funded capitalized scheme, mainly via an option benefit model. This is enabled by not considering the economy as a single earning cohort. We analytically demonstrate a socio-economic anomaly in funded pension system, which is in favor of high earning cohorts on the expense of low earning cohorts. This anomaly is realized by lack of insurance and exposure to financial and systemic risks. Furthermore, the anomaly might lead to pension re-reform back to unfunded scheme, mostly due to political pressure. We find that minimum pension guarantee is a rebalance mechanism to this anomaly, which increases the probability to sustainable pension scheme. Specifically, we argue that implementing the guarantee with an intra-generational, risk-sharing mechanism is the most efficient way to reduce the effect of this abnormality. Moreover, we exhibit the convergence process toward implementing minimum pension guarantee in many countries, which have capitalized their pension systems during the last three decades, particularly among Latin America and Central East Europe (CEE) countries. 2021 Ishay Wolf and Lorena CaridadLopez del Rio.",2021,2021-01-01,1,Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies,defined contribution (dc); pay-as-you-go (payg); put option; social security,"Wolf, I.

This paper tests the impact of investors' behavior in the U.S. equity market. By using monthly data from February 2014 to December 2018, the impacts of investor sentiment are examined. Besides, Fama-French risk factors are investigated in a new multiple factor asset pricing model. Specifically, the investor sentiment is measured by six-variable composite index. Empirical indicate that the investor sentiment is a composition of systemic risk. In this case, the Fama-French three factor model with investor sentiment factor can fully explains the return of stocks in the USA stock market.

"Jimenez, J.; Azcona, J.M.L.",The phenomenon of de-risking: unintended consequences and possible solutions,"Global commerce relies on correspondent bank ing to execute international transactions. Due to the increasing cost of compliance, however, some US-based global financial institutions have been terminating their correspondent banking relationships a practice known as de-risking. In some cases, correspondent banks have even terminated their relationships with central banks. This kind of situation creates systemic risk at a country level, and central banks are looking at alternatives to better serve the needs of their respective financial systems. This paper anal yses prior work and surveys on the magnitude of de-risking, and cross-references the findings with recent surveys conducted in the Dominican Republic and Argentina to determine whether market failures and systemic risk are inevitable. The indicate that while the situation is not yet catastrophic, it is sufficiently precarious that foreign countries that rely on the US dollar should start looking for alternative solutions for global correspondent banking immediately. The paper also describes some of the alternatives currently available, including intervention from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, regional payments systems, and smaller US correspondents.

"Aquini, G.V.",The supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates: characteristics and challenges A superviscomplementar de conglomerados financeiros: caracter sticasdesafios,"Financial conglomerates pose a number of challenges from the point of view of prudential financial supervision. Their operations in the banking and investment sectors, as well as in the insurance sector, require great coordination among supervisory agencies not only at national level, but also from other EU member states and even third countries where they operate. The EU regulated their supervision for the first time in the Dir. 2002 87 CE, creating a supplementary supervision system, which was successively amended in 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2013. Dir. 2002 87 CE was transposed into Portuguese law by DL 145 2006, amended by DL 18 2013 and DL 91 2014. This article will expose the deficiencies in the transposition of European law into national law and point out some challenges to be faced in the future, such as the conflicts between the law of supplementary supervision and corporate law, the operation of shadow bankings, regulatory fragmentation and the need for coordination among a large number of regulatory agencies. 2022 Revista Juridica Portucalense.

"Chabay, I.; Renn, O.; Van, D.L.S.; Droy, S.",Transforming scholarship to co-create sustainable futures,"The critical challenge facing humanity is the increasingly urgent need to find and implement pathways that lead humankind into a new stage of dynamic equilibrium that promotes the co-evolution of natural and cultural systems. We address this challenge for scientific and scholarly research communities and the transformations in roles, resources, actors, and institutions of scholarship (encompassing natural and social sciences, humanities, and arts), which can contribute substantially and effectively to co-designing solutions for coping with unsustainable practices and systemic risks. Our perspective builds upon a series of four workshops to identify and address global sustainability challenges at a regional scale. It is anchored in the view that nature and society are inextricably interwoven, that planetary boundaries are fundamentally societal, rather than solely environmental issues, that viable solutions to the global challenges mentioned above can be developed and most effectively implemented at a regional to local scale in conjunction with substantive changes in the education systems at all levels, and that these considerations require a complex adaptive systems approach to seeking and implementing solutions. We call for rethinking, finding creative approaches, and acting to make scholarship more capable of effectively creating just and equitable sustainable futures in diverse cultures and contexts. 2021 Cambridge University Press.

"LI, H.-M.; WANG, X.-C.; ZHAO, X.-F.; QI, Y.",Understanding systemic risk induced by climate change,"The systemic risk induced by climate change represents one of the most prominent threats facing humanity and has attracted increasing attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019. The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk to conduct empirical research to assess future risks and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk. 2021 The Authors",2021,2021-01-01,16,Advances in Climate Change Research,climate change; disaster; risk assessment; systemic risk,"LI, H.-M.

There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. To forecast epidemics, classical approaches usually need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data-driven, parameter-free, geometric approach to access the emergence of a pandemic state by studying the Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci network curvatures. Discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those can provide analogous for COVID-19 epidemic time-series. We first compute both curvatures in a toy-model of epidemic time-series with delays, which allows us to create epidemic networks. We also compared our to classical network metrics. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures can be a parameter-free estimate for identifying a pandemic state in the simulated epidemic. On this basis, we then compute both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures for real epidemic networks built from COVID-19 epidemic time-series available at the World Health Organization (WHO). This approach allows us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of our method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for the pandemic state, regardless of parameter estimation and stochastic modelling. This work opens the possibility of using discrete geometry to study epidemic networks. 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.",2021,2021-01-01,2,Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment,computational biology; epidemic modelling; network dynamics; networks; random graphs,"Barros De Souza, D.

"Antoncic, M.",A paradigm shift in the board room: incorporating sustainability into corporate governance and strategic decision-making using big data and artificial intelligence,"In this paper, the author discusses the need to elevate sustainability to the scrutiny of the Board. Coronavirus disease-2019 and the lessons learned must nudge corporations to think and act more holistically about sustainability and incorporate sustainability into the fabric of the organisation. Each Board Committee must do its part in ensuring the company adopts a robust framework around sustainability. Equally important to reporting on sustainability issues and measuring and managing sustainability risk, is measuring and analysing a company’s sustainability reputational footprint’. Key Board Committees all need to understand the impact global macro systemic risks can have on the company and the impact the company can have on externalities which can affect its sustainability reputational footprint’. Boards need to ensure that every strategic decision is made through a sustainability lens. Not only will this enhance its societal impact but can be a key driver of performance. A strategic focus on sustainability at the Board level can be a source of competitive advantage. Boards need to measure and understand their sustainability reputational footprint’ and benchmark themselves against their peers. Using big data and artificial intelligence, a corporate Board could integrate sustainability data into its business model and strategic decisions to give it a competitive advantage vs its peers. Boards need to have sufficient fluency in the latest sustainability technology to apply advanced statistical, data-driven information to optimise their sustainability reputational footprint,’ which lowers their cost of capital and improves other financial metrics.

"Sakurai, Y.; Kurosaki, T.",A simulation analysis of systemic counterparty risk in over-the-counter derivatives markets,"In this paper, we propose a simulation framework to assess systemic risk in over-the-counter derivatives markets. We incorporate credit valuation adjustment (CVA), a mark-to-market estimate of counterparty credit risk booked on a bank’s balance sheet, into an otherwise standard structural model of credit risk. In this model, banks optimally hedge CVA by trading a credit default swap (CDS). The model aims to capture a possible adverse effect called CDS CVA feedback loop from CVA hedging, which could increase CDS spreads due to a lack of liquidity in CDS markets and even further increase CVA because CVA is valued using the default probability extracted from CDS spreads. In order to measure systemic counterparty credit risk, we aggregate CVA across banks and examine how the distribution of systemic counterparty credit risk changes depending on underlying model parameters. We document that the tail risk of CVA increases nonlinearly when the liquidity of CDS markets declines. As an extension, we also model cost of posting collateral and discuss the trade-off between reducing systemic counterparty credit risk, stability of CDS markets and collateral cost. 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2020-01-01,2,Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination,collateral management; feedback effects; margin requirement; mark-to-market accounting,"Sakurai, Y.

"Amelda, B.; Erna, B.S.; Jesselyn, N.A.",Analysis of early detection system of banking industry in indonesia on shock,"The emergence of technology or digitalization of fintech amid tight liquidity pressures and a slowdown in the global economy, greatly affects the performance of banks as intermediary institutions that are vulnerable to risk. However, if risks are left uncontrolled and not treated soon, they will create systemic risks that can create substantial costs. For this reason, early detection needs to be done in the context of prevention before a crisis occurs. This study aims to determine the level vulnerability of banking industry to the shocks and the bank's resilience profile to shocks in the midst of FinTech developments. The analytical method used in this study is logit regression, which starts with calculating indexation to measure the level of bank vulnerability to shocks. The data used in this study includes banks financial statements and macroeconomic data. The showed that exchange rate pressures and Non-Performing Loans had the largest contribution as the cause of bank vulnerability with a probability value of 2.363% and 2.006%.

"Schnabel, I.",Are banks finally resolvable A perspective from europe,"After the global financial crisis, policymakers in many countries promised that banks should never again be bailed out using taxpayers’ money. Therefore, new regulatory measures were introduced, most importantly new bank resolution regimes like the Single Resolution Mechanism in the euro area.

"Brunnermeier, M.; Rother, S.; Schnabel, I.",Asset price bubbles and systemic risk,"We analyze the relationship between asset price bubbles and systemic risk, using bank-level data covering almost 30 years. Banks’ systemic risk already rises during a bubble’s buildup and even more so during its bust. The increase in risk strongly differs across banks and by bubble. It depends on bank characteristics (especially bank size) and bubble characteristics and can become very large: in a median real estate bust, systemic risk increases by almost 70% of the median for banks with unfavorable characteristics. These emphasize the importance of bank-level factors in the buildup of financial fragility during bubble episodes. The Author(s) 2020.

"Badarau, C.; Lapteacru, I.","Bank risk, competition and bank connectedness with firms: A literature review","The outbreak of the 2007 2009 financial crisis and of the European sovereign debt crisis again raised questions about the vulnerability and the behaviour of banking institutions. The unconventional monetary policies that followed have flattened the yield curve and created a low interest rates environment. This can give rise to risk-taking behaviour from banks and can therefore undermine the stability of the banking system with negative impact of the credit supply, corporate investment and real economy. This article proposes a literature review on the main determinants of bank lending and risk-taking decisions, going through the competition in the banking market, the bank connectedness with firms and the role of monetary and banking authorities. The systemic risk concept is also discussed as well as its drivers and potential measures that should be monitored by prudential authorities in order to preserve financial stability. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2020-01-01,16,Research in International Business and Finance,bank connectedness with firms; bank risk; banking competition; systemic risk,"Badarau, C.

Design methodology approach: The whole analysis has been performed in the two steps, i.e. confirmatory factors analysis and structural equation modeling, to prove model fit between behavioral intention and actual behavior for using blockchain technology. Total 223 respondents have been selected, and the selection of the respondent is primarily on the basis of their previous experience with trading corporate equities. Findings: The study determines empirically all the mentioned relationships of attitude, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness with the behavioral intention as per the conceptual model to prove the relationship. The of the manuscript shows the model fit indexes for various constructs are prove the model fit as per the theorized model. The values of the various indexes are found to be under the permissible range which explains the relationship of various constructs based on the theorized model. Research limitations implications: Despite, the limitations in terms of selection of sampling methods, outcome and the interpretation, the proves the fit with the theoretical framework. The major implication is to understand the real-time use of blockchain technology for the transfer of shares from one party to other. Practical implications: Stakeholders in corporate governance namely customers, creditors, suppliers, community, employees, owners, investors, trade unions and social activists could benefit in different ways. Investors could benefit from being able to purchase equity at low price and to sell them into a market with greater liquidity, but they would found it difficult to camouflage their trades. Social implications: The study opines that virtually all aspects of the corporate governance can be improved through the adoption of this technology resulting in greater transparency, improved liquidity and lowering costs. Originality value: This study will be a reference for global players in the financial industry that have started investing in this innovative technology vis- -vis recent announcement of adoption of blockchain by global exchanges including NASDAQ, NYSE and Deutsche Borse, as a new method for trading, tracking ownership and monitoring systemic risk for strengthening corporate governance mechanism.

Quantile regression is employed to capture the nonlinear relationship between the systemic risk and the distribution of future macroeconomic shocks. We find that the systemic risk skews the distribution of future shocks, which cannot be identified in the central tendency analysis within the traditional linear regression. In particular, when the systemic risk builds up, the risk of severe economic downturns increases while the risk of moderate economic downturns barely changes. When comparing the forecasting power of different systemic risk measures, we use both a fixed rolling window and a time-varying method to make the result robust. We find that, of the 12 widely used measures,demonstrate significant predictability for subsequent shocks to economic growth in China and can thus serve as early warning signals. 2020",2020,2020-01-01,2,China Economic Review,economic growth; forecast; quantile regression; systemic risk,"Chen, G.

However, the ocular occlusive events might also influence a patient’s systemic condition. This study tried to investigate serum biomarkers associated with oxidative stress, before and after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (aVEGF) therapy in patients with RVOs. Methods: Newly-onset RVO patients were categorized into two groups: comorbid with macular edema requiring aVEGF therapy (treatment group) and no edema (observation group). Age and sex-matched patients (who received cataract surgery) were included as the control group. Intravitreal ranibizumab with a pro-re-nata regimen were administered. Serum samples were collected prior to treatment, atand 12 months after therapy observation and were collected once before controls who received cataract surgery. mRNA expression of sirtuin-1, its downstream genes, anti-oxidative biomarkers, and proinflammatory cytokines were measured.There were 32, 26, and 34 patients enrolled in the treatment, observation, and control groups, respectively. The expressions of sirtuin-1 and its downstream genes were significantly lower in patients with RVO compared with the control group. Sirtuin-1 gene expression increased afteryear of aVEGF therapy in the treatment group but remained unchanged in the observation group. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines were reduced afteryear of aVEGF therapy. These biomarkers remained with no changes in the observation group.Our study showed that the systemic oxidative stress increased in RVO patients. The aVEGF therapy could alter the gene expression of anti-oxidative proteins and reduce systemic oxidative stress in these patients. 2020 by the authors.

It elaborates upon a range of social sciences literatures, notably from criminology and political sciences, that have discussed various macro-level factors contributing to corruption, including market characteristics. Its most distinct contribution to the literature is in importing the concept of systemic risk-thus far chiefly examined in the financial regulation literature-to the analysis of corruption. It draws on the financial literature on systemic risk and macro-prudential regulation and supervision. In so doing, it elaborates upon concepts such as network and contagion as to theorise the effects of corruption on resource allocation.

"Monasterolo, I.",Climate change and the financial system,"The financial system could help achieve the global climate targets by aligning investments to sustainability. However, investors are largely exposed to carbon-intensive assets that could become stranded, thus delaying the low-carbon transition and bringing new sources of risk for financial stability, i.e., climate-related financial risks. Here, we discuss climate-related financial risks, the challenges they pose to traditional economic and financial risk assessment, and the implications for the implementation and feasibility of climate policies. We then present science-based approaches that introduce forward-looking climate risks and their deep uncertainty in financial risk management (e.g., via the climate value at risk, climate spread, climate stress-test). Finally, we present of applications aimed at pricing climate risks in investors' portfolios and calculating the largest losses that could lead to systemic risk, in collaboration with leading financial institutions.

Two hybrid models, namely the SWARCH-EVT-Copula and the Bivariate SWARCH-EVT models, are proposed and applied in order to take into account (A) the high low volatility regimes, (B) the interdependence structure inherited from the joint tail behaviours, as well as, (C) the risk spillover dynamics among financial sectors during market turmoils. We empirically show that the housing and stock markets share the strongest linkage and play central roles in the spreading of shocks. With a highly integrated system, the American financial sectors are under greater exposure to risk contagion and systemic risk during crises than the Chinese markets. Nevertheless, the exchange rate risk of Renminbi remains at an intensive level since its crawl-like arrangement and leads to increasing co-movements in the stock and interest rate markets since 2014. 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2020-01-01,10,North American Journal of Economics and Finance,c32; c38; contagion effect; evt; g01; g11; markov switching regime; vine copula,"Wang, P.

"Chiu, I.H.-Y.",Corporate governance of financial corporations,"This chapter critically discusses the relevance of conventional corporate governance paradigms for financial corporations, especially in the wake of the global financial crisis. Many banks that had apparently good systems of corporate governance according to conventional standards were financially impaired and criticised for having engaged in unchecked excessive risk-taking. Post-crisis reforms, especially those relating to regulation in the United Kingdom and the European Union, took the approach of directly regulating aspects of bank corporate governance including board responsibility, internal control functions, and bankers’ remuneration. However, these approaches are not extended to the general corporate sector as there are unique financial and incentive structures at financial corporations justifying such approaches, and the regulated financial corporations pose issues of systemic risk and public interest. The distinct regulatory regimes however still sit uneasily with conventional norms of shareholder-centred corporate governance, and this issue remains unresolved.

"Veraart, L.A.M.",Distress and default contagion in financial networks,"We develop a new model for solvency contagion that can be used to quantify systemic risk in stress tests of financial networks. In contrast to many existing models, it allows for the spread of contagion already before the point of default and hence can account for contagion due to distress and mark-to-market losses. We derive general ordering for outcome measures of stress tests that enable us to compare different contagion mechanisms. We use these to study the sensitivity of the new contagion mechanism with respect to its model parameters and to compare it to existing models in the literature. When applying the new model to data from the European Banking Authority, we find that the risk from distress contagion is strongly dependent on the anticipated recovery rate. For low recovery rates, the high additional losses caused by bankruptcy dominate the overall stress testFor high recovery rates, however, we observe a strong sensitivity of the stress test outcomes with respect to the model parameters determining the magnitude of distress contagion. 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2020,2020-01-01,14,Mathematical Finance,contagion; financial networks; mark-to-market losses; stress testing; systemic risk,"Veraart, L.A.M.

"Li, S.; Huang, Y.",Do cryptocurrencies increase the systemic risk of the global financial market,"The advance of cryptocurrencies has sparked wide concern over their interplay with the existing global financial market. This paper analyzes the risk spillover relation between cryptocurrencies and major financial assets, and unravels how cryptocurrencies could influence global financial systemic risk. We find that cryptocurrencies function as a separate risk source from traditional assets. Major legislative, financial and technological events in the cryptocurrency market may affect risk spillover dynamics. Although the overall penetration of cryptocurrencies is not yet deep, introducing cryptocurrency can significantly increase the systemic risk to traditional markets during low risk level episodes. 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",2020,2020-01-01,11,China and World Economy,cryptocurrency; dynamic risk spillover; e44; f36; g15; systemic risk,"Li, S.

"Ararat, Ç.; Rudloff, B.",Dual representations for systemic risk measures,"The financial crisis showed the importance of measuring, allocating and regulating systemic risk. Recently, the systemic risk measures that can be decomposed into an aggregation function and a scalar measure of risk, received a lot of attention. In this framework, capital allocations are added after aggregation and can represent bailout costs. More recently, a framework has been introduced, where institutions are supplied with capital allocations before aggregation. This yields an interpretation that is particularly useful for regulatory purposes. In each framework, the set of all feasible capital allocations leads to a multivariate risk measure. In this paper, we present dual representations for scalar systemic risk measures as well as for the corresponding multivariate risk measures concerning capital allocations. Our cover both frameworks: aggregating after allocating and allocating after aggregation. As examples, we consider the aggregation mechanisms of the Eisenberg Noe model as well as those of the resource allocation and network flow models. 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2020-01-01,11,Mathematics and Financial Economics,convex duality; dual representation; financial network; multivariate risk; penalty function; relative entropy; risk measure; shortfall risk; systemic risk,"Ararat, Ç.

"Lovcha, Y.; Perez-Laborda, A.",Dynamic frequency connectedness between oil and natural gas volatilities,"The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we study dynamic volatility connectedness between oil and natural gas over the period 1994 to 2018. Second, we examine the frequency dynamics of the transmission mechanism arising from frequency-specific responses to volatility shocks. To do so, we adopt a newly introduced approach that decomposes connectedness measures based on variance decompositions into their components at different frequency ranges. Our summarize as follows: (a) there is a substantial variation in volatility spillovers over time (b) the natural gas market was a net transmitter during the central part of our sample period (c) the magnitude of spillovers was smaller after the financial crisis, but volatilities are not decoupled. (d) The volatility propagation mechanism is frequency dependent. Connectedness is typically created at low-frequencies, with volatility shocks across markets having long-lasting effects. However, during some specific periods, such as after Katrina, volatility was transmitted much faster, with shocks dissipating in the short-run. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2020-01-01,52,Economic Modelling,c18; c58; frequency domain; g10; spectral analysis; systemic risk; volatility spillovers,"Lovcha, Y.

The morphology of the carotid artery (CA) changes in response to atherosclerotic development by expansive remodeling (ER), the clinical significance of which remains unclear. This study aimed to define associations between ER and local risk factors, including CA geometry and traditional systemic risk factors for ischemic events, to determine whether ER could serve as a clinical marker of carotid vulnerable plaque. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed 66 patients with CA stenosis who were scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy or CA stenting. They calculated ER ratios in the internal CA (ICA) from long-axis MR images and as the maximal distance between the lumen and the outer borders of the plaque perpendicular to the axis of the ICA the maximal luminal diameter of the distal ICA at a region unaffected by atherosclerosis. Relative overall signal intensity (roSI) was calculated to assess intraplaque hemorrhage and defined as the signal intensity of plaque on an axial T1-weighted image with maximal stenosis relative to that of the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle. The authors evaluated CA geometry by calculating the angles between the common CA (CCA) and ICA, and between the CCA and external CA (ECA) using digital subtraction angiography. The ER ratios, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, roSI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, low-density lipoprotein, statin medication, diabetes, smoking habit, and ischemic heart disease were compared between 33 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic patients. The authors also compared symptomatic status, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, ICA angle, ECA angle, roSI, and other traditional atherosclerotic risk factors between groups with extensive and slight ER. The ER ratio was significantly greater in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (1.91 0.46 vs 1.68 0.40,0.05). The ICA angle was significantly larger in the group with extensive ER than in those with slight ER (33.9 20.2 vs 21.7 13.8p 0.01). The roSI, ECA angle, percentage stenosis, or any other traditional vascular risk factors were not associated with ER. Carotid ER might be an independent indicator of carotid vulnerable plaque, which should be validated in a longitudinal study of patients with carotid atherosclerosis, including those with nonstenotic to moderate stenosis.

"Hanif, H.; Naveed, M.; Rehman, M.U.",Extending the forward systemic risk measure: do sector level variables matter,"Systemic risk is of concern for economic welfare as systemic financial crisis has the potential to inefficiently lower the supply of credit to the nonfinancial sector. Conventional systemic risk measures are parsimonious in nature and are used to assess the current systemic risk contributions of financial institutions and does not highlight future systemic risk. In order to overcome the limitations of conventional systemic risk, (Formula presented.) is used predict future systemic risk and the literature outlines the use of firm and state level variables in the computation. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing empirical evidence on improved computation of forward systemic risk by corroborating the distinctive impact of sector’s nature: munificence, dynamism and level of concentration. The comparison of conventional and proposed forward CoVaR provides interesting insights into the role of sector level variables in the buildup of systemic risk. The highlight that the forecasting ability of forward CoVaR predicted with sector level variables is reasonably higher than that of predicted without sector level variables. The study provides guidelines to the policy makers by providing an improved measure of future systemic risk that can that can help to avoid procycality pitfall by introducing countercyclical policies before the happening of systemic event.

"Scheffer, M.; Weiß, G.N.F.",Extreme dependence in investor attention and stock returns consequences for forecasting stock returns and measuring systemic risk,"We characterize co-movements in investor attention by modeling multivariate internet search volume data. Using a variety of copula models that can capture both asymmetric and skewed dependence, we find empirical evidence of strong non-linear and asymmetric dependence in the attention investors give to companies. Modeling three years of daily stock returns and search volumes from Google Trends for 29 bank names, we find a striking similarity between the dependence structure inherent in stock returns and the dependence in the corresponding time series of search queries. We then document the existence of significant asymmetric and skewed tail dependence in the joint distribution of stock returns and investor attention. Finally, stock returns and internet search volumes appear to evolve concurrently in real time with neither one leading the other. Our findings have important implications, e.g. for the analysis of banks' interconnectedness based on equity data and the pricing of investor attention in the cross-section of stock returns. 2019, 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2020,2020-01-01,0,Quantitative Finance,dependence structures; google trends; investor attention; tail dependence,"Scheffer, M.

"Buthelezi, S.N.",FDI in africa: potential implications of brexit on south africa’s financial sector,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether any potential weakening of the UK’s financial sector, as a result of Brexit, will have a negative impact on South Africa’s financial sector given the close ties between the countries’ financial systems. This paper seeks to also argue that Brexit may provide an opportunity for South Africa to pursue new trade linkages with other countries in Africa and Asia. Design methodology approach: This paper is a review of relevant sources from foreign direct investment (FDI) and international economic literature. It analyses comparative and cross-disciplinary research and examines the current trends in the legal and economic climate in South Africa within the context of economic growth and FDI inflows patterns. Findings: This paper finds that Brexit does not pose a systemic risk to South Africa’s financial system. This paper also finds that South Africa’s recent policy changes may serve as obstacles to South Africa attracting new FDI. Research limitations implications: The implications of Brexit on the investment in the economy of African countries are under-researched, and this paper provides an additional contribution to the euro-centric discussion of the ramifications of Brexit on the economic developments in the financial sector after Britain’s exit. Originality value: This paper argues for an enhanced FDI system for South Africa and its policy proposals can be used to further the independence of African countries from European investment streams. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,2020-01-01,0,Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance,banking reform; brexit; financial sector; foreign investment; south africa; united kingdom,"Buthelezi, S.N.

"Russkova, E.G.; Oleynik, O.S.",Factors of employment institution transformation in russia,"Purpose: The relevance of the study of employment issues in the Russian Federation is connected with the lack of effectiveness of institutions functioning in the labor market. The problems caused by qualitative and quantitative unbalance of labor supply and demand require the in-depth analysis and solution. The state employment service is a significant intermediary between the employee and the employer and provides the functions of development and implementation of comprehensive measures of the economic, social, legal and administrative character of the labor market development. The goal of the research is to identify the factors affecting the transformation of the employment institution in the Russian Federation. Design methodology approach: Currently, a number of problems appeared in the Russian labour market that affect the employment rate and the main of them are: low real disposable incomes, aging population, and difficulty in job finding according to professional training. Based on the use of official statistics, the research materials of domestic and foreign scientists, the article analyzes the employment and identifies the factors that worsen the shortage of personnel in the domestic economy. The authors identify the systemic risks in the labor market associated with the intensification of demographic and migration processes, the expansion of alternative employment, and a decrease in the share of highly qualified jobs in the Russian economy. Findings: The article suggests a system of measures contributing to an effective development of the labor market as a result of the employment institution transformation.

"Barredo-Zuriarrain, J.; Ülgen, F.; Radonjić, O.",Fallacies of market-friendly financial regulation conducted by the federal reserve in the 1990s and 2000s,"This article draws from the Minskyian Post-Keynesian literature on the dynamics of the 21st century capitalism and points to the incompatibility between market-efficiency-based micro-prudential regulatory reforms conducted by the Federal Reserve System in the 1990s 2000s and financial system stability. We argue that these reforms rested on a twofold efficiency fallacy: efficient financial markets regulation-free innovative dynamics and informational transparency seeking market-friendly regulation. Thus, the financial instabilities of the 2000s do not rest on accidental strategies of some irrational individuals but on the liberal regulatory changes implemented in the last decades. This article supplies evidence about the prevalence of this theoretical and policy stance, documenting through speeches and hearings given over the period 1999 2010 by the Fed’s officials. We then show that major regulatory changes conducted by the Fed were based on micro-prudential measures consistent with the blind faith of authorities in the capacity of free financial markets to self-regulate. This faith does not seem to be replaced by an alternative regulatory approach even in the aftermath of the world-wide 2007 2008 catastrophe. The major conclusion of this study is that a relevant alternative regulation should rest on a macro-prudential approach seeking to deal with the endogenously unstable dynamics of capitalism. 2020 Taylor Francis Group, LLC.",2020,2020-01-01,1,Journal of Post Keynesian Economics,federal reserve system; financial crisis; financial regulation; new neoclassical synthesis; self-regulation; systemic risk,"Barredo-Zuriarrain, J.

"Aleknevičienė, V.; Aleksandravičiūtė, I.",Financial behavior of investors: long-run overreaction phenomenon in euronext stock exchange,"The research investigates the long-run overreaction phenomenon in EURONEXT stock exchange. Data of EURONEXT stock exchange for the period of 2000 2017 were employed for the winner and the loser portfolio formation and systemic risk adjustment with the CAPM. Robustness was checked with t-test statistics. The empirical findings revealed long-run reversal effect wherein past long-run loser portfolios outperformed past long-run winner portfolio supporting the overreaction hypothesis with the exception for the period of financial turmoil. This overreaction was close to symmetric: positive average cumulative adjusted returns for the loser portfolio were similar to negative returns for the winner portfolio. Even though the findings supported long-run overreaction in EURONEXT stock exchange, this phenomenon was explained by the differences in risk. Jensen alpha was statistically insignificant, systemic risk of loser portfolio was higher than the one of winner portfolio. These are consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the investors’ rationality there was no possibility to apply the contrarian strategy for earning abnormal returns.

"Melecky, M.; Podpiera, A.M.",Financial sector strategies and financial sector outcomes: do the strategies perform,"Financial sector strategies enable financial policymakers and stakeholders to take a holistic view at the financial development needs in their country and to formulate balanced financial policies. They help policymakers consider the systemic risk that different development policies involve and choose an informed way forward. We construct a new dataset of historical financial sector strategies covering 150 countries over the period 1985 2014, and assess the strategies using the rating criteria proposed by Maimbo and Melecky (2014). We then investigate how the quality of the strategies can affect financial sector outcomes such as financial depth, inclusion, efficiency and stability. We find that the use of financial sector strategies helped increase financial sector deepening, inclusion and stability, and that this impact could be greater for higher quality strategies. One way how financial sector strategies can improve financial sector outcomes is by improving the regulatory framework for finance.

Secondly, by proposing our own methods of proxying we are able to include a significantly bigger number of systemically important financial institutions in the measurement of systemic risk than any other scientific paper quantifying this risk for the analyzed region. Thirdly, we propose an analysis of the two aspects of systemic risk (fragility or contagion) in the periods of the global financial crisis, European debt crisis and recently, during the economic stagnation period.

"Fricke, D.; Roukny, T.",Generalists and specialists in the credit market,"In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the structure of the credit market. Using historical data from Japan, we explore banks’ lending patterns to the real economy. We find that generalist banks (with diversified lending) and specialist banks (with focused lending) coexist, and tend to stick to their strategies over time. Similarly, we also document the coexistence of generalist and specialist industries (based on their borrowing patterns). The observed interaction patterns in the credit market indicate a strong overlap in banks’ loan portfolios, mainly due to specialist banks focusing their investments on the very same generalist industries. A stylized model matches these patterns and allows us to identify economically meaningful sets of generalist banks industries. Lastly, we find that generalist banks are not necessarily less vulnerable to shocks compared to specialists. In fact, high leverage levels can undo the benefits of diversification. 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2020-01-01,8,Journal of Banking and Finance,bank lending; diversification; fire sales; portfolio theory; systemic risk,"Fricke, D.

"Shavshukov, V.M.; Zhuravleva, N.A.",Global economy: new risks and leadership problems,"After the global crisis of 2008 2009, the world economy entered the era of restructuring. This article focuses on the risks that a new leader will face in the process of shaping the world economy. The methods employed in the research include big data processing of continuous change and the of the symmetric macroeconomic analysis based on the statistics collected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), The Word Bank (WB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Central banks and Treasuries. The study proved that the recessionary processes, their depth and global nature, are caused by a combination of world financial system crises and general civilization problems. These new systemic risks for the world economy might result in new global crises that will limit the resources of international financial institutions for sustainable development. Besides, for most banks these crises will mean shifting a big share of derivatives to the off-balance liabilities, using Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in deals, followed by an increase in state and corporate debts, trade wars, a slowdown of economic development in China, and widening contradictions between global and national finances. Regular research and systematization have developed certain guidelines for the global economic restructuring process. First of all, it is recommended on the base of interstate compromises to focus on international agreements to ensure a solid foundation for global finance. On the basis of the comparative analysis carried out for the USA, China and other counties, it was made clear that no one leader in world economy in 21st century views the world reserve as based on the currency of one country only.

"Karkowska, R.",Innovations in risk-transferring mechanisms on financial market and systemic risk,"This chapter brings some of the latest thinking in the growing field of innovation in risk-transferring instruments. It contributes topical insights on the challenges facing the financial industry, such as derivatives exposures across financial institutions that often contribute to systemic risk. Lack of proper knowledge of such exposures often discredits regulatory opportunity to control a financial institution, generating large-scope counterparty bailouts. There are proof points that counterparty risk in derivative exposures is not always well collateralised. However, documenting this evidence is presently impracticable due to the weak quality and lack of standardisation of derivatives exposure by financial companies. The chapter forwards some questions about a maturity transformation and liquidity risk-taking in under-collateralised derivatives. It investigates an academic explanation for a transparency standard for derivatives positions, and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market review. Connecting variety approaches and choosing examples of derivatives innovations, empirical studies and practical views, it presents a contemporary outlook on innovations for systemic risk importance. This chapter consists of five parts and includes the following topics: risk-transferring innovations and bank lending development of the OTC derivatives market structured financial market and systemic risk transparency standard for derivatives and counterparty risk.

"Tsai, I.-C.",Market integration and volatility transmission in england’s housing markets,"In addition to evaluating the long-term and short-term relationships between housing markets on the regional and nationwide scales, this study also explores risk diffusion associated with market integration. Data from January 1995 to July 2017 in nine regions in England and in the overall England housing market are adopted. Through simultaneous estimates of volatility in various regions, the systemic risk and overall risk of each region are evaluated. The reveal that housing markets in the central regions diffuse risks easily, and their volatility is easily affected by stock market return and money supply changes. By contrast, the volatility of housing markets in the southern regions is easily affected by changes in the interest rate, and these markets demonstrate high transmission with the overall housing market in the short term. Notably, except for times when financial crises occurred, housing market risks in the southern regions have been lower than those of other regions. In particular, London exhibits significantly low risk and high return in its housing market and high informativeness in its house prices.

First, we characterize the ""times of fragility"" of such systems (e.g., the times when a macroscopic part of the population defaults or gets infected simultaneously, or when the neuron cells ""synchronize"") explicitly in terms of the dynamics of the driving processes, the current distribution of the particles' values and the topology of the underlying network (represented by its Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue). Second, we use such systems to describe a dynamic credit-network game and show that, in equilibrium, the system regularizes, that is, the times of fragility never occur, as the particles avoid them by adjusting their connections strategically. Two auxiliary mathematicaluseful in their own right, are uncovered during our investigation: a generalization of Schauder's fixed-point theorem for the Skorokhod space with the M1 topology, and the application of max-plus algebra to the equilibrium version of the network flow problem.

"Liu, J.; Song, Q.; Qi, Y.; Rahman, S.; Sriboonchitta, S.",Measurement of systemic risk in global financial markets and its application in forecasting trading decisions,"The global financial crisis in 2008 spurred the need to study systemic risk in financial markets, which is of interest to both academics and practitioners alike. We first aimed to measure and forecast systemic risk in global financial markets and then to construct a trade decision model for investors and financial institutions to assist them in forecasting risk and potential returns based on the of the analysis of systemic risk. The factor copula-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and component expected shortfall (CES) were combined for the first time in this study to measure systemic risk and the contribution of individual countries to global systemic risk in global financial markets. The use of factor copula-based models enabled the estimation of joint models in stages, thereby considerably reducing computational burden. A high-dimensional dataset of daily stock market indices of 43 countries covering the period 2003 to 2019 was used to represent global financial markets. The CES portfolios developed in this study, based on the forecasting of systemic risk, not only allow spreading of systemic risk but may also enable investors and financial institutions to make profits. The main policy implication of our study is that forecasting systemic risk of global financial markets and developing portfolios can provide valuable insights for financial institutions and policy makers to diversify portfolios and spread risk for future investments and trade. 2020 by the authors.",2020,2020-01-01,5,Sustainability (switzerland),dependence; factor copula; financial crisis; forecasting risk; global perspective; market conditions; measurement method; policy making; stock market; stock markets,"Liu, J.

"Widodo, A.",Measuring cyclical behavior of islamic and conventional financing: evidence from indonesian dual banking system,"A thorough analysis about the financial cycle encompassing several financial variables, most importantly including credit, from a conventional perspective has been carried out by previous studies. These studies revealed that the composite cycle is of paramount importance to issue a proper policy. The boom-and-bust of the cycle must be considered in order to achieve the macro prudential of curbing excessive credit growth and preventing the build-up of systemic risk. To that end, in the context of the dual banking system where Islamic and conventional banks operate side by side under similar financial circumstances, it is crucial to assess whether the Islamic financing cycle behaves as its conventional counterpart. Given the fact that most of the literature has focused on the cyclical behavior from a conventional perspective, this paper assesses the characteristics of both Islamic and conventional financing cycles. This analysis will help in framing adequate policy implementation of macro prudential policies for the dual banking system. Following the methodology employed by Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis (2012) in forming the common cycle, this paper concludes that Islamic banks functioning under the same environment as their conventional counterparts, appear to have a similar peak-and-trough cycle but different amplitude. This means that macro prudential policy, particularly countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) policy is deemed crucial to be adopted in Islamic banking as set out in the Islamic Financial Services Board document, IFSB-15 (IFSB, 2013). 2020.

The most common sites involved in mucormycosis infection are the sinus, lung, skin and soft tissues, gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, and rarely the mandible. Systemic risk factors for mucormycosis are diabetes mellitus (DM), neutropenia, corticosteroid use, hematologic malignancies, organ transplantation, metabolic acidosis, deferoxamine use, and advanced age. Local risk factors are a history of trauma, burns, surgery. We report on two patients with mucormycosis of the jaw.

"Ozili, P.K.",Non-performing loans in european systemic and non-systemic banks,"Purpose: The distinction between systemic banks (GSIBs) and non-systemic banks (non-GSIBs) is driven by policy reasons. This study aims to examine the behaviour of non-performing loans in European GSIBs and non-GSIBs from 2004 to 2013. Design methodology approach: The author uses regression methodology to analyse the association between non-performing loans (NPLs) and the state of the economy. Findings: The author finds that more profitable banks witness higher NPLs regardless of them being systemic or non-systemic. Secondly, GSIBs have fewer NPLs during economic booms and during periods of increased lending, while non-GSIBs experience higher NPLs during periods of increased lending. The author also observes that European non-GSIBs that exceed regulatory capital requirement also experience higher NPLs. In the post-crisis period, there is a significant and negative relationship between NPLs and the economic cycle for GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period and a significant and positive relationship between NPLs, loan supply and bank profitability for GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period on the other hand, there is a significant and negative relationship between NPLs and regulatory capital ratios for non-GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period and a significant and positive relationship between NPLs and bank profitability for non-GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period. The findings have implications. Originality value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, the literature on the determinants of NPL has not empirically examined the behaviour of NPLs in European GSIBs and non-GSIBs. This paper examines this issue to provide insights to help policymakers and academics understand the peculiarities of NPLs in Europe. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,2020-01-01,8,Journal of Financial Economic Policy,asset quality; bank profitability; banks; credit risk; europe; european banks; financial risk and risk management; impaired loans; macroeconomic policy; non-performing loans; systemic banks; systemic risk,"Ozili, P.K.

PVT is caused by a combination of local and systemic risk factors. PVT in cirrhosis is accompanied by an increased risk of both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. PVT can be classified according to the time of development, localization, pathophysiology and complications. Ultrasound, CT and MRI play an important role in the evaluation of this condition. The range of treatment for PVT includes close monitoring without intervention, anticoagulation, thrombolysis, thrombectomy, angioplasty, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. According to the EASL clinical guidelines for vascular diseases of the liver, the use of direct-acting anticoagulants is recommended.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Physiotherapy laboratory, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (Brazil). Participants: A total of 101 football players (52 professional and 49 under-20 players). Intervention: An evidence-based testing protocol for screening HSI risk factors. Main Outcome Measures: Anamnesis, ultrasonography of the hamstrings, passive straight-leg raise test, Functional Movement Screen, and isokinetic dynamometry were performed. Eleven HSI risk factors for each leg were assessed, besides the player’s age as a systemic risk factor. Reports were delivered to the coaching staff.Professionals had greater prevalence of HSI history compared with under-20 players (40% vs 18%). No between-group differences were found for the other screening tests. Altogether, 30% of players had already sustained at least one HSI 58% had a history of injuries in adjacent regions 49% had short biceps femoris fascicles 66% and 21% had poor passive and active flexibility, respectively 42% and 29% had deficits in functional movements and core stability, respectively 7% and 26% presented bilateral imbalance for hamstring concentric and eccentric strength, respectively 87% and 94% obtained low values for hamstring-to-quadriceps conventional and functional ratios, respectively. Two-thirds of players hadtorisk factors per leg. None of the players was fully free of HSI risk factors. Conclusion: Most football players present multiple risk factors for sustaining an HSI. Hamstring weakness is the most prevalent risk factor, but the teams should also be aware of deficits in flexibility, core stability, functional movements, and hamstring fascicle length. 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.",2020,2020-01-01,27,Journal of Sport Rehabilitation,adolescent; adult; athletic injuries; cross-sectional studies; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; echography; exercise test; hamstring muscle; hamstring muscles; human; humans; injury; injury prevention; male; mass screening; muscle injury; muscle strength; pathophysiology; physiology; prevalence; procedures; risk factor; risk factors; soccer; sport; sport injury; sprains and strains; ultrasonography; young adult,"Ribeiro-Alvares, J.B.

"Chen, C.Y.-H.; Nasekin, S.",Quantifying systemic risk with factor copulas,"We propose a tail dependence based network approach to study systemic risk in a network of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). We utilize a flexible factor copula based method which allows to measure the level of extreme risk in a portfolio when dependence is driven by one or several factors. We identify the most connected’ SIFIs based on an eigenvector centrality approach applied to copula-implied dependence structures as central’ SIFIs. We then demonstrate that the level of systemic risk implied by such SIFIs chosen as conditioning factors in the factor copula setup exceeds that which is implied by non-central SIFIs in terms of portfolio Value-at-Risk and the portfolio return under stress. This study contributes to quantification and ranking of the systemic importance of SIFIs which is important for setting adequate capital requirements in particular and stability of financial markets in general. 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2020,2020-01-01,3,European Journal of Finance,eigenvector centrality; factor copula; network; tail dependence; value-at-risk,"Chen, C.Y.-H.

"Boersma, M.; Maliutin, A.; Sourabh, S.; Hoogduin, L.A.; Kandhai, D.",Reducing the complexity of financial networks using network embeddings,"Accounting scandals like Enron (2001) and Petrobas (2014) remind us that untrustworthy financial information has an adverse effect on the stability of the economy and can ultimately be a source of systemic risk. This financial information is derived from processes and their related monetary flows within a business. But as the flows are becoming larger and more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to distill the primary processes for large amounts of transaction data. However, by extracting the primary processes we will be able to detect possible inconsistencies in the information efficiently. We use recent advances in network embedding techniques that have demonstrated promising regarding node classification problems in domains like biology and sociology. We learned a useful continuous vector representation of the nodes in the network which can be used for the clustering task, such that the clusters represent the meaningful primary processes. The show that we can extract the relevant primary processes which are similar to the created clusters by a financial expert. Moreover, we construct better predictive models using the flows from the extracted primary processes which can be used to detect inconsistencies. Our work will pave the way towards a more modern technology and data-driven financial audit discipline. 2020, The Author(s).",2020,2020-01-01,1,Scientific Reports,accounting; article; embedding; sociology,"Boersma, M.

"Gong, X.-L.; Liu, X.-H.; Xiong, X.; Zhang, W.",Research on china's financial systemic risk contagion under jump and heavy-tailed risk,"To accurately measure the dynamic characteristics of systemic risk contagion under the impact of extreme financial events, we construct a research framework that analyzes the contagion dynamics of systemic risk under extreme risk impact from the perspectives of both time and space. Based on the macro-jump CCA method, this paper extracts the heterogeneous volatility sequence of financial industries considering the thick tail of the distribution of financial assets returns. Then, the dynamic variation of systemic risk in the financial sectors is characterized from the time dimension. The volatility spillover network method is used to examine the spillover contagion of systemic risk among financial system sectors from the spatial dimension. Empirical studies have found that when considering the risk contagion level, the capital market service sector plays a risk leading role, followed by the currency service sector and the insurance sector. The measurement indicators that consider the jump risk and the tail risk have good early warning effects on extreme financial events. Seen from the spatial direction of risk spillover, the real estate sector exhibits the most obvious risk spillover effect on other sectors and can be regarded as the source of systemic risk, which suggests differentiated regulation. 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2020-01-01,17,International Review of Financial Analysis,jump risk; systemic risk; tail risk; volatility spillover network,"Gong, X.-L.

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of an intracameral combination ofmydriatics andanesthetic (ICMA, Mydrane) for cataract surgery in patients with well-controlled type-2 diabetes. Methods: Post-hoc subgroup analysis of a phaserandomized study, comparing ICMA to a conventional topical regimen. Data were collected from 68 centers in Europe and Algeria. Only well-controlled type-2 diabetics, free of pre-proliferative retinopathy, were included. The for non-diabetics are also reported. The primary efficacy variable was successful capsulorhexis without additional mydriatic treatment. Postoperative safety included adverse events, endothelial cell density and vision.Among 591 randomized patients, 57 (9.6%) had controlled typediabetes 24 (42.1%) in the ICMA Group and 33 (57.9%) in the Topical Group intention-to-treat (ITT) setAmong diabetics, capsulorhexis was successfully performed without additional mydriatics in 24 (96.0% modified-ITT set) patients in the ICMA Group and 26 (89.7%) in the Topical Group. These proportions were similar in non-diabetics. No diabetic patient (0.5%) non-diabetics in the ICMA Group had a significant decrease in pupil size3 mm) intraoperatively compared to(16.0% modified-ITT set) diabetics 16 (7.3%) non-diabetics in the Topical group. Ocular AE among diabetics occurred in(8.0% Safety set) patients in the ICMA Group and(16.7%) in the Topical Group. Endothelial cell density atmonth postoperatively was similar between groups in diabetics (P 0.627) and non-diabetics (P 0.368).ICMA is effective and can be safely used in patients with well-controlled diabetes, with potential advantages compared to a topical regimen including reduced systemic risk, better corneal integrity and reduced risk of ocular complications.

To achieve thiswe use GARCH-BEKK model to construct the volatility network of G20 stock markets, and calculate the Bonacich centrality to capture the most active and influential nodes. Finally, we innovatively use the volatility network matrix as spatial weight matrix and establish spatial Durbin model to measure the direct and spatial spillover effects. We highlight several key observations: there are significant spatial spillover effects in global stock markets volatility spillover network exists aggregation effects, hierarchical structure and dynamic evolution features the risk contagion capability of traditional financial power countries falls, while that of financial small countries rises stock market volatility, government debt and inflation are positively correlated with systemic risk, while current account and macroeconomic performance are negatively correlated the indirect spillover effects of all explanatory variables on systemic risk are greater than the direct spillover effects. 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2020-01-01,28,North American Journal of Economics and Finance,garch-bekk model; risk contagion; spatial durbin model; spatial spillover; volatility network,"Zhang, W.

"Saunders, A.; Schmid, M.; Walter, I.",Strategic scope and bank performance,"One of the most dramatic trends in banking since the 1980s has been the secular movement away from core banking and interest generating activities towards enhanced reliance on non-interest-generating activities that focus largely on fees and trading profits. In this paper, we draw on a dataset covering nearly a million quarterly observations on more than 12,000 US banks and find no evidence that this shift in the bank business model harms bank profitability. To the contrary, a higher share of non-traditional bank income is associated with a higher profitability. The increase in profitability does not seem to come at the cost of substantially larger bank-level risk taking, at least not for large banks, which are the banks mostly involved in non-traditional bank business. There is also no conclusive evidence that a larger share of non-traditional income is associated with a larger contribution to systemic risk. The net benefits of non-traditional income increased in the 2000s, when both interest rates and bank margins started to decline. Estimation techniques that mitigate endogeneity concerns resulting from unobserved heterogeneity also show larger net benefits associated with greater bank reliance on generating non-traditional income. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2020-01-01,13,Journal of Financial Stability,bank size; core-banking activity; financial crises; non-traditional income; systemic risk,"Saunders, A.

"Fatone, L.; Mariani, F.",Systemic risk governance in a dynamical model of a banking system with stochastic assets and liabilities,"We consider the problem of governing systemic risk in an assets liabilities dynamical model of a banking system. In the model considered, each bank is represented by its assets and liabilities. The net worth of a bank is the difference between its assets and liabilities and bank is solvent when its net worth is greater than or equal to zero otherwise, the bank has failed. The banking system dynamics is defined by an initial value problem for a system of stochastic differential equations whose independent variable is time and whose dependent variables are the assets and liabilities of the banks. The banking system model presented generalizes those discussed in Fouque and Sun (in: Fouque, Langsam (eds) Handbook of systemic risk, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 444 452, 2013) and Fatone and Mariani (J Glob Optim 75(3):851 883, 2019) and describes a homogeneous population of banks. The main features of the model are a cooperation mechanism among banks and the possibility of the (direct) intervention of the monetary authority in the banking system dynamics. By systemic risk or systemic event in a bounded time interval, we mean that in that time interval at least a given fraction of banks have failed. The probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is evaluated via statistical simulation. Systemic risk governance aims to maintain the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval between two given thresholds. The monetary authority is responsible for systemic risk governance. The governance consists in the choice of assets and liabilities of a kind of ideal bank as functions of time and in the choice of the rules for the cooperation mechanism among banks. These rules are obtained by solving an optimal control problem for the pseudo mean field approximation of the banking system model. Governance induces banks in the system to behave like the ideal bankShocks acting on the banks’ assets or liabilities are simulated. Numerical examples of systemic risk governance in the presence and absence of shocks acting on the banking system are studied. 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2020-01-01,2,Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination,,"Fatone, L.

"Tiwari, A.K.; Trabelsi, N.; Alqahtani, F.; Raheem, I.D.",Systemic risk spillovers between crude oil and stock index returns of g7 economies: conditional value-at-risk and marginal expected shortfall approaches,"In this study, we examine systemic risk and dependence between oil and stock market indices of G7 economies between January 2003 and November 2017. Coincidentally, this timeframe covers different distress periods in financial and energy markets. We use several time-constant, time-varying and time-varying Markov-copula models to examine the dependence. Further, we use the delta conditional value-at-risk (ΔCoVaR) of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) of Acharya et al. (2012) to captures the risk spillover effects and give evidence of systemic risk. From the copula analysis, we find dissimilar dependence structure between returns series of oil and the G7 stock markets. For France, Germany and Japan, the dependence is Markov-switching time-varying, while it is time-varying for the United States and Canada, constant for the United Kingdom and around zero for Italy. Our empirical evidence on systemic risk indicates that oil price dynamics contributes significantly more to the G7 stock market returns during volatile times than during tranquil times. In particular, the Canada stock market appears more sensitive and vulnerable to negative external shocks emerging from the crude oil market than the other markets. Further, the country risk rankings identified using MES and ΔCoVaR may not be identical. In addition, the analysis suggest that the crude oil market can be a good diversifier for investors in Japan and France and that the investors in the rest of G7 countries must act more carefully. 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2020-01-01,48,Energy Economics,canada; commerce; conditional value-at-risk; covar; crude oil; dependence structures; energy market; expected shortfall; financial market; financial markets; france; g-7 country; g7; germany; investments; japan; mes; oil prices; petroleum analysis; price dynamics; risk spillover effect; spillover effect; stock market; stock market index; stock markets; systemic risk; systemic risks; united kingdom; united states; value engineering,"Tiwari, A.K.

"Mayer, N.; Sottet, J.-S.",Systemic security risks in the telecommunications sector: an approach for security and integrity of networks and services,"A strong emphasis is placed today on the security of Information Systems (IS) and on the management of information security risks. This tendency can be seen in numerous emerging regulations imposing a riskbased approach for IS security on entire economic sectors. However, a major drawback of the methods currently used is that risks are assessed individually by each organization for its own activities, and that no link is established between the risk management of interacting organizations. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with systemic risks, i.e. risks propagated from one organization to another due to dependencies between them. This approach is an extension of an existing framework used from 2015 by a European national regulator in the telecommunications sector. 2020 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

"Wilmarth, A.E.; Jr., N.A.",Taming the megabanks: why we need a new glass-steagall act,"This book demonstrates that universal banks which accept deposits, make loans, and engage in securities activities played central roles in precipitating the Great Depression of the early 1930s and the Great Recession of 2007 09. Universal banks promoted a dangerous credit boom and a hazardous stock market bubble in the U.S. during the 1920s, which led to the Great Depression. Congress responded by passing the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which separated banks from the securities markets and prohibited nonbanks from accepting deposits. Glass-Steagall’s structural separation of the banking, securities, and insurance sectors prevented financial panics from spreading across the U.S. financial system for more than four decades. Despite Glass-Steagall’s success, large U.S. banks pursued a twenty-year campaign to remove the statute’s prudential buffers. Regulators opened loopholes in Glass-Steagall during the 1980s and 1990s, and Congress repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999. The United Kingdom and the European Union adopted similar deregulatory measures, thereby allowing universal banks to dominate financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition, large U.S. securities firms became shadow banks as regulators allowed them to issue short-term deposit substitutes to finance long-term loans and investments. Universal banks and shadow banks fueled a toxic subprime credit boom in the U.S., U.K., and Europe during the 2000s, which led to the Great Recession. Limited reforms after the Great Recession have not broken up universal banks and shadow banks, thereby leaving in place a financial system that is prone to excessive risk-taking and vulnerable to contagious panics. A new Glass-Steagall Act is urgently needed to restore a financial system that is less risky, more stable and resilient, and better able to serve the needs of our economy and society.

"Cayón, E.; Sarmiento, J.",Testing for contagion from oil and developed markets to emerging markets: an empirical analysis using systemic risk parameter,"This paper analyses the volatility transmission from changes in prices in oil and developed stock markets to emerging markets. We test for volatility contagion from these two factors while allowing for interaction between them in order to account for diversification effects using the M-GARCH framework in a traditional two-factor market model. We find evidence that for all the periods under observation the covariance between developed markets and oil prices is negative. This negative covariance leads to a diversification effect, which lowers the impact of developed market prices on the systemic risk of emerging markets and gives support for the decoupling hypothesis concerning emerging market volatility during the beginning of the global financial crisis (GFC).

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the potentials and limitations of these measures by evaluating both the immediate and the overall impact of macroprudential policies on banks' lending to the non-financial private sector in Croatia. The findings reveal the divergent impact of macroprudential measures on banks' lending with regards to their direction, i.e. tightening or loosening. Policy makers should bear this in mind when opting for a tightening of their policy stance as the reversal of that action may not match the initial impact of itsAdditionally, from a policymaker perspective, this paper provides potential evidence of cross-border policy spillovers, which should be taken into account in order to conduct an effective macroprudential policy.

"del, R.R.M.; Korniyenko, Y.; Patnam, M.; Porter, M.A.",The multiplex nature of global financial contagions,"As illustrated by the 2008 global financial crisis, the financial distress of one country can trigger financial distress in other countries. We examine the problem of identifying such systemically important countries (i.e., countries whose financial distress can trigger further distress), which is important for assessing global financial stability. Using data on bilateral financial positions that are split by asset type, we build a multiplex global financial network in which nodes represent countries, edges encode cross-country financial assets of various types, and layers represent asset types. We examine the temporal evolution of a measure of node importance known as MultiRank centrality, and we find that several major European countries decrease in rank and that several major Asian countries increase in rank since 2008. We then develop a multiplex threshold model of financial contagions in which a shock can propagate either within a layer or between layers. We find that the number of systemically important countries can be twice as large when we take into account the heterogeneity of financial exposures (i.e., when using a multiplex network) than in a contagion on an associated aggregate global financial network (i.e., on a monolayer network), as is often examined in other studies. We also study the extent to which buffers can reduce the propagation of financial distress. Our analysis suggests that accounting for both intralayer and interlayer propagation of contagions in a multiplex structure of financial assets is important for understanding interconnected financial systems of countries. 2020, The Author(s).",2020,2020-01-01,0,Applied Network Science,financial contagions; multiplex networks; systemic risk,"del Rio-Chanona, R.M.

Using credit rating data from Standard Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch for the period ranging from 2002 to 2016, we identify both positive and negative bank-to-sovereign spillover effects, and find the negative rating spillover effect to be more pronounced than the positive one.

Our are robust to the changes in model specifications with respect to the currency type of ratings, the structure of regression models, and the approach used to link bank and sovereign ratings.

"Gallegati, M.; Palestrini, A.; Russo, A.",The school of agent-based models in ancona,"This chapter follows the path taken by our research group to extend economic modeling to the analysis of complex systems. It began with research meetings in the old Economic Department of the Faculty of Economics in the 1990s, where we imagined possible ways of introducing heterogeneity in traditional economic analysis arriving to the present day with the latest research which analyses interaction networks between economic agents (e.g., bank-firm), underlining the importance of composition effects and the emergence of macro-level properties that cannot be limited to the behavior of a representative agentIn fact, from the very beginning this research group has believed in the importance of analyzing the distribution of the characteristics of economic individuals (income, wealth, etc.) and of their direct interactions mediated by a network. Recent developments, using the agent-based methodology (i.e. an approach with interacting heterogeneous agents that simulates, through the use of computers, the evolution of complex economic systems), focus on the role of financial fragility, inequality, systemic risk and the crises of the capitalist system, extending the framework to an increasingly broader macroeconomic model. One of the main concerns the role of interaction between financial factors and the real economy, through the analysis of the effects of network between the different micro-entities of the system and the potential contagion effect through the financial economics channels, also highlighting the positive role of regulation. The research group has also shown the relevance of the combination of financial fragility and inequality, two interrelated phenomena that have characterized the economic development of Western countries in recent decades and are at the root of understanding the Great Recession. Another line of research concerned the application of mathematical-statistical tools, used in particular in physics, for the analysis of economic and financial phenomena, contributing to the development of Econophysics. This research group aims to continue, over the next few years, to provide new ideas and tools to study the macroeconomic dynamics of heterogeneous agents that must coordinate in a complex system.

"Garschagen, M.; Wood, S.L.R.; Garard, J.; Ivanova, M.; Luers, A.",Too big to ignore: global risk perception gaps between scientists and business leaders,"Two major reports assessing global systemic risks have been published recently, presenting large-scale panel data on the risk perceptions of different key communities, most notably business leaders and global change scientists. While both of these global communities agree on ranking environmental risks the highest, followed by societal, geopolitical, technological, and economic risks, business leaders perceive the likelihood of most risks as lower than scientists. This gap implies vexing questions in relation to building a shared sense of urgency and facilitating collective action. These questions need to be addressed through new ways of co-creating risk assessments and strategic futures analysis. 2020 The Authors.",2020,2020-01-01,4,Earth's Future,collective action; global risks; shared sense of risk,"Garschagen, M.

"Naseri, M.; Bacha, O.I.; Masih, M.",Too small to succeed versus too big to fail: how much does size matter in banking,"Even though large banks could imply large risks and heightened vulnerability for a country’s macroeconomy, the presence of many small banks with similar behavior such as Islamic banks could also cause systemic risks. This article makes an initial attempt to investigate the impact of bank size on banking performance. Our study spans 12 emerging countries with dual banking systems and applies two-step dynamic system GMM estimator. The show that size really does matter in the banking industry, and its impact on performance tends to be non-linear with a trade-off between profitability and efficiency. Comparing conventional with Islamic banks, we find that bank size has almost the same impact on the performance of both types of banks.

"Distefano, T.; Tuninetti, M.; Laio, F.; Ridolfi, L.",Tools for reconstructing the bilateral trade network: a critical assessment,"This study critically assesses the performances of the Gravity Model (GM) and of the RAS algorithm for the bilateral flow intensity estimations and link prediction. The main novelty is the application of these methodologies to reconstruct the network topology with a minimum amount of information. Moreover, we implement a multi-layer analysis to provide a comprehensive and robust framework, by testing several food commodities, over the period 1986 2013. The main outcomes suggest that the RAS algorithm outperforms the Gravity Model in the estimations of the bilateral trade flows, importantly guaranteeing the balance constraints (i.e. global import equals global export), while GM generates lower relative errors, but it underestimates total global flows. Both RAS and GM can be applied to accurately recover the network architecture.

"Barthe-Delanoë, A.-M.; Mu, W.",Towards a context-aware systemic risk management framework for the crisis response,"Crisis response is, as any other collaborative networked organization, challenged by changes and vulnerabilities. Moreover, as a complex system with distributed activities and numerous interdependencies, considering the risk of such an organization at a systemic level, including time and space dimensions, is necessary. Systemic risk management is a topic traditionally studied in the finance area. Even if a few researches now focus on the supply chain management area (a more relatable domain regarding crisis response), there is even fewer literature regarding systemic risk management for the crisis response. Thus, this paper proposes first to define systemic risk related to the case of the crisis response. Then, a framework for context-aware systemic risk management is presented, to support the design as well as the follow-up of the crisis response, meeting one of the challenges of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. 2020 Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, ISCRAM.

"Hoffmann, U.; Clemens, V.; König, E.; Brähler, E.; Fegert, J.M.",Violence against children and adolescents by nursing staff: prevalence rates and implications for practice,"International studies show that child maltreatment is a widespread but often underestimated problem that causes high individual, social and economic costs. Child maltreatment is an important topic for the medical sector as well. On the one hand, affected persons often seek support and help from healthcare professionals, but on the other hand, assaults can also occur in medical institutions by healthcare professionals. Surprisingly, there is hardly any data on the frequency of child maltreatment by healthcare professionals in general and particularly by nursing staff. Methods: Therefore, in a large representative survey of the German population of 2,516 subjects aged between 14 and 91, the experience of child maltreatment in medical institutions by nursing staff was assessed retrospectively.Of the 46 subjects who had an inpatient stay in a child and adolescent psychiatry before the age of 18, 33.3% reported to have experienced maltreatment by nursing staff, while 17.3% of the 474 persons who had an inpatient stay in general or pediatric hospitals experienced maltreatment by nursing staff. All forms of maltreatment were significantly more frequent in psychiatric compared to general and pediatric hospitals.The of our representative retrospective survey demonstrate that maltreatment by nursing staff are not rare individual cases, but that medical facilities bear systemic risks for assault. Therefore, it is necessary that all medical institutions, in particular psychiatric hospitals, address this issue. In order to reduce the risk for assaults, it is important not only to implement structural measures but also to develop an attitude that emphasizes zero tolerance for violence against children and adolescents. 2020, The Author(s).",2020,2020-01-01,4,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,adolescent; adult; aged; article; assault; attitude; child; child abuse; child and adolescent psychiatry; child maltreatment; child protection; child psychiatry; female; german (citizen); hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; medical institutions; mental hospital; nursing; nursing staff; pediatric hospital; prevalence; retrospective study; young adult,"Hoffmann, U.

"Sun, K.; Luxhøj, J.T.",A hybrid approach for modelling dynamic flows and systemic risks in supply chains,The uncertainty of supply chain operations is becoming more complex with the growth of globalised business collaborations. Temporal business environment fluctuations cause disruptions that require quantitative risk analysis tools to understand and mitigate supply chain risks. This paper presents the formulation and application of the dynamic flow Bayesian networks (DFBNs) and the optimised dynamic flow Bayesian networks (ODFBNs) for a three-stage supply chain. DFBNs are created by integrating dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) and system dynamics (SD) to demonstrate the feedback flows of a supply chain with systemic risks considered. ODFBNs that incorporate mathematical optimisation with the original DFBNs are also developed to generate an optimisation-enhanced risk-influenced dynamic flow analysis. DFBN and ODFBN provide supply chain practitioners with a more effective reference for their business strategy.

"Chen, J.; Zhu, Q.",A linear quadratic differential game approach to dynamic contract design for systemic cyber risk management under asymmetric information,"In this paper, we consider a delegated dynamic systemic cyber risk management problem between a resource owner (principal) and a risk manager (agent). The principal can only observe cyber risk outcomes of the network rather than the efforts that the agent spends on protecting the resources. Under this asymmetric information, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational behaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic contract design which can be seen as a special class of differential game. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent's hidden efforts. We characterize the optimal mechanism design by reformulating the problem into a stochastic optimal control program and derive the solution explicitly. We further reveal a separation principle for dynamic risk management where the effort estimation and the compensation design can be achieved separately. 2018 IEEE.",2019,2019-01-01,9,"2018 56th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, Allerton 2018",asymmetric information; compensation designs; dynamics; game theory; incentive compatible; information management; linear quadratic differential games; machine design; management problems; managers; optimal mechanism designs; risk management; risk perception; separation principle; stochastic control systems; stochastic optimal control; stochastic systems,"Chen, J.

"He, Z.; Krishnamurthy, A.",A macroeconomic framework for quantifying systemic risk,"Systemic risk arises when shocks lead to states where a disruption in financial intermediation adversely affects the economy and feeds back into further disrupting financial intermediation. We present a macroeconomic model with a financial intermediary sector subject to an equity capital constraint. The novel aspect of our analysis is that the model produces a stochastic steady state distribution for the economy, in which only some of the states correspond to systemic risk states. The model allows us to examine the transition from ""normal"" states to systemic risk states. We calibrate our model and use it to match the systemic risk apparent during the 2007 2008 financial crisis. We also use the model to compute the conditional probabilities of arriving at a systemic risk state, such as 2007 2008. Finally, we show how the model can be used to conduct a macroeconomic ""stress test"" linking a stress scenario to the probability of systemic risk states. 2019 American Economic Association.",2019,2019-01-01,41,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,,"He, Z.

"Apergis, E.; Apergis, I.; Apergis, N.",A new macro stress testing approach for financial realignment in the eurozone,"Contrary to the common approach of stress-testing under which banks are evaluated whether they are distressed, this empirical study chooses to move from the micro stress test approach to a wider new macro stress test category. By being able to stress testing the entire economy of the Eurozone, it will permit big banks to fail and, at the same time, will open room for new banking players to enter the sector, promoting the essence of a healthy destruction. The analysis performs a battery of stress tests, by implementing VaR, Cornish-Fisher VaR, Monte Carlo VaR, Expected Shortfall, Cornish-Fisher Expected Shortfall, and Monte Carlo Expected Shortfall. At the same time, it explicitly considers the new regulatory approach of IFRS9 to incorporate extreme values from forecasted series in the distributions. The analysis also performs two versions of stress tests, one including TARGET2 and one without it. The document that future stress tests should include TARGET2 values in order to capture a better picture of the stressed economy. The findings from these stress tests clearly illustrate that although there has been a trough after the distress call of 2008, this trough ended. These are derived without including the TARGET2 transfers. By including the TARGET2 transfers we receive a different picture that possibly acts as a protective mechanism against any future crisis. Caution is still advised, possibly due to some lingering imbalances within the Eurozone. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2019-01-01,4,"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money",european banking union; financial stability; macro stress test; macroprudential policy; systemic risk,"Apergis, E.

"Hambly, B.; Søjmark, A.",An SPDE model for systemic risk with endogenous contagion,"We propose a dynamic mean-field model for systemic risk’ in large financial systems, derived from a system of interacting diffusions on the positive half-line with an absorbing boundary at the origin. These diffusions represent the distances-to-default of financial institutions, and absorption at zero corresponds to default. As a way of modelling correlated exposures and herd behaviour, we consider a common source of noise and a form of mean-reversion in the drift. Moreover, we introduce an endogenous contagion mechanism whereby the default of one institution causes a drop in the distances-to-default of the other institutions. In this way, we aim to capture key system-wide’ effects on risk. The resulting mean-field limit is characterised uniquely by a nonlinear SPDE on the half-line with a Dirichlet boundary condition. The density of this SPDE gives the conditional law of a non-standard conditional’ McKean Vlasov diffusion, for which we provide a novel upper Dirichlet heat kernel type estimate. Depending on the realisations of the common noise and the rate of mean-reversion, the SPDE can exhibit rapid accelerations in the loss of mass at the boundary. In other words, the contagion mechanism can give rise to periods of significant systemic default clustering. 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019,2019-01-01,15,Finance and Stochastics,common noise; conditional mckean–vlasov problem; contagion; mean-field type spde on half-line; particle system; systemic risk,"Hambly, B.

A typical feature of erysipelas, especially on the lower limbs, is the tendency to reoccur and the study aimed to define the comorbidities associated with it. AIM: We aimed to investigate systemic and local comorbidities in patients diagnosed with erysipelas on the lower limbs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospectively-prospective, population-based cohort study which included all patients diagnosed with erysipelas on the lower limbs, during two years. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with first episode and patients with recurrent erysipelas. These two groups were compared, with particular emphasis on systemic and local comorbidities.The study included 313 patients, of which 187 with the first episode of erysipelas and 126 with a recurrent. Regarding the analyzed systemic risk factors, the recurrent erysipelas was significantlassociated with obesity (p 0.0001), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (p 0.0015), history of malignant disease (p 0.02) and tonsillectomy (p 0.000001). For a p-value 0.0001, significantly more frequent finding of peripheral arterial occlusive disease, chronic oedema lymphoedema, fungal infections of the affected leg and chronic ulcer was confirmed in recurrent erysipelas.

"Ayadi, M.A.; Ayadi, N.; Trabelsi, S.","Corporate governance, european bank performance and the financial crisis","Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the effects of internal and external governance mechanisms on the performance and risk taking of banks from the Euro zone before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Design methodology approach: To avoid macroeconomic problems and shocks and because of data availability, the authors select some countries of the Euro zone, namely, France, Belgium, Germany and Finland, during the 2004-2009 period. These countries share similar macroeconomic environments (unemployment, inflation and economic growth rates). All the data relating to the banks are manually drawn from the supervising reports submitted to banks and are available on the banks’ websites and or on that of the AMF website. The banks included in our sample are drawn from the list of European central banks on www.ecb.int Findings: The empirical show that banks undertake tradeoffs between different governance mechanisms to alleviate the intensity of the agency conflicts between the shareholders and managers. The findings also confirm that internal mechanisms and capital regulations are complementary and significantly impact bank performance. Research limitations implications: This analysis can be extended through studying the interaction between bondholders’ governance and shareholders’ governance and their impact on the 2008 financial crisis. Practical implications: The changes in banking governance help banks find a useful and necessary way to avoid ill-considered risks that can cause a systemic risk. Therefore, some conditions should be met so that banking governance can contribute to the economic development. Social implications: Culture and mentality of good banking governance must grow as much as possible through awareness-raising, training, promotion, recognition of performance, enhancing procedure transparency and stability of good banking governance and regulations, strengthening the national capacity to fight against corruption, and preventive mechanisms. Originality value: This paper complements previous studies, mainly those of Andres and Vallelado (2008) who examine the impact of the components of the board on banking performance and of Laeven and Levine (2009) who estimate the combined effect of regulatory and ownership structure on the risk-taking of each bank. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2019,2019-01-01,8,Managerial Auditing Journal,capital regulation; financial crisis; financial performance; insolvency risk; internal mechanisms,"Ayadi, M.A. (Goodman School of Business, Brock University, Saint Catharines, Canada); Ayadi, N.

"Dolfin, M.; Knopoff, D.; Limosani, M.; Xibilia, M.G.",Credit risk contagion and systemic risk on networks,"This paper proposes a model of the dynamics of credit contagion through non-performing loans on financial networks. Credit risk contagion is modeled in the context of the classical SIS (Susceptibles-Infected-Susceptibles) epidemic processes on networks but with a fundamental novelty. In fact, we assume the presence of two different classes of infected agents, and then we differentiate the dynamics of assets subject to idiosyncratic risk from those affected by systemic risk by adopting a SIIS (Susceptible-Infected1-Infected2-Susceptible) model. In the recent literature in this field, the effect of systemic credit risk on the performance of the financial network is a hot topic. We perform numerical simulations intended to explore the roles played by two different network structures on the long-term behavior of assets affected by systemic risk in order to analyze the effect of the topology of the underlying network structure on the spreading of systemic risk on the structure. Random graphs, i.e., the Erd s-R nyi model, are considered ""benchmark"" network structures while core-periphery structures are often indicated in the literature as idealized structures, although they are able to capture interesting, specific features of real-world financial networks. Moreover, as a matter of comparison, we also perform numerical experiments on small-world networks. 2019 by the authors.",2019,2019-01-01,11,Mathematics,complex systems; core-periphery networks; credit risk; epidemicmodeling; randomnetworks,"Dolfin, M.

"Nguyen, D.D.; Nguyen, L.; Sila, V.",Does corporate culture affect bank risk-taking evidence from loan-level data,"Using comprehensive corporate and retail loan data, we show that the corporate culture of banks explains their risk-taking behaviour. Banks whose corporate culture leans towards aggressive competition are associated with riskier lending practices: higher approval rate, lower borrower quality, and fewer covenant requirements. Consequently, these banks incur larger loan losses and make greater contributions to systemic risk. The opposite behaviour is observed among banks whose culture emphasizes control and safety. Our findings cannot be explained by heterogeneity in a bank's business model, CEO compensation incentives or CEO characteristics.

From the perspective of time dimension and space dimension, the causal complex network among financial institutions is analyzed with the dynamic variation of systemic risk measured. One improvement is that the CAPM is employed to filter out the market risk. Moreover, we study the contribution of individual financial firm to the systemic risk through three well known systemic risk measures containing the systemic risk index (SRISK), the marginal expected shortfall (MES) and the conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR). The proposed methodology framework is applied to the banks, securities and insurance companies in Chinese financial markets. Empirical researches find that the causal network of Chinese financial entities possesses small world and scale free properties, with the number of connections increasing dramatically in turmoil periods, indicating stronger interconnectedness in the financial system during crisis. Moreover, the network based connectedness measures through topology structure analysis can identify and quantify the financial crisis, serving as significant systemic risk indicators. In addition, different systemic risk measures employed in our framework can identify similar rankings of risky financial firms quantitatively, which provide references for regulations. 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,2019-01-01,44,International Review of Economics and Finance,causal complex network; interconnectedness; marginal expected shortfall (mes); systemic risk,"Gong, X.-L.

"Gatfaoui, H.; de, P.P.",Flickering in information spreading precedes critical transitions in financial markets,"As many complex dynamical systems, financial markets exhibit sudden changes or tipping points that can turn into systemic risk. This paper aims at building and validating a new class of early warning signals of critical transitions. We base our analysis on information spreading patterns in dynamic temporal networks, where nodes are connected by short-term causality. Before a tipping point occurs, we observe flickering in information spreading, as measured by clustering coefficients. Nodes rapidly switch between ""being in"" and ""being out"" the information diffusion process. Concurrently, stock markets start to desynchronize. To capture these features, we build two early warning indicators based on the number of regime switches, and on the time between two switches. We divide our data into two sub-samples. Over the first one, using receiver operating curve, we show that we are able to detect a tipping point about one year before it occurs. For instance, our empirical model perfectly predicts the Global Financial Crisis. Over the second sub-sample, used as a robustness check, our two statistical metrics also capture, to a large extent, the 2016 financial turmoil.

The systemic risk metrics also decline with respect to expansion, though for the competition channel are more mixed, suggesting that systemic risk is more likely to be affected by country or business models characteristics that go beyond and above the differential intensity of competition between source and host markets.

The framework is based on a methodology popular in the social network literaturestochastic blockmodelingwhich, we argue, is more general, transparent and rewarding in terms of than other proposed methodologies. In particular, it allows us to identify the presence of multiple cores and peripheries as well as the different forms of interaction between them.We find that such a varied core-periphery structure exists in almost all periods for the different instruments analyzed. In the case of term deposits, which account for two-thirds of interbank exposures, we find that, far from being static, the structure underwent a transition in the period 2009-15, with the core increasing its size.We also show that facts revealed by our approach cannot be observed in the metrics commonly used to describe networks.

"Lin, L.; Guo, X.-Y.",Identifying fragility for the stock market: perspective from the portfolio overlaps network,"In a financial system, the interconnectedness among entities from investing in common assets (portfolio overlaps) is considered an important channel for the propagation of systemic risk because this interconnectedness can facilitate the contagion of fire sales and lead to widespread sales as well as spiral devaluation of assets. This mechanism also applies to the stock market. Particularly, it is responsible for the presence of fragility, which is defined as the potential global instability of stock prices when confronted by a local negative shock. Thus, we propose to quantitatively explore the temporal pattern of the topological features of the portfolio overlaps network (PON) to identify fragility, with the aim of either capturing a precursor for imminent market crashes or confirming further downward falls during market turmoil. Here, PON is the projected monopartite network used to characterise the mutual overlaps between funds pairs, which is induced from the bipartite network of stocks-funds ownerships. Further, we adopt a solid statistical procedure to construct the validated PON by filtering out mildly risky connections that are not statistically robust. Based on an empirical investigation of the Chinese stock market from 2005 to 2018 that witnessed collective unquenchable price slumps, we found that the topology of the validated PON can indeed provide some sensible indicators for identifying market fragility. The suggest that (i) the average closeness centrality and the critical value of effective infection rate could serve as leading indicators of impending market turmoil, and (ii) the simple degree-based measure for nodes and relative frequency measures for links are actual synchronous indicators that could also explain the source of fragility. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2019-01-01,4,"Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money",fragility; market crash; network theory; portfolio overlaps; stock market; systemic risks,"Lin, L.

Resources are not increasing despite a 5% increase in the numbers of PWD nationwide each year. We describe the rationale, design and methodology for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the safety, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of personalised variable-interval risk-based screening for DR. This is the first randomised trial of personalised screening for DR and the largest ophthalmic RCT in the UK. Methods and analysis PWD attending seven screening clinics in the Liverpool Diabetic Eye Screening Programme were recruited into a single site RCT with a 1:1 allocation to individualised risk-based variable-interval or annual screening intervals. A risk calculation engine developed for the trial estimates the probability that an individual will develop referable disease (screen positive DR) within the next 6, 12 or 24 months using demographic, retinopathy and systemic risk factor data from primary care and screening programme records. Dynamic, secure, real-time data connections have been developed. The primary outcome is attendance for follow-up screening. We will test for equivalence in attendance rates between the two arms. Secondary outcomes are rates and severity of DR, visual outcomes, cost-effectiveness and health-related quality of life. The required sample size was 4460 PWD. Recruitment is complete, and the trial is in follow-up.

"Anagnostopoulos, Y.; Kabeega, J.",Insider perspectives on european banking challenges in the post-crisis regulation environment,"The purpose of this paper is to make a highly topical and practical contribution by investigating the interplay between capital and liquidity risk management and managerial decision making in banking, following the Basel III for enhancing the safeguards against systemic risk. Specifically, we attempt to gauge the experience and assess the degree of tensions among banking practitioners’ perspectives on the reformed banking liquidity practice and risk-capital management in light of the newly introduced increased capital and liquidity requirements, which are to become fully and unilaterally effective as of 2019. As currently seen the liquidity provision requirement has become a distinct form of sharing’ financial risks in the global economy, which includes the supply of capital from its issuers. This article reviews the issue from a European perspective attempting to gain insight into: (1) the suggestion that the new regulations lack internal consistency owed to their complexity, which creates the potential for both inter- and intra-company regulatory capital arbitrage and credit constriction and (2) the suggestion that increased capital and liquidity requirements may have a significant impact on bank behaviour and or certain business model segments. Both of the above can potentially distort managerial behaviour through altering managerial incentives and hence fail to adequately regulate bank behaviour. With regard to the liquidity requirements, whilst we do not attempt to quantifiably assess the degree to which liquidity regulations (the liquidity coverage ratio in particular LCR henceforth) affect returns on equity assets to banks, our interviews are used as a triangulating measure for complementing quantitative studies that can provide a further insight into the perception of affecting managerial incentives. We aim to add to, update, and enrich the studies around the vital research question of whether the new regulation and liquidity standards can achieve their ultimate of upholding financial soundness and stability. Therefore, this research is important to complete the extant literature on updated insiders’ perspectives that investigate the effectiveness of the new regulatory framework imminently to be fully applicable by 2019. Where the views of the professionals who have voiced their concerns, support, and or proposals provide for a material contribution, these have also been provided. 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",2019,2019-01-01,5,Journal of Banking Regulation,liquidity; managerial behaviour; regulation; regulatory capital,"Anagnostopoulos, Y.

"Beyhaghi, M.; Nguyen, C.; Wald, J.K.",Institutional investors and loan dynamics: evidence from loan renegotiations,"We examine the probability of exit for different types of investors in the syndicated loan market, as well as how the entry and exit of different types of investors is associated with changes in loan characteristics. Nonbanks, particularly CLOs, closed-end funds, and mutual funds, are more likely than bank lenders to exit the syndicate rather than to participate in the renegotiated loan. For mutual funds, greater net fund outflows imply a greater likelihood of exit, and this finding is consistent with nonbank lending creating greater systemic risk (Stein 2013). For most nonbanks, the likelihood of an exit increases if the financial condition of the borrower improves and the potential for higher spreads wanes. Controlling for borrower risk, the addition of most nonbank institutions, in contrast to banks, is accompanied by an increase in loan spreads, but no significant increase in the number or tightness of covenants. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2019-01-01,7,Journal of Corporate Finance,funding risk; loan path; loan renegotiation; nonbank institutional investors; syndicated loans,"Beyhaghi, M.

"Kusnetsov, M.; Veraart, L.A.M.",Interbank clearing in financial networks with multiple maturities,"We consider the problem of systemic risk assessment in interbank networks in which interbank liabilities can have multiple maturities. In particular, we allow for both short-term and long-term interbank liabilities. We develop a clearing mechanism for the interbank liabilities to deal with the default of one or more market participants. Our approach generalizes the clearing approach for the single maturity setting proposed by Eisenberg and Noe Management Sci., 47 (2001), pp. 236-249Our clearing mechanism focuses on the vector of each bank's liquid assets at each maturity date and develops a fixed-point formulation of this vector for a given set of defaulted banks. Our formulation is consistent with the main stylized principles of insolvency law. We show that in the context of multiple maturities, specifying a set of defaulted banks is challenging. We propose two approaches to overcome this challenge: First, we propose an algorithmic approach for defining the default set and show that this approach leads to a well-defined liquid asset vector for all financial networks with multiple maturities. Second, we propose a simpler functional approach which leads to a functional liquid asset vector which need not exist but under a regularity condition does exist and coincides with the algorithmic liquid asset vector. Our analysis permits construction of simple dynamic models and furthermore demonstrates that systemic risk can be underestimated by single maturity models. 2019 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.",2019,2019-01-01,22,Siam Journal on Financial Mathematics,clearing; default; financial network; multiple maturities; systemic risk,"Kusnetsov, M.

We observe that when a region is more connected to other regions, it is exposed to a higher level of systemic risk. This condition holds even more strongly for non-systemically important regions. However, for SIRs, interconnectedness is not significantly associated with systemic risk. Our empirical evidence suggests that an increase in interconnectedness at the regional level, together with a decrease in interconnectedness for a single pivotal center, may reduce the aggregate systemic risk at the global level. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2019-01-01,6,Pacific Basin Finance Journal,interconnectedness; networks; systemic risk; systemically important regions,"Fang, L.

"Chadwick, M.G.; Ozturk, H.",Measuring financial systemic stress for turkey: A search for the best composite indicator,"In this study, we aim to construct a single financial stress indicator (FSI) for Turkey adopting weekly data from between April 2005 and December 2016. To do so, we compose 15 different FSIs using 14 variables that will represent five different markets, i.e. the money market, the bond market, the foreign exchange market, the equity market and the banking sector. We aggregate these five different markets using a variety of techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), basic portfolio theory, variance equal weights and the Bayesian dynamic factor model. We compare 15 different FSIs on the basis of their relation to, and the forecasting power of, different variables such as the growth rate of industrial production, the OECD business condition index and the OECD composite leading indicator for Turkey. Our suggest that there is no simple best indicator for Turkey to measure financial systemic stress. Some indicators offer good forecasting power for economic growth while others have a stronger correlation with systemic risk. Therefore, we offer a final FSI for Turkey conducting a model averaging method via a rolling correlation based weighting scheme to benefit from the information content of all the FSIs and observe that the final FSI successfully indicates the tension periods. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2019-01-01,8,Economic Systems,aggregation methods; bayesian dynamic factor model; composite indicator of systemic stress; financial stress indicators; portfolio theory; principal component analysis,"Chadwick, M.G.

The interbank network of each year is constructed by means of the yearly interbank assets and liabilities of twenty-eight Chinese banks. The show that the twenty-eight banks in China are closely connected through interbank networks. We compute the risk contribution of each bank and the expected systemic losses by using the differential Debt-Rank method. We find that the interconnectedness of a bank is highly significant to its systemic risk: banks with high eigenvector centrality contribute more systemic risk. Banks with high returns on assets and low liquidity also contribute more systemic risk. The overall systemic risk changes over time and reaches high levels in 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2012. In high-risk years, the risk contribution of small-scale banks significantly increases.

"Zhang, X.; Valdez, L.D.; Stanley, H.E.; Braunstein, L.A.",Modeling risk contagion in the venture capital market: A multilayer network approach,"Venture capital plays a critical role in spurring innovation, encouraging entrepreneurship, and generating wealth. As a part of the financial market, venture capital is affected by market downturns and economic cycles, but it also creates bubbles that negatively impact the economy and social stability. Although the venture capital market is a potential source of systemic risk, there has been little study of its contagion risk mechanism, or how the failure of a single market participant can threaten systemic stability. We use a multilayer network analysis to model the risk contagion in a venture capital market when an external shock impacts a venture capital firm or start-up company in order to understand how risk can spread through connections between market participants and harm total market robustness. We use our model to describe both the direct and indirect channels in the venture capital market that propagates risk and loss. Using real data from the worldwide venture capital market, we find that the venture capital market exhibits the same ""robust-yet-fragile"" feature as other financial systems. The coupling effect of direct and indirect risk contagions can cause abrupt transitions and large-scale damage even when the turbulence is minor. We also find that the network structure, connectivity, and cash position distribution of market participants impact market robustness. Our study complements other emerging research on measuring systemic risk through multiple connections among market players and on the feedback risk contagion between the financial industry and the real economy. 2019 X.

Here, we address the more general problem of how shock propagation dynamics depend on the topological details of the underlying network. To this end, we consider different realistic network topologies, all consistent with balance sheet information obtained from real data on financial institutions. In particular, we consider networks of varying density and with different block structures. In addition, we diversify in the details of the shock propagation dynamics.

"Gai, P.; Kapadia, S.",Networks and systemic risk in the financial system,The complex web of exposures and interlinkages across the financial system highlights the relevance of network analysis in understanding systemic risk and guiding the design of financial regulation. This paper discusses how network models-and those based on epidemiological approaches in particular-offer a compelling description of the structure of real-world financial systems and shed light on different contagion mechanisms seen during the global financial crisis. We also review how these insights may inform macroprudential risk assessment and policy in the areas of stress-testing the financial system and the regulation of systemically important institutions. The role of non-bank financial intermediation and social networks in shaping financial system risk is also briefly considered. 2019 The Author(s).

We show how to improve the forecasting accuracy of the co-movement of energy and stock prices in an equally weighted portfolio. Contrary to prior findings, we demonstrate that due to the different co-movements across the GCC stock indices, portfolios of oil assets and several GCC stocks are less likely to be affected by systemic risk. The different co-movements across several stock indices over time provide different entry and exit points for stock investors.

Immediate reactions to restore liquidity and provide fiscal stimulus rescued Western economies. However, they did not address root causes of the crash. We demonstrate that issues such as regulatory capture and moral hazard were recognised in the US banking system as far back as the late nineteenth century, and that ensuing reforms were inadequate and sometimes reversed. Financial innovation and globalisation have led to evolving and complex capital markets, leaving regulation behind. Financial instability helps to foster anti-globalisation, populist, and protectionist movements.

"Mets, E.J.; Chouairi, F.; Torabi, S.J.; Alperovich, M.",Predictors of adverse events following cleft palate repair,"Cleft palate repair has rare, but potentially life-threatening risks. Understanding the risk factors for adverse events following cleft palate repair can guide surgeons in risk stratification and parental counseling. Methods: Patients underyears of age in National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatric Database (NSQIP-P) from 2012 to 2016 who underwent primary cleft palate repair were identified. Risk factors for adverse events after cleft palate repair were identified.Outcomes for 4989 patients were reviewed. Mean age was 1.0 0.3 years and 53.5% were males. Adverse events occurred in 6.4% (320) of patients. The wound dehiscence rate was 3.1%, and the reoperation rate was 0.9%. On multivariate analysis, perioperative blood transfusion (adjusted odds ratio aOR 30.2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia chronic lung disease (aOR 2.2), and prolonged length of stay (LOS) (aOR 1.1) were significantly associated with an adverse event. When subdivided by type of adverse event, reoperation was associated with perioperative blood transfusion (aOR 286.5), cerebral palsy (aOR 11.3), and prolonged LOS (aOR 1.1). Thirty-day readmission was associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification class III (aOR 2.0) and IV (aOR 4.8), bronchopulmonary dysplasia chronic lung disease (aOR 2.5), cerebral palsy (aOR 5.7), and prolonged LOS (aOR 1.1). Finally, wound dehiscence was significantly associated with perioperative blood transfusion only (aOR 8.2).Although adverse events following cleft palate surgery are rare, systemic disease remains the greatest predictor for readmission and reoperation. Neurologic and pulmonary diseases are the greatest systemic risk factors. Intraoperative adverse events requiring blood transfusion are the greatest surgical risk factor for post-surgical complications. Copyright 2019 by Mutaz B.

Methods: In this 5-year retrospective study, Baseline characteristics, systemic risk factors, and findings of ROP screening were noted. Factors associated with severe ROP including aggressive posterior ROP (APROP), stage IV andROP were analyzed. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 20.Of 763 babies screened, 30% were diagnosed to have ROP. Prevalence of severe ROP was 14.2% (109) of which 60 (55.5%) were classic and 30 (27.7%) were APROP. Eighteen (16.6%) were diagnosed as advanced ROP (stage IV and V). Mean gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) for severe ROP were 31.05 weeks and 1.34 kg, respectively which were inversely associated with severe ROP. But a significant 10% of severe ROP were seen in late preterm babies, 34 weeks. Low GA and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were significant risk factors for APROP. Most important factor for stage IV andROP was late presentation for screening. Conclusion: The study found a high prevalence of severe ROP including APROP. Almost 7% severe ROP cases were outside screening guidelines of NNF.

"Lo, S.D.R.; Thurner, S.; Sorger, J.; Duftschmid, G.; Endel, G.; Klimek, P.",Quantification of the resilience of primary care networks by stress testing the health care system,"There are practically no quantitative tools for understanding how much stress a health care system can absorb before it loses its ability to provide care. We propose to measure the resilience of health care systems with respect to changes in the density of primary care providers. We develop a computational model on a 1-to-1 scale for a countrywide primary care sector based on patient-sharing networks. Nodes represent all primary care providers in a country links indicate patient flows between them. The removal of providers could cause a cascade of patient displacements, as patients have to find alternative providers. The model is calibrated with nationwide data from Austria that includes almost all primary care contacts overy. We assignproperties to every provider: the CareRank measures the average number of displacements caused by a provider’s removal (systemic risk) as well as the fraction of patients a provider can absorb when others default (systemic benefit). Below a critical number of providers, large-scale cascades of patient displacements occur, and no more providers can be found in a given region. We quantify regional resilience as the maximum fraction of providers that can be removed before cascading events prevent coverage for all patients within a district. We find considerable regional heterogeneity in the critical transition point from resilient to nonresilient behavior. We demonstrate that health care resilience cannot be quantified by physician density alone but must take into account how networked systems respond and restructure in response to shocks. The approach can identify systemically relevant providers. 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

However, relevant research has ignored the systemic risk in dynamic banking network systems and the effects of inter-bank lending ratio (the ratio of interbank lending assets to total assets) and the asset volatility on the systemic risk in the dynamic banking networks. For this, the present paper constructs a dynamic evolutional banking network system firstly, which contains the dynamic evolutional equation of banks' assets and liabilities and the dynamic clear algorithm of banks default. Then we analyze the systemic risk in the dynamic evolutional banking network system. The show that when lending ratio is small, the systemic risk of the banking system will change greatly with different market volatility. The greater the volatility, the higher probability of default that are mainly basic default when the volatility is larger, it can reduce the systemic risk through increased lending ratios when the volatility is smaller, it need to reduce lending ratios to reduce the systemic risk when the volatility reaches a particular critical value, the relevant departments need to control other factors (such as capital adequacy ratio) to reduce the systemic risk. 2019 IEEE.",2019,2019-01-01,1,"Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management, Iesm 2019",capital adequacies; default probabilities; default probability; finance; global financial crisis; interbank lending; market volatility; probability of defaults; research issues; risk evolution; risks; systemic risk; systemic risks,"Hong, F.

"Squires, G.; White, I.",Resilience and housing markets: who is it really for,"Ten years after the Global Financial Crisis, this research examines how resilience theory and rhetoric relating to the economy and housing markets has been translated into policy and practice. The methodology involves a case study of a city (Auckland) with a nationally dominant housing market and high unaffordability. Via secondary literature and a series of interviews we analyse questions connected to resilience from what, how, by whom, and discuss the implications and limits of the approach. The research demonstrates that resilience policies have focused on providing institutional stability to shock, rather than adaptation or transformation to a state that is less exposed to the systemic risks associated with flows of global capital, debt, and speculative activity. This is related to how the whole concept is vaguely defined. In the absence of guidance, institutions reinterpret resilience in a way that underpins existing market and regulatory logics, such as by increasing capital reserves or lending ratios. As a consequence, the dominant political economy, selected institutions, and to an extent, existing homeowners and speculative investors are privileged in resilience policy. By bringing these selectivities and limits to light we argue for a shift in focus away from an institutional frame to one with a deeper understanding of both the balance of an economy and the wider forces that create and reproduce housing markets. 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,2019-01-01,11,Land Use Policy,auckland [north island]; economic instability; economy; financial crisis; homeownership; housing market; housing markets; housing policy; institutional framework; investment; new zealand; north island; political economy; property; property rights; resilience,"Squires, G.

"Duan, Y.; Ye, Y.; Liu, Z.",Risk assessment for enterprise merger and acquisition via multiple classifier fusion,"This paper aims to solve the problem of Risk assessment for enterprise merger and acquisition (M A), which is an important problem in modern company management. Firstly, we design an index system to assess risks of enterpriseA behavior, and six risks are considered: 1) Systemic risk, 2) Law risk, 3) Financial risk, 4) Intermediary risk, 5) Integrated risk, and 6) Information risk. Furthermore, 18 indexes are chosen to cover these six aspects. Secondly, we illustrate how to utilize the proposed risk assessment in the decision system for enterpriseA risk assessment. We separate theA risk assessment process to three steps, that is, 1) BeforeA, and 2) InA, and 3) AfterA. Particularly, after the risk assessment process, there are three decisions for enterprise managers, that is, 1) implement the originalA plan, 2) modify the originalA plan, and 3) refuse it. Thirdly, we propose the multiple classifier fusion based risk assessment algorithm, which aims to effectively combine the six support vector machines. To relax the limitation of the SVM classifier, we introduce the fuzzy theory in the multiple classifier fusion algorithm, and the category label assignment is determined by utilizing a maximum membership rule. Finally, we conduct an experiment to make performance evaluation by constructing a dataset which includes theA data of 200 enterprises, among which 185 enterprises are used as training dataset and others are regarded as testing dataset. Using ROC curve, MAE and MAPE as evaluation criterions, performance of the proposed method is compared with single SVM scheme. Experimental demonstrate that combining multiple the SVM classifiers together, accuracy ofA risk assessment is greatly enhanced. 2019 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

"Wilson, T.C.",Risk landscape 10 years on: the end of systemic risk or a new beginning,"Risk professionals currently put systemic economic risk at its lowest level since 2008, potentially owing to systemic regulatory reform and monetary policy, which have remediated issues with consumer and bank sector balance sheets. In spite of this progress, there is an argument to be made that systemic risk is actually increasing, but driven today by the public sector through high-risk monetary and public policy. The changing source of potential future systemic risks brings into question the potential effectiveness of systemic regulation. Fortunately, best risk management practices remain the same regardless of the source of the next systemic crisis, including stress testing, defining systemic risk appetite and building resilience.

"Deku, S.Y.; Kara, A.; Zhou, Y.","Securitization, bank behaviour and financial stability: A systematic review of the recent empirical literature","We systematically review the recent empirical literature to investigate whether and how securitization influences bank behaviour and its implication on financial stability. We find that, in the years preceding the 2007 2009 financial crisis, banks with higher credit and market risk were more likely to securitize assets. Banks became riskier and increased systemic risk as they took advantage of securitization in order to obtain capital relief. There is robust evidence indicating that mortgage securitization led to a deterioration in bank lending standards via weaker screening, lower denial rates, and misreporting of credit quality. For corporate loan securitization, the empirical findings on lax bank lending are inconclusive. However, it is evident that securitization resulted in poorer ex-post bank monitoring of corporate borrowers. Even though Europe is the second largest securitization market, there is a dearth of evidence on the impact of securitization on European banks' lending behaviour. Research is also very limited on the post-crisis regulatory incentive aligning mechanisms such as the risk retention requirements and the credit ratings reform. Finally, evidence on securitization activity in emerging markets, such as Latin America and China, where securitization volumes have been increasing recently, is relatively non-existent. 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2019,2019-01-01,20,International Review of Financial Analysis,bank behaviour; financial stability; securitization,"Deku, S.Y.

"Usoskin, V.M.",Shadow banking: regulatory reform and its effectiveness,"Over the past three decades, a large group of non-bank financial institutions has been formed in the world economy. These institutions fall outside the realm of traditional banking and take an active part in the lending processes of economic turnover entities. The activities of these institutions, called the shadow banking system (SBS), led to an increase in systemic risks and had a negative impact on the state of the global financial system. This was distinctly displayed during the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. The subject of this article is a series of measures taken by the international and national financial control bodies after the financial crisis to eliminate most risky aspects of shadow banking and to strengthen the system of financial oversight and monitoring. The final aim of the analysis is to evaluate effectiveness of the measures on strengthening control and limiting risks applied by the control bodies of the G-20 countries in the course of the reform to enterprises of the traditional and shadow sectors of the financial system. The of the analysis show that the reform strengthened positions of traditional banks and improved their ability to resist financial shocks. As to the shadow banking sector, contrary to the statements of the initiators of the reform the regulative measures did not eliminate the systemic risks peculiar to nonbank financial institutions and did not stop their growing activities.

"Dzhagityan, E.",Shaping the EAEU's institutional framework for banking regulation: perspectives and risks,"The institutional aspect of post-crisis banking regulation reform (Basel III) remains unsettled, and as such undermines regulators' efforts to shape a seamless platform for international financial intermediation. The lack of global acceptance of the Basel III standards amid the internationalization of banking activities is one of the main reasons for regulatory asymmetries which are difficult to handle at the national level. In this context, the efforts of governments and financial regulators are a central core of their policy in protecting banking sectors from systemic risks. It becomes imperative to bring together national mechanisms of banking regulation and to develop a regional system of regulatory institutions, as is evidenced by the single supervisory mechanism in the eurozone countries. Strengthening stress-resilience of the national banking sectors in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the expansion of banking activities to the Eurasian economy will require a conceptual framework of the EAEU banking regulation system. However, different regulatory regimes in EAEU states along with the lack of supranational regulatory institutions may slow the progress of the Eurasian mechanism of banking regulation. This means that operationalization of the EAEU regulatory mechanism will depend on whether the mini-Basel III format as a methodological hub of regionalization and supranationalization will act as an enabler of a resolution to the regulatory trilemma of the feasibility, relevance and opportunities of supranationalization. The institutional aspect of mini-Basel III is intrinsically linked to the integrity and consistency of the supranational authority for regulation of EAEU financial markets being an authority documented in the treaty on the EAEU however, the costs of regulatory alignment may exceed the advantages of a single-institution regulatory architecture owing to the existent and tacit risks from the heterogeneity of the national regulatory models. Stemming from the complex financial sector environment that falls short of valid and reliable institutional fundamentals, this article proposes alternative scenarios for the EAEU regulatory mechanism that could be sought for optimization of regulatory logistics and algorithms of regulatory alignment. Based on systematization of the benefits and weaknesses of each of the scenarios as well as on a comparative analysis as to whether the proposed scenarios would ensure a continuum of financial intermediation and financial stability, this article concludes that currently there are no priority approaches to the design of a supranational institutional system in the EAEU. At the same time, the identical structure of national banking sectors together with the least expensive scenario approach could underpin the process of regulatory supranationalization however, to secure the integrity of the EAEU supranational authority, it should be complemented with an authority that would be responsible for the coordination of EAEU-wide regulatory alignment. 2019, National Research University Higher School of Economics.",2019,2019-01-01,0,International Organisations Research Journal,banking regulation institutes; basel iii; eurasian economic union (eaeu); integration; international banking regulation; mini-basel iii; supranationalization; systemic risks,"Dzhagityan, E.

"Dastkhan, H.; Gharneh, N.S.",Simulation of contagion in the stock markets using cross-shareholding networks: A case from an emerging market,"In recent years, simulation of contagion in financial markets is one of the main concerns of the economic and finance researchers and policy makers in order to analyze the effects of different shocks on the contagion. In this paper, we introduce a simulation model to analyze the contagion in financial markets based on the cross-shareholding network of firms. In order to validate the proposed model, we investigate the of a real dataset from an emerging market. According to different kinds of idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks to the system, we analyze the probability and the extent of contagion. Moreover, to study the effect of market structure, the of different null models are compared with the real network. The show that the proposed simulation model and the cross-shareholding network are effectively appropriate in the analysis of contagion and systemic risk in the financial systems. The of null models indicate that the structural characteristics of the financial networks have significant role in the spread of shocks and financial crisis.

"Khan, F.; Yang, Z.",Simulation of financial systemic risk and contagion in thes housing market,"This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to model systemic risk in the housing market from 1986 to 2017. We provide a unique approach to simulating the financial market along with demonstrating the phenomenon of emergence resulting from the interconnected-behavior of consumers, banks and the Federal Reserve. Consumers can buy or rent properties, and these agents own characteristics such as income and may be employed or unemployed. Banks own balance sheets to monitor their assets and liabilities and participate in the interbank lending market with one another. This tool can assess the complexity of the United States’ housing market, conduct stress tests as interest rates fluctuate, and explore the landmark financial crisis and epidemic of foreclosures. This is important because understanding the impact from increases in foreclosed properties and changes in rates can help policymakers and bankers have a better understanding of the complexity within the housing market.

By adopting a recursive partitioning strategy, we detect specific risk zones varying from safe to high risk based on key predictors, and we construct their specification by assigning specific risk thresholds. While key macroeconomic fundamentals such as Debt GDP and the unemployment rate remained the same and maintained the same risk thresholds during the sub-periods 2008 2013 and 2013 2017, the CDS spreads contagion dropped significantly over the post-Quantitative Easing years, lowering the corresponding risk thresholds.

"Jore, S.H.",Standardization of terrorism risk analysis: A means or an obstacle to achieving security,"In Norway, several standards and guidelines for how to conduct security risk analysis have been published, in parallel with new functional regulations and a descaling of counterterrorism responsibility. The aim of this chapter is to discuss whether terrorism is a risk suitable for standardization. We ask whether standardization will lead to a secure society or if it can hamper security. We conclude that, although standardization of terrorism management will contribute to a more hegemonic cross-organizational and cross-sectoral risk management regime, trapping a systemic risk such as terrorism into fixed categories entails that the risk of terrorism is made predictable, value-free, and subsequently the risk of terrorism is simplified and depoliticized. Hence, standardization of terrorism risk involves paradoxes, meaning that it is not evident that standardization of terrorism risk management will lead to greater security. 2020 selection and editorial matter, Odd Einar Olsen, Kirsten Juhl, Preben H.

"Silva, A.F.",Strategic liquidity mismatch and financial sector stability,"This paper examines whether banks strategically incorporate their competitors' liquidity mismatch policies when determining their own and the impact of these collective decisions on financial stability. Using a novel identification strategy exploiting the presence of partially overlapping peer groups,show that banks' liquidity transformation activity is driven by that of their peers. These correlated decisions are concentrated on the asset side of riskier banks and are asymmetric, with mimicking occurring only when competitors take more risk. Accordingly, this strategic behavior increases banks' default risk and overall systemic risk, highlighting the importance of regulating liquidity risk from a macroprudential perspective.

"Bernardi, M.; Catania, L.",Switching generalized autoregressive score copula models with application to systemic risk,"Recent financial disasters have emphasized the need to accurately predict extreme financial losses and their consequences for the institutions belonging to a given financial market. The ability of econometric models to predict extreme events strongly relies on their flexibility to account for the highly nonlinear and asymmetric dependence patterns observed in financial time series. In this paper, we develop a new class of flexible copula models where the dependence parameters evolve according to a Markov switching generalized autoregressive score (GAS) dynamics. Maximum likelihood estimation is performed using a two-step procedure where the second step relies on the expectation maximization algorithm. The proposed switching GAS copula models are then used to estimate the conditional value at risk and the conditional expected shortfall, measuring the impact on an institution of extreme events affecting another institution or the market. The empirical investigation, conducted on a panel of European regional portfolios, reveals that the proposed model is able to explain and predict the evolution of the systemic risk contributions over the period 1999 2015. 2018 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.",2019,2019-01-01,31,Journal of Applied Econometrics,,"Bernardi, M.

"Scheibe, K.P.; Blackhurst, J.",Systemic risk and the ripple effect in the supply chain,"Supply chains are highly complex systems, and disruptions may ripple through these systems in unexpected ways, but they may also start in unexpected ways. We investigate the causes of ripple effect through the lens of systemic risk. We derive supply chain systemic risk from the finance discipline where sources of risk are found in systemic risk-taking, contagion, and amplification mechanisms. In a supply chain context, we identify three dimensions that influence systemic risk, the nature of a disruption, the structure, and dependency of the supply chain, and the decision-making. Within these three dimensions, there are several factors including correlation of risk, compounding effects, cyclical linkages, counterparty risk, herding behavior, and misaligned incentives. These factors are often invisible to decision makers, and they may operate in tandem to exacerbate ripple effect. We highlight these systemic risks, and we encourage further research to understand their nature and to mitigate their effect. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,2019-01-01,8,International Series in Operations Research and Management Science,,"Scheibe, K.P.

"Fatone, L.; Mariani, F.",Systemic risk governance in a dynamical model of a banking system,"We consider the problem of governing systemic risk in a banking system model. The banking system model consists in an initial value problem for a system of stochastic differential equations whose dependent variables are the log-monetary reserves of the banks as functions of time. The banking system model considered generalizes previous models studied in Fouque and Sun (in: Fouque and Langsam (eds) Handbook of systemic risk, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 444 452, 2013), Carmona et al. (Commun Math Sci 13(4):911 933, 2015), Garnier et al. (SIAMFinanc Math 4:151 184, 2013) and describes an homogeneous population of banks. Two distinct mechanisms are used to model the cooperation among banks and the cooperation between banks and monetary authority. These mechanisms are regulated respectively by the parametersand γ. A bank fails when its log-monetary reserves go below an assigned default level. We call systemic risk or systemic event in a bounded time interval the fact that in that time interval at least a given fraction of the banks fails. The probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is evaluated using statistical simulation. A method to govern the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval is presented. The goal of the governance is to keep the probability of systemic risk in a bounded time interval between two given thresholds. The governance is based on the choice of the log-monetary reserves of a kind of ideal bank as a function of time and on the solution of an optimal control problem for the mean field approximation of the banking system model. The solution of the optimal control problem determines the parametersandas functions of time, that is defines the rules of the borrowing and lending activity among banks and between banks and monetary authority. Some numerical examples are discussed. In particular during a two year period we consider the governance of systemic risk in the next year when governance decisions are taken quarterly. The systemic risk governance is tested in absence and in presence of positive and negative shocks acting on the banking system. 2019, Springer Science Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,2019-01-01,3,Journal of Global Optimization,cambridge university; initial value problems; mean field; mean field approximation; online systems; optimal control problem; optimal control systems; risks; statistical simulation; stochastic control systems; stochastic differential equations; stochastic models; stochastic optimal control; stochastic systems; systemic risk; systemic risks,"Fatone, L.

"Jiang, S.; Fan, H.",Systemic risk in the interbank market with overlapping portfolios,"The increasing frequency and scope of the financial crisis have attracted more attention in the research of the systemic risk of banking system. A new model for the interbank market with overlapping portfolios is proposed to simulate a banking system in this work. The proposed model uses a bipartite network of banks and their assets to analyze the impact of bank investment on the stability of the banking system. In addition, this model introduces investment risk and allows banks to make up for liquidity by selling devaluated assets, which reflects the operating rules of the banking system more realistically. The show that allowing banks to sell devaluated assets to make up for liquidity can improve the stability of the banking system and the interbank market can also improve the stability of the banking system. For the investment of banks, the investment risk is an uncertain factor that affects the stability of the banking system. The proposed model further analyzes the impact of average investment interest rate, savings interest rate, deposit reserve ratio, and investment asset diversity on the stability of the banking system. The model provides a tool for policy-makers and supervision agencies to prevent the systemic risk of banking system. Copyright 2019 Shanshan Jiang and Hong Fan.

"Rösing, C.K.; Fiorini, T.; Haas, A.N.; Muniz, F.W.M.G.; Oppermann, R.V.; Susin, C.",The impact of maintenance on peri-implant health,"Most of the literature evaluating dental implants focuses on implant survival, which is a limited proxy for the successful rehabilitation of patients with missing teeth. Success should include not only survival but also lack of mechanical, biological, and esthetics problems. A comprehensive review of local and systemic risk factors prior to implant placement will allow the tailoring of treatment planning and maintenance protocols to the patient's profile in order to achieve longitudinal success of the therapy. This review discusses the role of controlling different risk factors and prevention treatment of peri-implant mucositis in order to avoid peri-implantitis. Although the literature addressing the topic is still scarce, the existing evidence shows that performing optimal plaque control and regular visits to the dentist seem to be adequate to prevent peri-implant lesions. Due to impossibility of defining a probing depth associate with peri-implant health, radiographic evaluations may be considered in the daily practice. So far, there is a strong evidence linking a past history of periodontal disease to peri-implant lesions, but this is not so evident for other factors including smoking and diabetes. The prevention of biological complications starts even before implant placement and include a broader analysis of the patient risk profile and tailoring the rehabilitation and maintenance protocols accordingly. It should be highlighted that the installation of implants does not modify the patient profile, since it does not modify genetics, microbiology or behavioral habits of any individual.

"Bu, H.; Tang, W.; Wu, J.",Time-varying comovement and changes of comovement structure in the chinese stock market: A causal network method,"The driving force for the comovement in stock returns is a long-standing debate between classical asset pricing theory and behavioral finance theory. It has become critically important recently for understanding systemic risk and risk contagion in the market. In this study, we propose complex networks enabled new methods to measure the causal comovement of individual stocks and the comovement structure of the market, which facilitate the examination of all kinds of hypotheses of comovement theories in a unified framework. Using a sample of the Chinese stock market from Jan. 1, 2006 to Dec. 31, 2016, we find that the degree of comovement generally intensifies over time, with a drastic increase from 2011 to 2015, while the comovement structure of the market changes with different market situations. Most importantly, our study reveals the driving force of causal comovement among individual stocks that is, sentiment-based factors related to the market index indeed induce excess causal comovement in returns beyond that can be justified by fundamental factors including beta coefficient, book-to-market ratio, liquidity, profitability and volatility. Our study also reveals the determinants of comovement structure, which are attributable to the change of investors' behaviors in different periods. It turns out that investors in the Chinese stock market care about risk-return relationship in normal periods, while they seem to care only about risk in crisis periods. 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2019-01-01,13,Economic Modelling,common factors; comovement measure; comovement structure; panel data model; topology of causal network,"Bu, H.

"Karaś, M.; Szczepaniak, W.",Towards a generalized measure of systemic risk: systemic turbulence measure,"Systemic risk, a concept closely related to financial system stability, has three major areas of concern: systemic liquidity, systemic fragility and risk spill-over (contagion). In the recent years there were many measures of systemic risk proposed in the literature, however, as can be shown after literature investigation and proven from their theoretical properties, none of these measures truly reflects all three mentioned characteristics of systemic risk. The paper provides a comparative analysis of these characteristics based on empirical data for Poland spanning from the year 2006 to 2016, encompassing the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, and proposes a method of combining them into one aggregated measurement, using the concept of Mahalanobis distance, following the concept of financial turbulence measure proposed by Kritzman and Li (Financ Anal66:30 41, 2010). The aggregation procedure leads to postulation of a new systemic risk measurement method, called by the authors Systemic Turbulence Measure (STM). 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics,global financial crisis; mahalanobis distance; systemic risk; systemic turbulence measure,"Karaś, M.

"Dicks, D.L.; Fulghieri, P.",Uncertainty aversion and systemic risk,"We propose a new theory of systemic risk based on Knightian uncertaintyambiguity ). Because of uncertainty aversion, bad news on one asset class worsens investors’ expectations on other asset classes, so that idiosyncratic risk creates contagion, snowballing into systemic risk. In a Diamond and Dybvig setting, uncertainty-averse investors are less prone to run individual banks, but runs can be systemic and are associated with stock market crashes and flight to quality. Finally, increasing uncertainty makes the financial system more fragile and more prone to crises.

"Agosto, A.; Raffinetti, E.",Validation of PARX models for default count prediction,"The growing importance of financial technology platforms, based on interconnectedness, makes necessary the development of credit risk measurement models that properly take contagion into account. Evaluating the predictive accuracy of these models is achieving increasing importance to safeguard investors and maintain financial stability. The aim of this paper is two-fold. On the one hand, we provide an application of Poisson autoregressive stochastic processes to default data with the aim of investigating credit contagion on the other hand, focusing on the validation aspects, we assess the performance of these models in terms of predictive accuracy using both the standard metrics and a recently developed criterion, whose main advantage is being not dependent on the type of predicted variable. This new criterion, already validated on continuous and binary data, is extended also to the case of discrete data providing which are coherent to those obtained with the classical predictive accuracy measures. To shed light on the usefulness of our approach, we apply Poisson autoregressive models with exogenous covariates (PARX) to the quarterly count of defaulted loans among Italian real estate and construction companies, comparing the performance of several specifications. We find that adding a contagion component leads to a decisive improvement in model accuracy with respect to the only autoregressive specification.

"Khabazian, A.; Peng, J.",Vulnerability analysis of the financial network,"Since the financial crisis in 2007-2008, the vulnerability of a financial system has become a major concern in financial engineering. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of a financial network based on the linear optimization model introduced by Eisenberg and Noe Eisenberg L, Noe TH (2001) Systemic risk in financial systems. Management Sci. 47(2):236-249.in which the right-hand side of the constraints is subject to market shock and only limited information regarding the liability matrix is exposed. We develop a new extended sensitivity analysis to characterize the conditions under which a bank is solvent, in default, or bankrupted and estimate the probability of insolvency and the probability of bankruptcy under mild conditions on the market shock and the network structure. Particularly, we show that although an increment in the total asset may not be able to improve the stability of the financial system, a larger asset inequality in the system will reduce its stability. Moreover, under a certain assumption on the market shock and the network structure, we show that the least stable network can be attained at some network with a monopoly node, which also has the highest probability of insolvency. The probability of bankruptcy in the network when all the nodes receive shocks is estimated. We also estimate the impact of bankruptcy of the monopoly node in a well-balanced network and explore the domino effect of bankruptcy when the network has a tridiagonal structure.

Mounting pressures from the private sector are intensifying the risks associated with overtourism. The increasing strategic importance of PAs for the communities and regions in which they are situated requires improved management effectiveness yet, recent studies indicate significant and growing systemic risk. Worldview analysis can be a valuable tool for building consciousness and informing the evolution of PA planning and management. Directed content analysis was used to examine two Visitor Use Plans developed for the Coyhaique National Reserve, located in the iconic Patagonia cultural area of southern Chile. The plans were developed using distinct planning frameworks, with different underlying assumptions. Research questions focused on how modernist, postmodernist and integral worldviews were expressed within the two plans. Worldviews were explored in both manifest and latent manners, considering plan text, models and overall context revealing patterns and links between the plans and planning frameworks that guided their development. Rich context and a thorough discussion of methods assists with the incorporation of worldview evaluation within PA management theory, informing the continuing development of knowledge and capacities that can better prepare PAs for future challenges. 2019, 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2019,2019-01-01,17,Journal of Sustainable Tourism,aisen; aysén; chile; directed content analysis; ecotourism; environmental planning; holistic approach; holistic planning; integral theory; planning theory; protected area; protected area management; worldview,"Gale, T.

"Woodward, S.; Brindley, N.",A discussion on preventing corporate failure: learning from the UK construction crisis,"The global construction industry can learn lessons from UK corporate failures. In doing so the risk profile of infrastructure should improve as an asset class, making it less risky for investors. If top contractors diligently used more effective systemic risk management they would become even more attractive to investors, be it financial, or those who invest themselves through employment, as direct suppliers, or subcontractors, or through the supply chain. There is failure in effective 'fit-for-purpose' risk management at corporate and project levels. At corporate level there is compliance failure with the requirements of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in setting high quality corporate governance and stewardship codes for financial and investment reporting. The components needed to achieve better from the risk register and use of systemic risk management are: early risk identification properly considered risk sharing and ownership direct linking of risk ownership and reward and continuous risk feedback and evaluation through effective monitoring. 2019 John Wiley Sons Ltd.",2018,2018-01-01,0,Global Construction Success,compliance failure; financial reporting council; investment reporting; risk register; supply chain; systemic risk management; uk corporate failures,"Woodward, S.

"Shi, R.; Guo, Z.; Wang, F.; Li, R.; Zhao, L.; Lin, R.",Alterations in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in early stages of diabetic retinopathy and potential risk factors,"Aims: To investigate the loss of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in type-2 diabetic patients with early-stage diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to identify potential risk factors accounting for these alterations. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 158 type-2 diabetic patients were divided into three groups based on their DR status. RNFL thickness and other optic disc parameters were obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and then compared among different groups. We investigated the potential association between RNFL loss and systemic risk factors for DR, including diabetes duration, body mass index (BMI), serum lipids, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). One-way ANOVA was carried out to compare RNFL thickness among different groups, Pearson correlation and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed to determine potential risk factors related to RNFL thickness in these patients.There were significant differences in the average (F 8.872,0.003), superior (F 8.769,0.004), and inferior (F 8.857,0.003) RNFL thickness of both eyes among the groups, but no obvious difference in optic disc parameters was found. Diabetic duration, BMI, TG, High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), HbA1c, and ACR were found negatively related to the RNFL thickness in both or single eye according to Pearson correlation analysis. After controlling for age, gender, and axis length (AL) in multivariate linear regression analysis, the diabetic duration was associated significantly with RNFL thickness of superior in both eye (right eye:0.016, left eye:0.024), BMI was related to the nasal quadrant of the right eye (p 0.034), and TG was related to the inferior of the right eye (p 0.037), HbA1c (p 0.026) was associated significantly with the average RNFL thickness of the right eye. In addition, ACR was found negatively related to average (p 0.042) and inferior quadrant (p 0.014) of the left eye, respectively.RNFL loss might be the earliest structural change of retina in diabetic patients, and associated with diabetic duration, BMI, TG, HbA1c, and ACR.

"Di, G.D.; Lillo, F.; Pirino, D.",Assessing systemic risk due to fire sales spillover through maximum entropy network reconstruction,"Monitoring and assessing systemic risk in financial markets is of great importance but it often requires data that are unavailable or available at a very low frequency. For this reason, systemic risk assessment with partial information is potentially very useful for regulators and other stakeholders. In this paper we consider systemic risk due to fire sales spillovers and portfolio rebalancing by using the risk metrics defined by Greenwood et al. (2015). By using a method based on the constrained minimization of the Cross Entropy, we show that it is possible to assess aggregated and single bank's systemicness and vulnerability, using only the information on the size of each bank and the capitalization of each investment asset. We also compare our approach with an alternative widespread application of the Maximum Entropy principle allowing to derive graph probability distributions and generating scenarios and we use it to propose a statistical test for a change in banks’ vulnerability to systemic events. 2018 The Author(s)",2018,2018-01-01,22,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,financial networks; fire sales; liquidity; maximum entropy; systemic risk,"Di Gangi, D.

"Yu, P.-D.; Tan, C.W.; Fu, H.-L.",Averting cascading failures in networked infrastructures: poset-constrained graph algorithms,"Cascading failures in critical networked infrastructures that result even from a single source of failure often lead to rapidly widespread outages as witnessed in the 2013 Northeast blackout in Northern America. The ensuing problem of containing future cascading failures by placement of protection or monitoring nodes in the network is complicated by the uncertainty of the failure source and the missing observation of how the cascading might unravel, be it the past cascading failures or the future ones. This paper examines the problem of minimizing the outage when a cascading failure from a single source occurs. A stochastic optimization problem is formulated where a limited number of protection nodes, when placed strategically in the network to mitigate systemic risk, can minimize the expected spread of cascading failure. We propose the vaccine centrality, which is a network centrality based on the partially ordered sets (poset) characteristics of the stochastic program and distributed message-passing, to design efficient approximation algorithms with provable approximation ratio guarantees. In particular, we illustrate how the vaccine centrality and the poset-constrained graph algorithms can be designed to tradeoff between complexity and optimality, as illustrated through a series of numerical experiments. This paper points toward a general framework of network centrality as statistical inference to design rigorous graph analytics for statistical problems in networks. 2007-2012 IEEE.",2018,2018-01-01,11,Ieee Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,approximation algorithm; approximation algorithms; cascading failure; cascading failures; economic and social effects; electric fault currents; graph theory; graph theory and algorithms; large-scale stochastic optimization; message passing; message passing algorithm; message-passing algorithms; network centralities; network centrality; optimization; set theory; stochastic optimizations; stochastic systems; vaccines; viral spreading,"Yu, P.-D.

With international concern about the GBR’s declining ecological health, this paper identifies and focuses on implementation failure (primarily at catchment scale) as a systemic risk within the overall GBR governance system. There has been limited integrated analysis of the full suite of governance subdomains that often envelop defined policies, programs and delivery activities that influence water quality in the GBR. We consider how the implementation of separate purpose-specific policies and programs at catchment scale operate against well-known, robust design concepts for integrated catchment governance. We find design concerns within ten important governance subdomains that operate within GBR catchments. At a whole-of-GBR scale, we find a weak policy focus on strengthening these delivery-oriented subdomains and on effort integration across these subdomains within catchments. These governance problems when combined may contribute to failure in the implementation of major national, state and local government policies focused on improving water quality in the GBR, a lesson relevant to landscapes globally. 2017, Springer Science Business Media, LLC.",2018,2018-01-01,7,Environmental Management,agricultural land; agricultural landscapes; agriculture; australia; basin management; catchment; catchment management; catchment scale; catchments; chemistry; conservation of natural resources; coral reef; coral reefs; coral sea; decision making; ecological health; ecosystem health; environmental policy; environmental protection; forest; forest floor; forests; governance approach; governance systems; government; government regulation; great barrier reef; health risks; implementation failure; implementation process; integrated analysis; landscape; legislation and jurisprudence; local government; multi party decision makings; organization and management; procedures; public policy; queensland; reefs; river; rivers; runoff; standards; trends; water quality,"Dale, A.P.

"Lockley, A.; Coffman, D.",Carbon dioxide removal and tradeable put options at scale,"Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy (call options) or sell (put options) a given underlying asset at a particular price at a future date. The purchaser of a put option may exercise the right to sell the asset to the issuer at any point in the future before the expiration of the contract. These rights may be contracted directly between two parties (i.e. over-the-counter), or may be sold publicly on formal exchanges, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange. If the latter, they are called tradeable put options (TPOs) because they can be bought and sold by third-parties via a secondary market. The World Bank has a Pilot Auction Facility for methane and carbon mediation which uses TPOs in carbon-relevant markets, giving producers (of e.g. forest restoration) a floor price for their product . This enables long-term producer planning. We discuss the potentially broader use of these options contracts in carbon dioxide removal (CDR) markets generally and at scale. We conclude that they can, if priced correctly, encourage rapid investment both in CDR technology and in operational capacity. TPOs could do this without creating the same type of systemic risk associated with other instruments (e.g. long-dated futures). Nevertheless, the widespread use of such instruments potentially creates novel risks. These include the political risk of premature closure (conventionally rendered as 'counting your chickens before they are hatched') and the economic risk of overpaying for carbon removal services. These instruments require careful structuring, and do not inoculate the CDR market against regulatory disruption, or political pressure. Accordingly, we note the potential for the development of TPO markets in CDR, but we urge caution in respect of identified risks. 2018 The Author(s).

"Li, L.; Ma, M.; Song, V.","Client importance, bank risk, and systemic risk","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of audit client importance on future bank risk and systemic risk in US-listed commercial banks. Design methodology approach: The authors use archival research method. Findings: The authors mainly find that client importance is negatively related with future bank-specific crash risk and distress risk, and also with sector-wide systemic crash risk and systemic distress risk in the future. The authors also report some evidence that these relations become more pronounced during the crisis period than during the non-crisis period. Moreover, the effect of client importance on systemic risk is found to strengthen in banks audited by Big-N auditors, by auditors without clients who restate earnings, and by auditors with more industry expertise. Research limitations implications: These findings contribute to the auditing and systemic risk literature. Practical implications: This study has implications for regulating the banking industry. Originality value: This study provides original evidence on how client importance affects bank-specific risk and systemic risk of the banking industry. 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,2018-01-01,2,Asian Review of Accounting,audit quality; audit quality contagion; client importance; crash risk; distress risk; systemic risk,"Li, L.

"Kley, O.; Klüppelberg, C.; Reinert, G.",Conditional risk measures in a bipartite market structure,"In this paper, we study the effect of network structure between agents and objects on measures for systemic risk. We model the influence of sharing large exogeneous losses to the financial or (re)insurance market by a bipartite graph. Using Pareto-tailed losses and multivariate regular variation, we obtain asymptotic for conditional risk measures based on the Value-at-Risk and the Conditional Tail Expectation. These allow us to assess the influence of an individual institution on the systemic or market risk and vice versa through a collection of conditional risk measures. For large markets, Poisson approximations of the relevant constants are provided. Differences of the conditional risk measures for an underlying homogeneous and inhomogeneous random graph are illustrated by simulations. 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor Francis Group.",2018,2018-01-01,6,Scandinavian Actuarial Journal,bipartite network; conditional risk measures; conditional tail expectation; multivariate regular variation; poisson approximation; systemic risk measures; value-at-risk,"Kley, O.

"Lu, S.; Xu, X.; Wang, H.; Zhao, J.; Wu, Z.",Detecting systemically important platforms in p2p market of china,"Fueled by advances in technology and shifts in generational values, the market of online peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms is growing prosperously in China. While the development of this rapidly-evolving industry has stimulated the financial market where traditional banks could not reach, collapses of well-known platforms due to malpractice, fraud or business failure are raising great concerns about systemic risk, as troubles of systemically important platforms may trigger wide range of failures because of the network of financial exposures among the industry. However, the network of Chinese P2P lending platforms remains unknown. To fill this vital gap, we performed the first complex network analysis of the Chinese P2P lending platforms using empirical platform-level data. The network analysis enables us to detect the systematically important platforms, through the static importance indicators as well as cascading scheme. A further grouping analysis presents the different characteristic of the platform with different importance levels, which in turn proves the network modeling is able to function effectively in detectina the systemic important platforms. 2018 IEEE.",2018,2018-01-01,0,"2018 15th International Conference on Service Systems and Service Management, Icsssm 2018",network modelling; p2p lending; systemic risk,"Lu, S.

We examine how the Fed's presence affected the interbank system's resilience to solvency and liquidity shocks and whether those shocks might have been contagious. The interbank system became more resilient to solvency shocks but less resilient to liquidity shocks as banks sharply reduced their liquid assets after the Fed's founding.

The country-level analyses show that the lead-lag patterns vary considerably in the short and longer run as well as at different frequencies. Nonetheless, the pivotal role of uncertainty tends to strengthen over longer time horizons (at lower frequencies) and in the BVAR framework.

We show that economies of scale are positively related to size and vertical and horizontal integration of FMI providers. Economies of scale are significantly higher in North America than in other regions. When analyzing economies of scope, we show that the efficiency of FMI providers increases with vertical (but not horizontal) integration and with a focus on a narrow range of asset classes.

"Bhattacharjee, B.; Ramanan, T.R.; Shafi, M.; Acharjee, A.",Elucidation of the backbone structure of cross-market dependency network of world market indices: A global threshold filtering approach,"The multi-tiered cross-market dependency structures among capital market worldwide have a highly complex architecture which makes international portfolio management a challenging exercise. The challenge in recent times has been magnified given that the strengths of linkage structures have increased over the past decades. Understanding the complex interdependencies in a temporal scale and identifying the backbone structure in this interdependent system will aid in unearthing the avenues from where diversification benefits may possibly arise. With this in mind, the current study attempts to mathematically formulate the cross-market connectivity into weighted network models and elucidate the backbone structures by deploying a global threshold filtering approach. The present work investigates the dependency structure based on weekly-data series belonging to forty-three global markets. The weighted networks depicting cross-market relationships are filtered and visually inspected to decipher the significant connectivity structures. The study identifies that average cross-market linkage strengths increased during market stress conditions. The study also identified a disjointed set of markets wherein one can direct the investments to cushion oneself from systemic risk impacts. 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all familial cases of IIH examined in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of our medical center between January 2006 and June 2013.Of a total of 520 patients with IIH, 15 had other family members with IIH (from seven different families). The family relation was a mother and daughter in two families, a brother and sister in four families, and an aunt and two first-degree cousins in the seventh family. Symptoms, course of disease, and risk factors were similar among the relatives of all seven families, except for the age at diagnosis, which was different in one family. All of the adult patients of six families were obese (body mass index 25 35 kg m2), and all of the members of the other family were morbidly obese. There was no association between other systemic risk factors and IIH.IIH occurrence within a family is more common than previously believed, and its incidence in families is more common than in the general population.

Intensive research is underway in both academia and central banks to incorporate a more realistic modelling of financial intermediation and a role for macroprudential policy. Given the technical and computational difficulties arising from modelling systemic risk, it may take some time before economists develop new models that allow a comprehensive and integrated approach to the study of the linkages between financial intermediation and the real economy and the role of policies to promote and preserve financial stability. In the meantime, existing models can be used for the analysis of monetary and macroprudential policy and their interaction.

"Köster, H.; Pelster, M.",Financial penalties and banks’ systemic risk,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of financial penalties on the stability of the banking sector. Design methodology approach: A unique database of 671 financial penalties imposed on 68 international listed banks between 2007 and 2014 and a fixed-effects panel data approach were used. Findings: The show that financial penalties increase banks’ systemic risk exposure but do not significantly affect banks’ contribution to systemic risk. Additionally, the link between financial penalties and systemic risk exposure is weaker in regulatory and supervisory systems with more prompt corrective power among national authorities. By contrast, supervisory authorities’ stronger power to declare insolvency and a greater external monitoring culture exacerbate the positive effects of financial penalties on systemic risk exposure. Practical implications: The punishment of misconduct should correct the social harm and prevent future misconduct while ensuring the banking system’s stability. Therefore, authorities should punish misconduct by implementing penalties against the financial institutions at a specific amount that offsets the damages of misconduct but does not threaten systemic stability. Penalties against institutions may be complemented by financial penalties against upper management to induce a more responsible culture in banks. Originality value: This paper is the first to study the effect of financial penalties on the stability of the financial system.

"Brammertz, W.; Mendelowitz, A.I.",From digital currencies to digital finance: the case for a smart financial contract standard,"Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of a cash flow generating standard for individual financial contract level data and the ability to create such a standard. Design methodology approach: The authors analyze the importance for such a standard of software that turns natural language contracts into cash flow generating algorithms a data dictionary that standardizes contract terms and access to variables that represent the state of the world (e.g. market risk, counterparty risk, etc.) that affect contractual obligations. Findings: The ability to realize benefits from the use of such a contract level algorithmic standard depends on the following: making the standard’s software open source fully testing the software to have complete confidence in its accuracy and enabling the software to use of a wide range of models of various sources of risk (market, credit and behavior risk) to support forward-looking analysis. Such a standard would solve the disconnect that exists in financial firms between the representation of financial contracts for transaction processing and analysis. The ACTUS Financial Research Foundation is building, testing and making available such a standard that represents almost all financial contracts extant in markets. Practical implications: The adoption of such a standard would reduce the costs of operations of financial firms, provide the computational infrastructure for more effective regulatory oversight, reduce regulatory reporting costs and improve financial market transparency. It would also enable the assessment of systemic risk by directly quantifying the interconnectedness of firms.

"Donders, P.; Jara, M.; Wagner, R.",How sensitive is corporate debt to swings in commodity prices,"Commodity producing corporations have trillions of dollars in outstanding debt. Thus, the recent fall in commodity prices raised concerns about sustainability and systemic risks. Using a global sample (2003- 2015) we measure how corporate bonds react to the underlying commodity price. On average a 10% change in the commodity moves yields-to-maturity by only 15 basis points. This is just a tenth of the sensitivity of stocks returns. Nonetheless, bond sensitivity to commodities is significantly stronger for smaller, leveraged and less profitable firms. Also for short maturity bonds. The type of commodity price change matters too. Sensitivity to price drops is at least five times stronger than to increases. Transitory price changes matter for shorter maturities and leveraged firms. In contrast, longer maturities react more to permanent commodity variations. When firms use hedging derivatives, bonds are less sensitive to all price variations. Hedging mitigates the amplification of commodity shocks, as in Shiller (2008). In conclusion, while debt finance deteriorated with the commodity bust, it hardly dried-up. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2018,2018-01-01,7,Journal of Financial Stability,commodity; cost of debt; downgrading; fixed-income; stress-tests,"Donders, P.

EducationalIn this article, we aim to review the of the research on the impact of chronic stress on the occurrence, development, and response to periodontal disease treatments and on the pathophysiological mechanisms of periodontal disease. Conclusion: Chronic stress has a negative impact on the occurrence, development, and response to the treatment of periodontal disease via indirect actions on the periodontium. This can result from behavioral changes caused by stress (poor dental hygiene, smoking, etc.) and a direct neuroimmunoendocrinological action related to the consequences (particularly immunological) of the secretion of certain chemicals (e.g., cortisol) induced by the activation of the hypothalamus and the autonomic nervous system in response to stress. These factors necessitate multidisciplinary management (e.g., physician, oral surgeon, and psychologist) of patients to identify subjects with chronic stress and to employ countermeasures to decrease the impact of stress on the periodontium.

"Yalla, S.P.; Bhattacharyya, S.; Jain, K.",Impact of regulatory announcements on systemic risk in the indian telecom sector,"Purpose: Post 1991, given the advent of liberalization and economic reforms, the Indian telecom sector witnessed a remarkable growth in terms of subscriber base and reduced competitive tariff among the service providers. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of regulatory announcements on systemic risk among the Indian telecom firms. Design methodology approach: This study employed a two-step methodology to measure the impact of regulatory announcements on systemic risk. In the first step, CAPM along with the Kalman filter was used to estimate the daily(systemic risk). In the second step, event study methodology was used to assess the impact of regulatory announcements on dailyderived from the first step. Findings: The of this study indicate that regulatory announcements did impact systemic risk among telecom firms. The study also found that regulatory announcements either increased or decreased systemic risk, depending upon the type of regulatory announcements. Further, this study estimated the market-perceived regulatory risk premiums for individual telecom firms. Research limitations implications: The regulatory risk premium was either positive or negative, depending upon the different types of regulatory announcements for the telecom sector firms. Thus, this study contributes to the theory of literature by testing the buffering hypothesis in the context of Indian telecom firms. Practical implications: The study findings will be useful for investors and policy-makers to estimate the regulatory risk premium as and when there is an anticipated regulatory announcement in the Indian telecom sector. Originality value: This is one of the first research studies in exploring regulatory risk among the Indian telecom firms. The research findings indicate that regulatory risk does exist in the telecom firms of India. 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,2018-01-01,6,International Journal of Emerging Markets,india; systemic risk,"Yalla, S.P.

"Janovec, M.",Integrated supervision of the financial market without the UK,"This paper analyses the integration of financial market supervision at international level, particularly focusing on EU law and the actual processes taking place in this area considering Brexit as its part. Current legislative action at EU level has a significant impact on legislation in all member countries of European Union. This paper seeks, among other things, to find the causes of the increasingly ongoing process of integration of financial market supervision and determine whether or not the direction in which the international integration is going is the right one. The of this paper is to determine whether or not the process of integration increases the efficiency of financial market supervision itself and helps to develop the European single market, while simultaneously reducing systemic risk to financial market stability. 2018 by the author.

"Roukny, T.; Battiston, S.; Stiglitz, J.E.",Interconnectedness as a source of uncertainty in systemic risk,"Financial networks have shown to be important in understanding systemic events in credit markets. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of those networks can affect the capacity of regulators to assess the level of systemic risk. We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses. We further quantify the effects of cyclicality, leverage, volatility and correlations. Our are relevant to the current policy discussions on new regulatory framework to deal with systemic events of distress as well as on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure. 2016",2018,2018-01-01,38,Journal of Financial Stability,contagion; financial networks; regulatory framework; systemic risk; uncertainty,"Roukny, T.

"Tunay, N.; Tunay, K.B.; Özataç, N.",International insurance industry and systemic risk,"After the global crises, it is observed that not only the banking sector but also the insurance industry has systemic risk sources. Moreover, there are studies that found that insurance companies are even more risky compared to other financial intermediaries. In regard to this, life and non-life insurance companies and banks’ systemic risk causalities are analysed. Systematic risk measurements and conditional capital inadequacy were used. Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality tests were used to analyse the weekly global data for the years between 2005 and 2015. The main aim of the study is to find out if there is a relation between the systemic risk of life and non-life insurance and commercial banks. However, the of the past studies indicate that the transfer of bank systemic risk has a strong role. The of the study reveal that especially in regard to conditional risk based value where the systemic risks of life and non-life insurance companies and banks have strong causalities.

"Hashem, S.Q.; Abdeljawad, I.",Islamic banks’ resilience to systemic risks: myth or reality-evidence from bangladesh,"This chapter investigates the presence of a difference in the systemic risk level between Islamic and conventional banks in Bangladesh. The authors compare systemic resilience of three types of banks: fully fledged Islamic banks, purely conventional banks (CB), and CB with Islamic windows. The authors use the market-based systemic risk measures of marginal expected shortfall and systemic risk to identify which type is more vulnerable to a systemic event. The authors also use ΔCoVaR to identify which type contributes more to a systemic event. Using a sample of observations on 27 publicly traded banks operating over the 2005 2014 period, the authors find that CB is the least resilient sector to a systemic event, and is the one that has the highest contribution to systemic risk during crisis times. 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,2018-01-01,7,International Finance Review,bangladesh; conventional banks; delta conditional value at risk; islamic banks; marginal expected shortfall; risk vulnerability; systemic risk; systemic risk measures,"Hashem, S.Q.

"Adrian, T.; Boyarchenko, N.",Liquidity policies and systemic risk,"Bank liquidity shortages associated with the growth of wholesale-funded credit intermediation has motivated the implementation of liquidity regulations. We analyze a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which liquidity and capital regulations interact with the supply of risk-free assets. In the model, the endogenously time varying tightness of liquidity and capital constraints generates intermediaries’ leverage cycle, influencing the pricing of risk and the level of risk in the economy. Our analysis focuses on liquidity policies’ implications for households’ welfare. Within the context of our model, liquidity requirements are preferable to capital requirements, as tightening liquidity requirements lowers the likelihood of systemic distress without impairing consumption growth. In addition, we find that intermediate ranges of risk-free asset supply achieve higher welfare. 2017 International Monetary Fund and Elsevier Inc.",2018,2018-01-01,20,Journal of Financial Intermediation,dsge; financial intermediation; liquidity regulation; systemic risk,"Adrian, T.

The scale of these challenges depends heavily on the outcome of EU-UK negotiations. The European Systemic Risk Board plays a critical role in macroprudential supervision, a crucial policy challenge for the EU. However, there are doubts as to whether it will fulfill its mandate. The EU27 faces major problems in terms of prudential supervision after Brexit since a very large part of their wholesale banking markets are in the UK and thus will not be regulated by the EU after 29 March 2019.

"Van, L.R.",Making innovation more competitive: the case of fintech,"Finance startups are offering automated advice, touchless payments, and other products that could bring great societal benefits, including lower prices and expanded access to credit. Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the United States lags in consumer financial technology. This Article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators. Competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. No agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition. Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""Too Big to Fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in Google, Facebook, and Amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation. 2018 American Statistical Association.

"Su, E.; Wong, K.W.",Measuring bank downside systemic risk in taiwan,"In this study, both systemic and individual bank risks across domestic and international banks in Taiwan are analyzed given a risk event breakout, using the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) and the conditional expected shortfall (CoES) by estimating the bivariate quantile autoregression with asymmetric downside risk adjustment to the daily stock returns of banks. The estimation reveal the significant external asymmetric downside risk in individual bank systemic risk in contrast to the internal asymmetric downside risk in system itself. The individual bank systemic risk contribution is idiosyncratic and incoherent, but the system risk impact on banks is consistent and co-integrated toward all banks. The empirical show that the larger size or leverage of the individual banks causes higher system risk impact, as they are hit and go down jointly in shocking events. The foreign banks incur and spread more symmetric external risk, whereas the domestic banks suffer and release more asymmetric external risk. Accordingly, the banks in North America and Europe not only take system risk but contribute the most systemic risk during the subprime crisis and Greek debt crisis, respectively, leading to the episode of asymmetric volatility externality effect on the Taiwanese banks in Asia. 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",2018,2018-01-01,5,Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,asymmetric downside risk adjustment; bivariate quantile autoregression; covar; systemic risk,"Su, E.

"Zhang, B.; Wang, S.; Wei, Y.; Zhao, X.",Measuring the systemic risk contribution of financial institutes in china based on coes model,"To measure the systemic risk contribution of the financial institutes in China more accurately and to avoid financial risk events, a new method named CoES model is proposed based on the mean value of tail loss. Compared to the traditional CoVaR model, this method pays more attention to the mean value of tail loss than the expected loss on one single quantile, which could provide more accurate information for the supervision when capturing the systemic risk of financial system. The new method is utilized to measure the systemic risk contributions of 21 financial institutions in China from 2007 to 2016. The empirical show that: 1) the CoVaR model may underestimate the systemic risk of financial institutes 2) the banking industry brings the largest systemic risk contribution to the whole financial system, followed by insurance, real estate and diversified financial industry 3) among banking industry, the systemic risk contributions of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China are the largest, which should be the key regulatory objects 4) compared with the banking and real estate industry, the insurance industry and the diversified financial industry own higher VaR value and their systemic risk contributions are relatively lower, so the regulators could pay more attention to their own risk management. 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

The model is based on a dynamic mixture copula. The proposed model captures time-varying nonlinear dependence, which is assumed to be constant in alternative approaches. The time-varying copula parameters are endowed with generalized autoregressive score dynamics. For the institutions of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, several variations of the proposed model are considered and compared with alternative, competing models. It is shown that the proposed model outperforms standard benchmarks and produces reasonable findings regarding the risk contributions of the sectors of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

"Colletaz, G.; Levieuge, G.; Popescu, A.",Monetary policy and long-run systemic risk-taking,"As an extension to the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy, this paper studies the existence of a systemic risk-taking channel (SRTC) in the Eurozone, through an original macroeconomic perspective based on causality measures. Because the SRTC is effective after an incubation periodwe make a distinction between short and long-term causality, following the methodology proposed by Dufour and Taamouti (2010). We find that causality from monetary policy to systemic risk, while not significant in the very short term, robustly represents 75 to 100% of the total dependence between the two variables in the long run. Reverse causality is rejected: systemic risk did not influence the policy of the European Central Bank before the global financial crisis. However, central banks must be aware that a too loose monetary policy stance may be conducive to a build-up of systemic risk. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2018,2018-01-01,21,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,long run causality; monetary policy; srisk; systemic risk-taking,"Colletaz, G.

"Thiemann, M.; Birk, M.; Friedrich, J.",Much ado about nothing macro-prudential ideas and the post-crisis regulation of shadow banking Vielrm um nichts makroprudenzielle ideen und die regulierung von schattenbanken nach der krise,"Post-crisis, macro-prudential ideas have challenged the epistemic authority of private risk management technologies, declaring them to be pro-cyclical contributors to systemic risk. This discursive challenge has been most critical of the shadow banking system, where private risk management instruments are central. This challenge, however, has not been translated into regulatory tools which reflect these convictions. This paper studies this process of discursive challenge to (failed) regulatory intervention for the case of the repo-market, the heart of the current shadow banking system. It traces regulatory efforts on the global and EU level from regulatory statements to (lack of) action, documenting both the persistent articulation of macro-prudential ideas challenging private risk-management systems and timid to no regulatory intervention. It links this hiatus to international coordination problems, the need for macro-prudential action to span regulatory communities, involving banking and financial market authorities and disagreements between micro- and macro-prudentially oriented regulators. The lack of evidence and the difficulty to generate it are identified as major impediments for regulatory consensus, further aggravated by ambiguities about the goals of anti-cyclical regulation. Beyond governance problems and the persistent appeal of private risk-management systems, the paper thus points to difficulties operationalizing macro-prudential ideas as a major explanatory factor. 2018, Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",2018,2018-01-01,12,Kolner Zeitschrift Fur Soziologie Und Sozialpsychologie,epistemic authority; financial regulation; private risk-management; shadow banking,"Thiemann, M.

Furthermore, complexity in modern financial systems has been also an important subject of study. However, we still lack the appropriate metrics to describe such complexity and interconnectedness moreover, the data available in order to describe and study them is still scarce. In addition, most of the focus on the subject of interconnectedness has been on a single type of network: interbank (exposures) networks. We use a comprehensive set of market interactions that include transactions in the securities markets, payment system flows, interbank loans, cross holding of securities, foreign exchange exposures and derivatives exposures. This the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, to describe so comprehensively the complexity and interconnectedness in a banking system. We are able to identify the most important institutions in the whole structure in term of their connectedness, the most relevant layer (in structural terms) of the multiplex and the community structure of the Mexican banking system which can be seen as a generalization of the well-known Core-Periphery model.

Accounts Receivable Financing (ARF) is a type of trade credit that facilitates Korean interfirm transactions. Under ARF, the obligation to reimburse the bank is imputed to the seller if the buyer does not repay the loan to the bank. When the buyer confronts a liquidity shortage and fails to repay the trade credits, unfortunately, the shock is not limited to damage to only the seller because it propagates throughout the interfirm network. The shock is easily propagated because it is highly likely that the seller would also be unable to repay obligations to its own sellers. Since annual interfirm networks follow a scale-free network model, a single liquidity shock triggers a systemic risk. The insolvency of topologically more central buyer firms is shown to pose a higher potential risk to the financial market. In contrast, the firm size is not significantly related to potential risk. Therefore, firms with high centrality should be closely monitored to prevent insolvency crisis and propagation of the liquidity shock in the interfirm network. 2017, Springer Science Business Media New York.",2018,2018-01-01,6,Computational Economics,interfirm network; liquidity shock; systemic risk; trade credit,"Kwon, O.

For both linear and nonlinear return frameworks, assuming normal and heavy-tailed distributions, we identify nonexotic cases in which a change in a bank's systematic risk, idiosyncratic risk, size, or contagiousness increases the risk of the system but lowers the measured SRC of the bank. Assessments based on estimated SRCs could thus produce false interpretations and incentives. We also identify potentially adverse side effects: A change in a bank's risk structure can make the measured SRC of its competitors increase more strongly than its own. Copyright Michael G.

Method: Failure mode and effects analysis was performed incommunity pharmacies in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in October 2016. A 9-member team was assembled, comprising of a leader and process experts who prospectively assessed the medicine dispensing process by brainstorming, quantified the attributed risks, proposed corrective actions, and reassessed the risks.The analysis identified 39 failure modes, out of which the highest criticality scores were assigned to inadequate assessment of therapy appropriateness (Risk Priority Number 45), reluctance to deviate from rebate contracts (36), and dispensing the wrong medicine (30). The corrective actions proposed demonstrated a considerable potential for risk reduction in most failure modes, the most effective of which were introducing obligatory continuous education for pharmacists, organizing communication training, and implementing electronic prescribing.

"Nester, M.L.",Reconciling the volcker rule with the dodd-frank act's objectives: how to best combat systemic risk,"This Note examines the Dodd-Frank Act's ban on proprietary trading and on banks sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds, known as the Volcker Rule. This Rule has been a point of contention since the Act was passed in 2010. Some argue that the ban is either a detriment to bond market liquidity or is unnecessary because a tenuous nexus exists between proprietary trading and true causes of the 2008 financial crisis. Proponents cite the role of proprietary trading in the crisis and the inherent risk that banks accept when engaging in such trading. The controversy surrounding the Volcker Rule has led individuals in politics and finance to discuss whether to amend, or even repeal, the Rule. This Note explores arguments for and against the Volcker Rule and ultimately offers recommendations to amend the Rule while maintaining its (and Dodd-Frank's) venerable goal of curbing systemic risk. First, this Note begins with a discussion of the causes of the financial crisis and systemic risk before explaining the Rule's provisions. This provides the groundwork for the ongoing debate about the Volcker Rule and whether there should be a change in the language of the Rule. Proponents and opponents have clashed on multiple issues, such as whether proprietary trading played a significant role in the financial crisis and whether it actually reduces systemic risk. Understanding arguments on both sides is crucial to assess whether and how the Volcker Rule should be amended in light of systemic risk. This Note concludes that neither outright repeal of the Rule nor leaving it fully intact are appropriate. Rather, this Note offers recommendations to amend it in a way that balances banks' desires to engage in profitable trading with the global interest in curbing systemic risk in the financial system. 2018 Fordham University School of Law.

"Sykes, J.B.",Regulatory reform 10 years after the financial crisis: systemic risk regulation of non-bank financial institutions,"When large, interconnected financial institutions become distressed, policymakers have historically faced a choice between (1) a taxpayer-funded bailout, and (2) the destabilization of the financial system-a dilemma that commentators have labeled the ""too-big-to-fail"" (TBTF) problem. The 2007- 2009 financial crisis highlighted the significance of the TBTF problem. During the crisis, a number of large financial institutions experienced severe distress, and the federal government committed hundreds of billions of dollars in an effort to rescue the financial system. According to some commentators, the crisis underscored the inadequacy of existing prudential regulation of large financial institutions, and of the bankruptcy system for resolving the failure of such institutions. In response to the crisis, Congress passed and President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank) in 2010. Titlesand II of Dodd-Frank are specifically directed at minimizing the systemic risk created by TBTF financial institutions. In order to minimize the risks that large financial institutions will fail, Titleof Dodd- Frank establishes an enhanced prudential regulatory regime for certain large bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. In order to ""resolve"" (i.e., reorganize or liquidate) systemically important financial institutions, Title II establishes a new resolution regime available for such institutions outside of the Bankruptcy Code. The Titleregime applies to (1) all bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, and (2) any non-bank financial companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designates as systemically important. To date, FSOC has designated four non-bank financial companies for enhanced supervision: AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife. However, FSOC has rescinded its designations of AIG and GE Capital as a result of changes to those companies, and MetLife successfully challenged its designation in federal court, leaving Prudential as the sole remaining designee as of the publication of this chapter. Legislation that would repeal FSOC's authority to designate non-banks for enhanced supervision has passed the House of Representatives (H.R. 10), and a bill that would alter FSOC's designation process and standards in more limited ways has also been introduced in the House (H.R. 4061). Title II of Dodd-Frank creates an ""Orderly Liquidation Authority"" (OLA) pursuant to which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) can serve as the receiver for failing financial companies that pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States. The OLA, which was developed as an alternative to the Bankruptcy Code, is similar to the mechanisms the FDIC uses to resolve failed commercial banks. The OLA grants the FDIC broad powers to manage the liquidation or sale of a failed financial company, and Title II includes provisions that offer financial institutions more robust protections against ""runs"" by their derivatives counterparties than they would have under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC, Federal Reserve, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have promulgated a number of rules that have important consequences for the OLA concerning the FDIC's powers as receiver, its general strategy for resolving failed institutions, ""loss-absorbing capacity"" requirements for certain bank holding companies, and derivatives contracts. There have also been a number of proposals to reform Title II. A bill that would (among other things) repeal Title II passed the House in June 2017, and bills to amend the Bankruptcy Code to allow it to deal more effectively with the failure of large financial institutions have been introduced in the House and the Senate (H.R. 10 (115th Cong.), H.R. 1667 (115th Cong.), S. 1840 (114th Cong.)). 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",2018,2018-01-01,0,"Financial Crises and Programs: Developments, Analyses and Research",,"Sykes, J.B.

"Park, D.J.",Remembering financial crises: the risk implications of the rise of institutional investors in project finance,"Barely a decade ago, a cascading sequence of market failures threatened to topple the global financial system. Public responses to the recent Financial Crisis were immediate and drastic to resuscitate the global economy while attempting to make the markets safer. Many financial services sectors have since recovered to pre-crisis levels. One such industry is project finance, which comprises various financing arrangements often used to fund long-term infrastructure or industrial projects. Curiously, significant post-crisis banking regulations and other global credit enhancement initiatives are pushing banks out of project finance and giving rise to institutional investors. This Comment argues that animated institutional activity in project finance may increase both financial and, more notably, governance risks. Further, increased institutional investment in project finance shifts the risk intended to be captured under new banking regulations to unregulated markets and makes the financial system more complex and interconnected. Ultimately, public responses to the Financial Crisis may have the unintended consequence of increasing project-level risks and injecting seemingly regulated systemic risk back into the global financial system. 2018, Michigan Law Review Association.

"Raz, A.F.",Risk and capital in indonesian large banks,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the behavior of banking risk in the emerging economies, particularly Indonesia and contribute to the discussion on the existing policy debate regarding the impact of capital on bank risk. Design methodology approach: This study investigates the relationship between bank risk and capital using data on 15 Indonesian large banks between 2008 and 2015, using z-score and Delta-CoVaR to measure both idiosyncratic and systemic risks. Findings: The empirical investigation suggests that capital has a negative and significant relationship with these risk measures. The authors also find that higher systemic risk encourages banks to increase their capital. However, similar evidence is not found in the idiosyncratic risk models. Finally, the role of capital in reducing risk is considered robust only during the normal periods, as banks may increase their assets risk during times of financial distress. Originality value: Systemic risk (CoVaR) is used to represent bank risk. This study focuses on the Indonesian banking sector (capture institutional arrangements and regulatory environment). It covers the period of 2008 GFC and post-crisis period. 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2018,2018-01-01,8,Journal of Financial Economic Policy,bank; capital; financial markets and institutions; financial risk and risk management; insolvency; systemic risk,"Raz, A.F.

"Sarlin, P.; Giudici, P.; Spelta, A.; Björk, K.-M.",RiskRank to predict systemic banking crises with common exposures,"Systemic risk has remained at the nexus of macro-financial research and policymaking in most parts of the world. Much of the attention has focused on understanding implication of the interconnectedness of financial markets. Instead of focusing only on networks, we use and test the utility of network structures in a novel way. We use RiskRank as a framework to test the use of networks of financial systems, and particularly focus on testing the utility of the network dimension of common exposures (funding composition and portfolio overlap). RiskRank provides an ideal playground for testing the extent to which direct and common exposures perform in capturing transmission of financial crises. The in this paper highlight the importance of common exposures. We show that funding and portfolio composition overlap are significant channels of contagion and should be accounted for when measuring systemic risk. 2018 IEEE Computer Society.

"Viavattene, C.; Jiménez, J.A.; Ferreira, O.; Priest, S.; Owen, D.; McCall, R.",Selecting coastal hotspots to storm impacts at the regional scale: a coastal risk assessment framework,"Managing coastal risk at the regional scale requires a prioritization of resources along the shoreline. A transparent and rigorous risk assessment should inform managers and stakeholders in their choices. This requires advances in modelling assessment (e.g., consideration of source and pathway conditions to define the probability of occurrence, nonlinear dynamics of the physical processes, better recognition of systemic impacts and non-economic losses) and open-source tools facilitating stakeholders' engagement in the process. This paper discusses how the Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) has been developed as part of the Resilience Increasing Strategies for Coasts Toolkit (RISC-KIT). The framework provides two levels of analysis. A coastal index approach is first recommended to narrow down the risk analysis to a reduced number of sectors which are subsequently geographically grouped into potential hotspots. For the second level of analysis an integrated modelling approach improves the regional risk assessment of the identified hotspots by increasing the spatial resolution of the hazard modelling by using innovative process-based multi-hazard models, by including generic vulnerability indicators in the impact assessment, and by calculating regional systemic impact indicators. A multi-criteria analysis of these indicators is performed to rank the hotspots and support the stakeholders in their selection. The CRAF has been applied and validated on ten European case studies with only small deviation to areas already recognised as high risk. The flexibility of the framework is essential to adapt the assessment to the specific region characteristics. The involvement of stakeholders is crucial not only to select the hotpots and validate thebut also to support the collection of information and the valuation of assets at risk. As such, the CRAF permits a comprehensive and systemic risk analysis of the regional coast in order to identify and to select higher risk areas. Yet efforts still need to be amplified in the data collection process, in particular for socio-economic and environmental impacts. 2017 The Authors",2018,2018-01-01,47,Coastal Engineering,coastal zone management; economic and social effects; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; hazard assessment; hazards; integrated modelling approach; losses; multi criteria analysis; multi-criteria analysis; multicriteria analysis; network function virtualization; open systems; probability of occurrence; regional assessment; regional planning; regional risk assessment; response approach; risk analysis; risk assessment; risk management; risks; socioeconomic impact; stakeholder; storm; systemic impact; vulnerability; vulnerability indicators,"Viavattene, C.

However, local processes in the artery wall are becoming increasingly recognized to exacerbate atherosclerosis both in mice and humans. We show that arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) glucose metabolism markedly synergizes with metabolic syndrome in accelerating atherosclerosis progression, using a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mouse model. SMCs in proximity to atherosclerotic lesions express increased levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Cytokines, such as TNF-α produced by lesioned arteries, promote GLUT1 expression in SMCs, which in turn increases expression of the chemokine CCL2 through increased glycolysis and the polyol pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of GLUT1 in SMCs, but not in myeloid cells, accelerates development of larger, more advanced lesions in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, which also exhibits elevated levels of circulating Ly6Chi monocytes expressing the CCL2 receptor CCR2. Accordingly, monocyte tracing experiments demonstrate that targeted SMC GLUT1 overexpression promotes Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment to lesions. Strikingly, SMC-targeted GLUT1 overexpression fails to accelerate atherosclerosis in mice that do not exhibit the metabolic syndrome phenotype or monocytosis. These reveal a potentially novel mechanism whereby arterial smooth muscle glucose metabolism synergizes with metabolic syndrome to accelerate monocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis progression.",2018,2018-01-01,12,Jci Insight,atherosclerosis; glucose metabolism; vascular biology,"Wall, V.Z.

"Reyers, B.; Folke, C.; Moore, M.-L.; Biggs, R.; Galaz, V.",Social-ecological systems insights for navigating the dynamics of the anthropocene,"Social-ecological systems (SES) research offers new theory and evidence to transform sustainable development to better contend with the challenges of the Anthropocene. Four insights from contemporary SES literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c) systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene. 2018 by Annual Reviews.

"Ghulam, Y.; Doering, J.",Spillover effects among financial institutions within germany and the united kingdom,"The recent financial crisis has shown that the relatively new interconnectedness of different types of institutions leads to a transmission of risk between them, therefore increasing systemic risk. This study investigates whether and to what extent financial institutions in Germany and the United Kingdom are exposed to risk transmission. To achieve this, a state-dependent sensitivity value at risk approach is chosen. The empirical estimates suggest that hedge funds are the predominant source of risk spillovers, both in Germany and the UK, while they themselves receive very little risk spillovers. For the United Kingdom, it is shown that the magnitude of risk transmission is similar to that observed for Germany. However, UK insurance firms are less prone to spillovers from the hedge fund industry, but more affected by risks transmitted from banks, indicating possible implications for policy making. Overall, the increase in risk spillovers in volatile times is striking and suggests adapting future regulation to account for this phenomenon. 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2018,2018-01-01,11,Research in International Business and Finance,financial institutions; hedge funds; quantile regression; risk spillovers; state-dependent sensitivity value at risk,"Ghulam, Y.

We develop a novel measure of bank interconnectedness using syndicated corporate loan portfolios, overlap based on industry and region, and different weights such as equal weights, size and relationships. We find that interconnectedness is driven mainly by bank diversification, less by bank size or overall loan market size. Interconnectedness is positively correlated with different bank-level systemic risk measures including SRISK, DIP and CoVaR, and such a positive correlation mainly arises from an elevated effect of interconnectedness on systemic risk during recessions.

"Engle, R.",Systemic risk 10 years later,"Ten years ago, the financial crisis spurred research focused on systemic risk. This article examines the history and application of the SRISK measure, which was developed at that time and is now widely used in monitoring systemic risk around the globe. The concept is explained and a variety of ways to measure SRISK are developed. In this article, new are presented on the uncertainty associated with the SRISK measure and on how it compares with other related measures from both academics and regulators. By focusing on the mechanism by which undercapitalization of the financial sector initiates a financial crisis, new research examines how the probability of a financial crisis is affected by the level of SRISK and, consequently, how much SRISK a country can stand without having a high probability of crisis. The model used to evaluate this probability recognizes the externalities between financial institutions that make an undercapitalized firm or country more fragile if other firms and countries are also undercapitalized.

"Said, F.F.",Systemic risk analysis of global banking systems: basel III regulatory constraint,"This article is particularly concentrated on measuring systemic risk based on network topology of bilateral exposures and obligations specifically for the global banking systems in 2013. Financial network models based on financial exposures are models that aim to depict causal chains of exposures and obligations of counterparties for financial institutions. The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) introduces Basel III regulatory constraint for stabilizing the banking institutions due to the shortcomings of Basel II and the failure of banking institutions during the recent financial crisis in 2007. We analyse the exposure of bank risk under Basel III regulatory constraints. Under Basel III, banks have to meet the capital requirements effective in 2013 (4.5% for the common equity ratio, 6% for the Tiercapital ratio). Our analysis is the bilateral claims of the ultimate risk of the banking systems of the 13 reporting countries that consist of Austria, Netherland, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The sample consists of banks from Central and Eastern Europe with large share of FX exposures on the balance sheet. Empirical findings indicate that systemic risk is dependent on the currency choice of financial institutions. While FX positions denominating in EUR and USD do not pose systemic risk concerns, FX positions denominating in exotic currencies like CHF significantly enhance the banks’ systemic importance. The negative influence of CHF positions might be reduced through prudent corporate governance mechanisms, tight restrictions on banking activity, and more restrictive limits on foreign currency lending in the home countries of the bank holding companies.

"Gómez, F.; Ponce, J.",Systemic risk and insurance regulation,"This paper provides a rationale for the macro-prudential regulation of insurance companies, where capital requirements increase in their contribution to systemic risk. In the absence of systemic risk, the formal model in this paper predicts that optimal regulation may be implemented by capital regulation (similar to that observed in practice, e.g., Solvency II) and by actuarially fair technical reserve. However, these instruments are not sufficient when insurance companies are exposed to systemic risk: prudential regulation should also add a systemic component to capital requirements that is non-decreasing in the firm’s exposure to systemic risk. Implementing the optimal policy implies separating insurance firms into two categories according to their exposure to systemic risk: those with relatively low exposure should be eligible for bailouts, while those with high exposure should not benefit from public support if a systemic event occurs. 2018 by the authors.

"Lin, E.M.H.; Sun, E.W.; Yu, M.-T.","Systemic risk, financial markets, and performance of financial institutions","This paper studies the exposure and contribution of financial institutions to systemic risks in financial markets. We employ three popular indicators of a financial institution’s exposure to systemic risks: the systemic risk index (SRISK) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) of Brownlees and Engle (Volatility, correlation and tails for systemic risk measurement, Social Science Research Network, Rochester, NY, 2012) and the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We use a primary database of Taiwan financial institutions for our empirical study. A panel contains data of stock market returns and balance sheets of 31 Taiwan financial institutions for 2005 2014. We focus on systemic risk analysis so as to understand the dynamics of volatility, interdependency, and risk during the recent financial crisis. We then report the time series dynamics and cross sectional rankings of these systemic risk measures. The main indicate that although these three measures differ in their definition of the contributions to systemic risk, all are quite similar in identifying systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Moreover, we find empirical evidence that systemic risk contributions are closely related to certain institution characteristic factors. The of the Granger causality tests prove that a systemic risk measure is a great alternative tool for monitoring early warning signals of distress in the real economy. 2016, Springer Science Business Media New York.",2018,2018-01-01,60,Annals of Operations Research,covar; financial crisis; mes; srisk; systemic risk,"Lin, E.M.H.

"Asimit, A.V.; Li, J.",Systemic risk: an asymptotic evaluation,"Systemic risk (SR) has been shown to play an important role in explaining the financial turmoils in the last several decades and understanding this source of risk has been a particular interest amongst academics, practitioners and regulators. The precise mathematical formulation of SR is still scrutinised, but the main purpose is to evaluate the financial distress of a system as a result of the failure of one component of the financial system in question. Many of the mathematical definitions of SR are based on evaluating expectations in extreme regions and therefore, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) represents the key ingredient in producing valuable estimates of SR and even its decomposition per individual components of the entire system. Without doubt, the prescribed dependence model amongst the system components has a major impact over our asymptotic approximations. Thus, this paper considers various well-known dependence models in the EVT literature that allow us to generate SR estimates. Our findings reveal that SR has a significant impact under asymptotic dependence, while weak tail dependence, known as asymptotic independence, produces an insignificant loss over the regulatory capital.

"Huang, W.-Q.; Uryasev, S.",The cocvar approach: systemic risk contribution measurement,"Systemic risk is the risk that the defaults of one or more institutions trigger a collapse of the entire financial system. In this paper, we propose a measure for systemic risk, CoCVaR, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the financial system conditional on an institution being in financial distress. This measure is similar to Adrian and Brunnermeier’s CoVaR from 2008, but we change the systemic risk from VaR to CVaR. This measure considers severe losses of the financial system beyond VaR. CoCVaR is estimated using CVaR (superquantile) regression. We define the systemic risk contribution of an institution as the difference between CoCVaR conditional on the institution being under distress and the CoCVaR in the median state of the institution. We estimate the systemic risk contributions of the ten largest publicly traded banks in the United States for a sample period February 2000 to January 2015 and compare CoCVaR and CoVaR risk contributions for this period.

We use both the equity and credit default swap (CDS) market responses to the announcement. Our suggest that the capital markets perceive the Volcker Rule as a positive regulatory measure overall. Using our own proxy, we examine market reactions to banks targeted and not targeted by the Volcker Rule and find that the overall positive market response to the Volcker Rule appears to be driven by the larger number of non-targeted, smaller banks. We conclude that the Volcker Rule has a positive effect on smaller banks in that it levels the playing field between large and small banks. Further analyses indicate that banks with higher systemic risk, less liquidity, and worse financial reporting quality are more likely to be negatively impacted by the Volcker Rule. The analyses of these characteristics before and after the announcement of the rule also indicate a positive impact of the Volcker Rule. 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2018,2018-01-01,2,Journal of Economics and Business,financial crisis; liquidity; systemic risk; volcker rule,"Elayan, F.A.

This statistic measures how closely the economy's markets are coupled. The more closely financial markets are coupled the more susceptible they are to systemic collapse. A new alternative measure of financial market health, the implied information processing ratio or entropic efficiency of the economy, was derived using concepts from information theory. This new entropic measure can also be useful in predicting economic downturns and measuring systematic risk. In the current work, the relationship between these two ratios and types of risks are explored.

"Busch, D.; van, R.M.B.J.",Towards single supervision and resolution of systemically important non-bank financial institutions in the european union,"The global financial crisis proved that banks are not the sole source of systemic risk to the financial system and the wider economy. Indeed, systemic risk emanating from non-bank financial institutions proved to be a key vulnerability of the financial system. Such risks occurred, above all, when leveraged non-bank financial institutions performed bank-like activities such as maturity and or liquidity transformation. However, the increasingly blurred distinction between markets, financial institutions, services and products is not matched in the European Union by an integrated regulatory and supervisory approach. Instead, regulation was and remains largely organised along sectoral lines, with an emphasis on the banking sector. As the global financial crisis shows, this creates a risk of gaps in the coverage of regulation and supervision, leading to inconsistent regulatory treatment of equivalent products and or services. This in turn causes an unlevel playing field and increases the potential for regulatory arbitrage. In consequence, risky activities migrate to less regulated or unregulated parts of the financial system, leading to a largely unchecked build-up of systemic risk. Drawing inspiration from the reforms in the United States, we propose that the EU’s system of financial regulation be complemented by a robust body charged with identifying and monitoring non-bank financial institutions that are systemically important. This EU authority should have the discretion to designate a non-bank financial institution as a Non-Bank Systemically Important Financial Institution (non-bank SIFI). A logical choice would be to confer such powers on the European Systemic Risk Board. Designated non-bank SIFIs should be placed under direct prudential supervision by an EU body. This EU supervisor would have to establish, on an individual or categorical basis, appropriate enhanced prudential requirements tailored to the nature, risks and activities of the relevant non-bank SIFI. Additionally, a single European resolution regime should be in place to ensure that non-bank SIFIs can fail without destabilising the financial system. This would avoid a possible Too-Big-To-Fail’ status, remove implicit government guarantees and subject the institution to market discipline. Our proposal aims to ensure that non-bank SIFIs are brought within a regulatory perimeter and supervisory scrutiny consistent with the risk they pose to financial stability. Such a regime would (i) help to eliminate (national) supervisory and regulatory gaps, (ii) reduce regulatory arbitrage activities, and (iii) contribute to the stability of the financial system and a level playing field. 2018, The Author(s).",2018,2018-01-01,6,European Business Organization Law Review,cross-sectoral; non-bank sifis; regulation; regulatory arbitrage; resolution; supervision; systemic risk; systemically important financial institutions,"Busch, D.

"Poce, G.; Cimini, G.; Gabrielli, A.; Zaccaria, A.; Baldacci, G.; Polito, M.; Rizzo, M.; Sabatini, S.",What do central counterparty default funds really cover A network-based stress test answer,"In recent years, an increased effort has been made to further the development of effective stress tests that can be used to quantify the resilience of financial institutions. Here, we propose a stress test methodology for central counterparties (CCPs) based on a network characterization of clearing members (CMs) that takes into account the propagation and amplification of financial distress through the network of bilateral exposures between CMs. We apply the proposed framework to the fixed-income asset class of Cassa di CompensazioneGaranzia (CC G), the CCP operating in Italy, whose cleared securities are mainly Italian government bonds. We consider two different scenarios where exogenous losses may be incurred: a distributed initial shock and a shock corresponding with the coverregulatory requirement (entailing the simultaneous default of the two most exposed CMs). Network effects turn out to substantially increase the vulnerability of the CMs in both scenarios, though distress propagation is much more rapid in the latter case, where we note a large number of early triggered additional defaults. This shows that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies on a coverbasis alone may not be adequate for the taming of systemic events. Overall, our network-based stress test methodology represents a refined tool for calibrating conservative default fund amounts. Infopro Digital Limited 2018.
