103-677-731-097-66X,A Systemic Risk Indicator for Leveraged Finance Exposure in the Banking System,,2022.0,conference proceedings article,6th FEB International Scientific Conference 2022,,University of Maribor Press,,Gennaro de Novellis; Paola Musile Tanzi; Elena Stanghellini,"<jats:p>In recent years, the context of the banking system,characterised by expansive monetary policies, has boosted the investments in leveraged loans. The COVID-19 pandemic brought the first real slowdown of the global economy since the financial crisis of 2007-08, and the growth of the leveraged loan market has been subject to significant attention from the competent authorities. Banks have remained solid despite the adverse outlook, however, the banking landscape continues to be impacted by the uncertainty relating to the evolution of the pandemic. The original sample for this paper, made up of leveraged loans, combines instrument-specific information with information on financial borrowing and the composition of the syndicate of banks/lenders. The aim of the paper is to identify a systemic risk indicator that takes into account the concentration of credit risk within each bank. For this purpose, using an Mquantile regression, it is possible to obtain an indicator (Mquantile coefficient) for each bank that varies between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate the greater presence of risky leveraged loans in that specific bank. Combined with an indicator of loan sharing between banks, this also allows a graphical representation of the network of banks in this specific market.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18690/um.epf.5.2022.19,,10.18690/um.epf.5.2022.19,,,0,,0,False,,,lens
074-628-298-689-013,Systemic risk analytics: A data-driven multi-agent financial network (MAFN) approach,2013-08-30,2013.0,journal article,Journal of Banking Regulation,17456452; 17502071,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United States,Sheri M Markose,"Systemic risk from financial intermediaries (FIs) refers to a negative externality problem, which is rife with fallacy of composition-type errors. To ‘see’ why seemingly rational behaviour at the level of an individual FI contributes to system-wide instability is a non-trivial exercise, which requires holistic visualization and modelling techniques. Paradox of volatility inherent to market price-based measures of systemic risk has made bilateral balance sheet and off balance data between FIs and network analysis essential for systemic risk management. There is both a data and a skills gap in implementing large-scale data-driven multi-agent financial network models that can operationalize macro-prudential policy. Different designs for a Pigou-type systemic risk surcharge are discussed with special reference to the Markose eigen-pair method, which simultaneously determines the degree of instability of the network of financial flows of obligors and also the rank order in the centrality of FIs contributing to it.",14,3,285,305,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Balance sheet; Corporate governance; Financial risk management; Centrality; Financial intermediary; Analytics,,,,,http://www.acefinmod.com/docs/BigDataandsystemicriskanalyticsSubmittedFinal17May%20Sheri%20MarkoseJBR.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Fjbr.2013.10 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jbr.2013.10/fulltext.html https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jbkreg/v14y2013i3p285-305.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fjbr.2013.10.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:pal:jbkreg:v:14:y:2013:i:3:p:285-305 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/12248/ https://core.ac.uk/display/74371187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/jbr.2013.10,,10.1057/jbr.2013.10,2109534397,,0,000-916-126-057-046; 001-355-306-290-901; 001-540-558-635-35X; 003-803-424-332-155; 003-820-584-591-441; 005-551-128-069-895; 009-498-142-516-298; 013-118-111-585-482; 013-203-804-862-59X; 014-744-329-084-394; 015-060-513-258-680; 016-404-762-876-829; 017-421-298-700-053; 018-249-138-257-990; 019-687-296-589-620; 020-699-158-967-631; 021-795-063-162-773; 022-251-860-277-646; 022-609-226-545-432; 024-828-296-919-906; 026-028-860-458-627; 032-726-822-328-27X; 033-254-404-268-36X; 040-254-949-205-098; 040-993-307-018-29X; 041-145-303-622-646; 041-957-605-127-468; 042-387-243-987-771; 043-098-145-788-803; 043-796-302-997-51X; 044-013-598-133-78X; 044-469-580-444-50X; 045-621-917-355-01X; 046-702-361-910-006; 051-834-170-778-597; 052-466-504-607-57X; 052-619-799-818-546; 054-293-409-557-957; 056-278-363-680-032; 057-009-805-315-309; 057-229-969-248-039; 058-009-348-224-124; 058-504-344-679-015; 059-934-099-107-836; 059-977-711-279-010; 060-198-985-993-214; 061-047-185-991-841; 062-287-556-567-476; 062-665-995-202-765; 064-453-283-762-981; 065-120-565-419-066; 066-044-456-127-763; 066-740-154-957-592; 071-093-734-097-384; 073-700-878-638-164; 074-849-208-298-983; 075-897-862-903-52X; 076-110-534-820-623; 078-350-232-946-138; 082-993-387-956-350; 087-531-693-607-218; 089-450-601-061-368; 091-697-140-316-685; 093-153-420-490-239; 094-536-533-871-972; 101-754-013-906-702; 104-103-219-632-911; 105-606-479-170-427; 106-871-893-307-939; 110-977-968-678-874; 118-740-565-396-384; 122-398-653-590-957; 123-184-204-550-362; 124-234-879-244-688; 124-548-275-720-331; 132-233-546-905-789; 132-260-384-475-272; 133-207-616-913-993; 138-091-537-508-762; 138-488-531-828-883; 139-025-166-443-808; 139-252-933-035-806; 142-631-391-157-152; 142-899-965-580-740; 147-055-809-833-920; 147-347-703-593-281; 149-072-355-976-691; 149-503-486-528-348; 150-724-220-992-957; 155-330-219-797-433; 165-953-013-282-470; 169-145-562-046-390; 170-056-544-686-862; 171-330-967-937-139; 173-725-380-373-900; 176-144-577-800-05X; 177-663-500-742-403; 179-771-902-584-867; 181-815-727-769-293; 182-391-029-544-353; 184-605-626-502-307; 185-921-089-685-072; 186-677-543-910-482; 187-044-216-430-496; 189-360-627-444-099; 192-182-712-951-086; 194-621-551-579-846; 197-722-239-417-254; 198-131-103-449-267,22,True,,green,lens

Methods Patients with diagnosis of CSCR, either acute or chronic, were included in this multicentric, retrospective study. Demographic factors; systemic risk factors; central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), linear extent of ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone damage on optical coherence tomography; details of leak on fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography were included as predictors of anatomical and visual outcomes.

Galán; Javier Mencia,"The credit-to-GDP gap, as proposed by the Basel methodology, is the reference measure for the activation of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer. However, most of the countries implementing this instrument in recent years are not following its signals due to the large downward biases that it is presenting after the last financial crisis that do not reflect properly the current macrofinancial environment. In this context, credit gap measures that incorporate economic fundamentals may provide more accurate signals of cyclical systemic risk. We propose two alternative model-based indicators that account for these factors. We assess their performance using time series data from the 1970s for six European countries and compare them to the Basel gap. We find that our proposed models provide more accurate early warning signals of the build-up of cyclical systemic risk than the Basel gap, as well as lower biases after rapid changes in fundamentals. Furthermore, we identify the model specifications that are optimal for each of the countries considered. Our flexible approach can easily accommodate national specificities, which are key to maximize the performance of the models.",61,6,1,33,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Time series; Economics; Financial crisis; Context (language use); Warning system; Identification (information); Capital (economics),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprempeco/v_3a61_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a6_3ad_3a10.1007_5fs00181-020-01993-2.htm https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-020-01993-2 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/empeco/v61y2021i6d10.1007_s00181-020-01993-2.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprempeco/v_3a61_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a6_3ad_3a10.1007_5fs00181-020-01993-2.htm,,,3120760552,,0,004-444-967-570-541; 007-360-564-323-635; 007-922-150-573-775; 008-271-655-709-260; 009-436-952-432-180; 010-082-183-376-582; 010-473-221-502-403; 011-744-340-434-210; 016-239-106-990-387; 017-197-286-656-813; 017-249-810-343-672; 020-622-703-622-466; 022-169-339-890-463; 031-726-702-699-723; 035-179-259-308-526; 040-993-307-018-29X; 041-134-028-440-982; 041-494-609-613-756; 046-593-658-166-492; 048-783-262-860-269; 050-912-665-267-70X; 051-989-441-161-692; 059-690-364-621-644; 060-313-041-029-808; 062-396-880-208-961; 067-743-826-495-651; 068-892-590-192-069; 070-122-665-911-904; 079-107-305-724-672; 080-703-207-411-302; 083-597-989-491-775; 085-077-323-603-826; 097-352-194-138-508; 109-708-527-768-283; 118-072-486-463-795; 121-547-438-018-122; 131-235-307-528-886; 140-192-503-616-065; 142-788-921-824-932; 165-504-542-003-189; 168-564-855-529-222; 171-512-376-915-971; 174-209-802-111-587; 179-874-430-704-147; 186-820-919-296-214; 190-910-933-234-507; 196-433-555-608-637,1,False,,,lens

To provide a rigorous econometrics foundation for empirical CDS analysis, this paper applies the augmented Dickey–Fuller, Phillips–Perron, Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin, and Ng–Perron tests to study the unit root property of CDS spreads, and it uses the Phillips–Ouliaris–Hansen tests to determine whether they are cointegrated. The empirical sample consists of daily CDS spreads of the six large U.S. banks from 2001 to 2018. The main findings are that it is log, not raw, CDS spreads that are unit root processes, and that log CDS spreads are cointegrated. These findings imply that, even though the risks of individual banks may deviate from each other in the short run, there is a long-run relation that ties them together. As these CDS spreads are an important input for financial systemic risk, there are at least two policy implications. First, in monitoring systemic risk, policymakers should focus on long-run trends rather than short-run fluctuations of CDS spreads. Second, in controlling systemic risk, policy measures that reduce the long-run risks of individual banks, such as stress testing and capital buffers, are helpful in mitigating overall systemic risk.",7,3,90,,Systemic risk; Cointegration; Econometrics; Economics; Unit root; Short run; Default risk; Bank credit; Credit default swap; Sample (statistics),,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/7/3/90 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jrisks/v7y2019i3p90-d260881.html https://doaj.org/article/3ccd25c2d7c3401ab81ad532618c377e https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/7/3/90/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks7030090,,10.3390/risks7030090,2969412785,,0,007-107-230-254-597; 007-583-920-783-098; 008-903-086-764-907; 017-326-143-243-825; 017-486-496-247-162; 019-036-413-941-920; 027-434-050-672-955; 029-781-914-688-700; 043-030-888-629-28X; 048-580-836-133-280; 052-619-799-818-546; 054-466-892-952-211; 064-983-128-387-606; 078-670-984-804-40X; 097-729-028-047-464; 110-291-282-386-563; 117-903-132-807-368; 125-676-391-281-527; 160-209-962-869-700; 164-307-698-336-407,3,True,cc-by,gold,lens

In the over-the-counter (OTC) world of complex assets containing subprime debt, however, everybody besides the dealers seems to be the losers. OTC instruments offer dealers far better profits than exchange-traded contracts, but at a cost in terms of inferior price discovery, a lack of liquidity support from other dealers, and little or no secondary market support for buy side investors. The use of illiquid and opaque OTC instruments not only was an important factor in the failures of Long Term Capital Management, Amaranth Advisers, and Bear Stearns, but also threatened the stability of other firms and in general caused substantial market volatility, both for OTC markets and the traditional exchanges.

042-693-928-751-185,Three Essays on the Political Economy of Corporate Bailouts,,,,,,,,Michael G. Smith,"Three Essays on the Political Economy of Corporate Bailouts Michael Graham Smith This dissertation is comprised of three papers exploring the causes of the likelihood and distribution of corporate bailouts. The first paper explores why some distressed firms receive bailouts while others do not. It argues that political partisanship plays a key role: left-wing governments are more likely to authorize bailouts on average, and are particularly more likely to save employee-rich firms. The theory is tested using a new dataset comprised of financially distressed firms, a subset of which receive bailouts. The second paper examines why bailouts are concentrated in a particular subset of industrial sectors. The primary argument is again political partisanship: left-wing governments seek to protect firms in sectors that have the most employees. Alternative explanations, including the impact of globalization and alternative forms of social protection, are also considered. The theory is shown to hold using a new dataset comprised of comprehensive counts of bailouts by sector across the European Economic Area. The final paper examines the nature of public opinion regarding bailouts. The paper undermines the standing assumption that bailouts are largely unpopular by instead showing that public support varies by context and is in some instances supportive. Using observational data in conjunction with survey experiments, individual characteristics, including partisanship and material self-interest, as well as firmspecific characteristics, including the relevance of the firm to the national economy, are shown to drive public support for bailouts. Chapter 1: Who Gets a Lifeline? The Political Economy of Corporate Bailouts Why do some governments provide some firms that face bankruptcy a bailout while allowing others to fail? Despite the notoriety of bailouts in the aftermath of the Great Recession, their continuing occurrence in the still-unfolding Eurozone crisis, and an enduring public debate about their virtues, little systematic theory or evidence exists to explain the variation in their use. I develop three explanations of bailout provision grounded in the literature: one that focusses on the systemic risk posed by the failure of large financial firms, another that examines the conditions under which policymakers are most likely to acquiesce to demands made by the special interests that are directly harmed by the failure of the firm, and a third that highlights the role of the partisan orientation of policymakers in impacting the likelihood of a bailout being given as well as the kinds of firms that receive bailouts. To test these three explanations, I construct a new dataset of 631 financially distressed firms, a portion of which receive bailouts, that are located in 50 countries are operate in a wide array of industries by means of media keyword searches. I find evidence in support of the systemic risk and partisanship explanations of bailout provision. Larger firms and firms operating in the financial sector are shown to be more likely to receive bailouts. Further, left-wing governments are 11.5 percentage points more likely to provide a bailout than other kinds of governments, and their positive impact on bailouts is increasing in the number of employees in a firm. Chapter 2: Picking Winners by Saving Losers: Partisanship and the Sectoral Allocation of Corporate Bailouts Why do firms operating in some industries receive more bailouts than those operating in others? I argue that the partisanship of elected officials plays a critical but overlooked role in the distribution of corporate bailouts across economic sectors. Out of concern for the livelihood of their core electoral constituency, labor, left-wing governments are hypothesized as seeking to prevent the bankruptcy of firms operating in employee-rich sectors through the issuance of bailouts. Right-wing governments instead seek to shield capital from the costs associated with bankruptcy by issuing more bailouts to firms operating in sectors of the economy that are capital intense. To test these hypotheses, I construct a new comprehensive dataset of bailout counts by sector-year across the European Economic Area, 1999-2011. While left-wing governments are shown to provide relatively labor-intensive sectors with 1.6 times as many bailouts as do non-left-wing governments, right-wing governments as shown to provide relatively capital-intensive sectors 2.5 times as many bailouts as do non-rightwing governments. Further, alternative explanations of the sectoral distribution of bailouts, including the dislocation caused by global integration and the presence of other forms of social protection, are not supported by the data. The results enrich our understanding of which industries governments favor with targeted forms of protection, and why. Chapter 3: Predicting Public Support for Corporate Bailouts To what extent does the public support corporate bailouts, and why? Existing analyses of the causes and distribution of corporate bailouts assume that, as a transfer to a narrow group of recipient-firm beneficiaries, bailouts are vastly unpopular with the public. This paper instead finds across a number of American and German surveys that public opposition is by no means universal. Further, ideologically liberal voters, as well as those with a material stake in the fate of the distressed firm, are shown to be more supportive of bailouts. Using two new survey experiments, the paper also finds that bailouts that minimize economic dislocation at the national level are more popular than those with a regional scope. Surprisingly, respondents express no greater sympathy for firms with many employees. The results suggest that the politics of bailouts may be populist in some cases, and that re-election seeking politicians would be wise to take their constituents’ opinions in to account when weighing whether or not to save a distressed firm.",,,,,Political economy; Systemic risk; Economic sector; Political science; Social protection; Bailout; Public debate; International political economy; European debt crisis; Bankruptcy,,,,,https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:176138/CONTENT/Smith_columbia_0054D_12128.pdf https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8QZ283M,http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/d8qz283m,,10.7916/d8qz283m,81951489,,0,000-135-070-651-529; 000-651-285-581-426; 004-103-733-854-845; 004-363-258-188-37X; 004-871-543-401-169; 005-774-319-011-328; 006-249-317-301-226; 007-073-255-253-723; 007-204-711-429-751; 007-319-603-950-208; 008-998-590-834-024; 009-946-174-337-012; 010-688-924-277-001; 010-973-190-271-876; 011-535-311-863-365; 011-550-305-990-339; 011-821-862-779-722; 012-856-043-047-436; 017-481-349-273-755; 019-387-957-666-204; 021-338-591-258-046; 022-621-892-426-584; 023-553-614-751-461; 023-596-016-492-826; 024-813-983-826-750; 025-707-652-488-352; 025-801-277-418-635; 027-195-759-230-470; 027-218-886-517-473; 027-572-769-880-056; 028-626-642-851-909; 030-097-046-778-291; 030-278-618-418-789; 032-016-026-840-268; 034-594-658-621-79X; 034-782-635-694-396; 042-288-659-411-051; 042-646-831-692-99X; 044-580-375-533-998; 047-515-212-112-505; 047-522-460-385-217; 047-838-205-281-008; 047-992-557-420-505; 048-046-256-893-646; 049-550-906-034-27X; 050-030-659-887-705; 051-020-610-227-404; 051-138-259-192-307; 052-379-698-983-008; 052-751-417-012-845; 053-071-772-804-887; 053-323-692-638-768; 053-659-957-455-991; 053-812-861-168-46X; 054-337-387-411-915; 054-368-148-072-436; 057-045-302-923-589; 059-813-202-916-56X; 061-481-507-039-91X; 062-113-629-675-356; 063-773-607-028-094; 065-517-883-345-141; 065-554-505-206-93X; 066-276-557-052-548; 068-527-009-607-748; 069-607-748-804-864; 069-803-621-029-82X; 071-439-087-220-117; 072-751-306-332-315; 073-810-049-237-694; 073-883-113-579-515; 074-081-877-930-67X; 075-631-451-469-679; 075-951-366-783-957; 076-122-409-919-702; 084-564-866-505-060; 085-110-982-720-876; 085-971-573-734-390; 086-116-534-070-199; 086-154-779-962-440; 086-810-731-652-737; 086-825-334-503-254; 087-140-420-993-282; 096-108-678-033-517; 097-316-186-618-124; 098-464-807-759-191; 099-593-127-821-673; 100-204-224-295-662; 100-347-468-685-999; 100-682-628-255-92X; 101-198-531-708-488; 101-429-002-848-421; 102-901-309-420-393; 102-961-034-982-622; 103-015-289-399-08X; 105-138-643-175-373; 105-269-374-105-501; 105-663-919-028-661; 107-760-488-688-189; 108-169-341-991-376; 111-727-111-304-042; 112-038-255-035-120; 113-835-181-126-457; 114-274-633-759-642; 114-610-364-953-083; 114-963-841-258-23X; 116-802-878-613-034; 120-674-214-727-697; 122-135-810-237-715; 126-930-391-000-390; 127-132-879-421-279; 127-591-075-733-325; 130-167-093-048-909; 130-214-856-789-633; 130-432-400-302-44X; 130-841-582-368-104; 131-567-656-195-670; 132-527-202-827-100; 133-241-855-207-841; 134-365-476-026-443; 136-148-574-067-160; 137-396-514-389-239; 138-799-427-350-099; 145-244-207-459-02X; 145-922-139-792-17X; 146-498-678-441-287; 147-684-065-453-838; 148-138-459-859-820; 148-549-529-353-929; 151-062-977-630-081; 152-236-364-100-452; 153-802-930-717-36X; 155-467-582-782-479; 156-264-681-585-610; 161-032-848-070-183; 161-244-990-071-341; 163-926-847-617-824; 170-422-690-906-517; 173-043-949-737-572; 173-774-194-561-060; 174-550-438-327-304; 175-016-116-250-582; 175-216-184-374-647; 178-415-554-787-571; 179-316-265-816-834; 181-580-739-484-566; 183-799-020-487-490; 184-679-427-908-250; 184-894-542-882-430; 185-357-946-893-18X,0,False,,,lens

Chan-Lau,"Diebold and Yilmaz (2015) recently introduced variance decomposition networks as tools for quantifying and ranking the systemic risk of individual firms. The nature of these networks and their implied rankings depend on the choice decomposition method. The standard choice is the order invariant generalized forecast error variance decomposition of Pesaran and Shin (1998). The shares of the forecast error variation, however, do not add to unity, making difficult to compare risk ratings and risks contributions at two different points in time. As a solution, this paper suggests using the Lanne-Nyberg (2016) decomposition, which shares the order invariance property. To illustrate the differences between both decomposition methods, I analyzed the global financial system during 2001 – 2016. The analysis shows that different decomposition methods yield substantially different systemic risk and vulnerability rankings. This suggests caution is warranted when using rankings and risk contributions for guiding financial regulation and economic policy.",,,,,Decomposition method (constraint satisfaction); Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economic forecasting; Order (exchange); Invariant (physics); Ranking; Mathematics; Decomposition (computer science); Variance decomposition of forecast errors,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/imfimfwpa/17_2f107.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/imfimfwpa/17_2f107.htm,,,3122248924,,0,,2,False,,,lens

We analyze this model from a game-theoretic point of view. Every firm is a rational agent in a directed graph that has an incentive to allocate payments in order to clear as much of its debt as possible. Each edge is weighted and describes a liability between the firms. We consider several variants of the game that differ in the permissible payment strategies. We study the existence and computational complexity of pure Nash and strong equilibria, and we provide bounds on the (strong) prices of anarchy and stability for a natural notion of social welfare. Our results highlight the power of financial regulation -- if payments of insolvent firms can be centrally assigned, a socially optimal strong equilibrium can be found in polynomial time. In contrast, worst-case strong equilibria can be a factor of $\Omega(n)$ away from optimal, and, in general, computing a best response is an NP-hard problem. For less permissible sets of strategies, we show that pure equilibria might not exist, and deciding their existence as well as computing them if they exist constitute NP-hard problems.",,,,,Debt; Systemic risk; Economics; Microeconomics; Order (exchange); Financial market; Financial networks; Rational agent; Best response; Financial regulation,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1908.01714.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1908.01714,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1908.01714.html,,,3124963375,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Kenny; Madeleine Puig; Ricardo Salinas; Daniel A. Johnson; Ahmad Kheirkhah,"OBJECTIVE To report the ocular and systemic risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management outcomes of Moraxella keratitis. METHODS This retrospective study included patients with culture-proven Moraxella keratitis in South Texas between 2012 and 2018. Clinical data including demographics, ocular and systemic risk factors, clinical presentation, speciation, and treatment course were collected. RESULTS Fourteen eyes of 14 patients had culture-proven Moraxella keratitis which made up 8.1% of cases of culture-proven bacterial keratitis in the period studied. These included 10 men and 4 women with a mean age of 52.7±11.3 years. Ten patients (71.4%) had different ocular risk factors such as ocular trauma, corneal foreign body, contact lens use, preceding viral keratitis, neurotrophic cornea, and recent corneal transplant on topical steroids. Systemic risk factors included diabetes mellitus, systemic immunosuppressive therapy, cancer chemotherapy, and AIDS. There was no specific clinical manifestation. The size of stromal infiltration on initial presentation varied among the cases, with 71.4% stromal infiltrations of 4 mm or less. The patients were managed with fortified tobramycin, fortified vancomycin, and moxifloxacin eye drops. No eyes required surgical intervention during treatment for the active infection, except for one eye with pre-existing no light perception that was enucleated because of chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS Moraxella keratitis is a less frequent form of bacterial keratitis that appears more prevalent in patients with previous ocular conditions.

At the same time, the adverse effects of global environmental change such as global warming, extreme events, and outbreaks of pandemics significantly hinder island economies&amp;amp;#8217; progress towards sustainability, and consistently rank them high on various vulnerability indices. This talk introduces the concept of&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;socio-metabolic risk&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, defined as systemic risk associated with the availability of critical resources, the integrity of material circulation, and the (in)equitable distribution of derived products and societal services in a socio-ecological system. Drawing on years of socio-metabolic research on islands, I will argue that specific configurations and combinations of material stocks and flows and their &amp;amp;#8216;resistance to change&amp;amp;#8217; contribute to the system&amp;amp;#8217;s proliferation of socio-metabolic risk (SMR). For better or for worse, these influence the system&amp;amp;#8217;s ability to consistently and effectively deliver societal services necessary for human survival. Governing SMR would mean governing socio-metabolic flows, and easing resource requirements through &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;green(-blue) infrastructure &amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;and nature-based solutions (NBS) to provide crucial societal services.

J. Welfens,"BREXIT is a historical step for the UK and the EU27 which could bring a strong Pound deprecation, an increase in risk premiums for British bonds and a transitory rise of financial market volatility plus a long-term reduction of economic growth in the UK; but also risks for the EU27. New BREXIT aspects are considered in an enhanced Branson model. Macroprudential supervision is a crucial policy challenge for EU28 in the context of BREXIT and the European Systemic Risk Board thus should have a critical role in 2019 and the following years. The ESRB should timely analyze the potential risk of BREXIT and consider adequate policy options to reduce or eliminate risks. Contract continuity as well as cooperation in prudential supervision between the EU27 and the UK stand for BREXIT-related problems that could create financial market stability – as is the BREXIT-induced UK deregulation pressure. EU prudential supervision post-BREXIT faces problems since a very large part of EU27 wholesale banking markets in the UK and thus not regulated by the EU after March 29, 2019. The EU Commission’s competence for EU trade policy as well as international investment treaties gives the EU the opportunity to offer the UK not only a – limited – Free Trade Agreement but an international investment treaty as well, including options for global cooperation.

The crisis revealed the financial supervisory authorities’ failure, in the run-up to the crisis, to anticipate adverse macroprudential developments and prevent the accumulation of excessive risks within the financial system. This triggered a heightened awareness among regulatory and supervisory authorities regarding stability at a systemic level and macroprudential developments. The creation of the ESRB resonates with other initiatives in the aftermath of the crisis, among them the establishment of the Financial Stability Board (based with Bank for International Settlements in Basel) and, more recently, the conferral of macroprudential powers to the European Central Bank under the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The ESRB is part of the European System of Financial Supervision, the purpose of which is to ensure supervision of the European Union’s financial system. This article begins with a description of the institutional aspects of the ESRB, building on a study of its founding documents and regulation. Special attention is given to the ESRB’s mission and objectives, which are defined as contributing to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks to financial stability within the European Union. An in-depth analysis of the concepts of systemic risk and financial stability is conducted, because these concepts are crucial for determining the reach of the ESRB’s authority and responsibility. In view of the magnitude of the tasks assigned to the ESRB, this chapter considers whether the ESRB in its existing form is well suited for the large and complex undertaking it is expected to perform. This question is addressed with a critical analysis of the ESRB’s applicable measures as well as its governance structure and decision-making processes. There is reason to believe that organisational improvements will be necessary to obtain the envisaged effectiveness.

This paper contributes to the process by exploring the economics of equity and mezzanine tranche retention in the context of systemic risk, moral hazard, accounting frictions and funding distortions. It shows that loan screening activity is maximized when the loan originating bank retains the equity tranche. However, in case capital structure irrelevance does not hold a profit maximizing bank is likely to favor retention of the less risky mezzanine tranche. From a regulator's perspective this is a problem because the implied loan screening activity is substantially lower in this case.

065-306-613-582-243,The predictive content of financial cycle measures for output fluctuations,,2011.0,,,,,,Tim Ng,"The financial cycle refers to fluctuations in perceptions and attitudes about financial risk over time. It is often marked by swings in credit growth, asset prices, terms of access to external funding, and other financial developments. A single measure that summarised such indicators would simplify analysis of the financial cycle, with benefits for both systemic risk assessment and stabilisation policy. It is not obvious, however, how best to select and combine the many potentially relevant indicators or how the usefulness of the resulting measure might be assessed. One criterion is predictive power. This special feature reviews the power of three differently composed measures to predict output fluctuations up to two years ahead. One of the measures is found to have substantial predictive content for output forecasting at short horizons. However, this result seems to arise mainly from the inclusion of indicators strongly related to actual financial system stress, rather than from swings in more generalised perceptions and attitudes about financial risk.",,,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Asset (economics); Perception; Predictive power; Single measure; Financial risk,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/bisbisqtr/1106g.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/bis/bisqtr/1106g.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/bisbisqtr/1106g.htm,,,3124008460,,0,,33,False,,,lens
066-234-582-128-094,Impact of context on food safety management systems in fresh produce chains,,2015.0,,,,,,K.K. Kirezieva,"SUMMARY Background and aim This research was a part of a project of the European Commission called VEG-i-TRADE, aimed at identifying possible impacts of climate change and globalisation on safety of fresh produce. VEG-i-TRADE formed a multidisciplinary team of scientists from different disciplines, representatives from the food industry and other stakeholders from the European Union and third party countries. The objective of this research was to investigate the influence of context on status of food safety management systems (FSMS) in the fresh produce chain. Under context, we aimed to study the broad context in which companies operate, including food safety policy, supply chain, and climate that may directly and indirectly influence the actual set-up and operation of FSMS. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach was employed to link concepts from different fields, and to provide scientific evidence about the possible role of the systems in the broad context in setting and operating FSMS in companies. The scientific challenge was to employ an interdisciplinary approach and bridge the gap between disciplines such as food technology, quality management, political economy, and supply chain management. The approach that was used could also be defined as transdisciplinary, as it was problem-oriented and involved companies, sector organisations and academia, thus, relating stakeholders/problem owners and scientists. Findings Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis describe the development of a diagnostic tool to assess the status of FSMS and riskiness of their company specific context. The tool allows assessment of the FSMS activities, FSMS output and context factors that affect decision-making in the FSMS (so called, FSMS context). The latter include product, production, organisation, and chain characteristics. The tool allows assessment that is independent from implemented legislation, guidelines, or standards. Moreover, the tool provides for mapping of FSMS and their context over supply chains, different countries, and sectors. The diagnostic tool was applied in three case studies of leafy greens production regions in Belgium, Norway, and Spain (chapter 4). Moreover, a theoretical framework was developed to explore the broad context in which companies operate. The latter was defined as including the sub-systems of: food safety governance, agro-climatic, market and public policy environments. The companies operating in favourable broad context, including favourable climate, big companies in integrated market, and stringent standards as a result of market self-regulation, have demonstrated advanced FSMS, good information about the output and supporting organisational characteristics. The FSMS of the companies that were operating in less favourable broad context, either in fragmented market with small companies or in less favourable climate, have demonstrated less mature FSMS. As a conclusion, we postulate that the FSMS output is a function of the broad context in a country and sector, the FSMS context in a company, and implemented food safety management system. Market and supply chain governance were further investigated in chapter 5, with a special focus on cooperatives. Case studies were performed in four cooperatives, with different supply chain governance of transactions. Results suggested that high vertical integration has a positive influence on FSMS. However, when cooperatives become too large and complex, horizontal collaboration decreases and may negatively influence FSMS. Chapter 6 dove into the factors determining differences between companies operating under the European Union laws, and companies in emerging and developing countries exporting to the EU. Data analysis revealed that the main factor that was determining the differences between companies was not their location, but the availability of information, expertise, and collaboration within the supply chain, which was linked to the increased integration of supply chains triggered by the stringent requirements of private standards. Another important factor was linked to the support by sector organisations and NGOs for small and medium companies, in cases when supply chains are less integrated and only national standards or GlobalGAP are followed. The companies with lowest scores of their FSMS were linked to lack of support in supply chain or country, and no standards or guidelines implemented. These companies were only small ones located in developing and emerging countries. The pressures of climate change on safety management in fresh produce farms were explored in a Delphi study (chapter 7). The experts were from countries in the global North - with industrialized food systems, and in the global South - with structured and traditional food systems. The identified pressures were linked to contamination of water resources and production environment with microorganisms, pesticide residues, mycotoxins and heavy metals. Response strategies were defined for each pressure, including coping strategies immediately after a pressure occurs, and adaptation strategies to increase adaptive capacity. The insights from the study revealed that a first response to climate change will be realised by the FSMS activities implemented in companies. The experts stressed the need to strengthen some of the activities, and validate their effectiveness for the changed circumstances. Likelihood of the most pressures was assessed as higher for the countries from the global south, which was explained by existing adaptations in the global north. It was proposed that the adaptive and coping capacities of companies, regions and sectors are determined by the currently available adaptation and coping strategies. The role of the broad context for the food safety management research and practice is discussed in chapter 8. It is highlighted that systemic risks can occur at the junction between different social, political and natural systems, and they need to be taken into account in the overall food safety governance. Systems thinking approaches are advocated to explain the relationships between systems and their synergic effects. Conclusions The research described in this thesis demonstrated that FSMS are influenced not only by the narrow FSMS context of a company, with its product, production, organisation, and chain, but also by the broad context in a country and sector. The broad context involves the agro-climatic, market and public policy environments that can affect the overall food safety governance. Food safety governance includes different public, private or hybrid organisations aimed at enforcing standards and guidelines into companies’ specific FSMS. Market and particularly supply chain integration play an important role for capacity building and maturation of the FSMS. The highest degrees of integration are driven by private interests imposed by private (brand) standards, and result in advanced FSMS. Baseline standards putting minimum requirements from a public health perspective result in basic FSMS, not adapted, and tested for own production circumstances. Vertical integration in the supply chain is particularly important in developing and emerging economies, where institutional environments are sometimes weaker – struggling with the set-up and enforcement of legislation, lacking produce, and sector organisations to support farmers. In developed economies in the European Union, cooperatives play an important role to support farmers. However, their vertical expansion may have negative impact on FSMS possibly related to loss of social capital and members’ motivation. Last but not least, FSMS need to continuously evolve and adapt to new pressures like the ones triggered by climate change.

In this regulatory space jurisdictional borders are elusive. Especially the United States and the European Union are applying what seems to be a novel type of regulatory strategy designed to protect their market share and curb regulatory arbitrage. The strategy, dubbed here the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, builds on unilateralist application of extraterritoriality, forms of direct and indirect protectionism, and conditional deference. Deference strategies such as the US substituted compliance and the EU equivalence regime should be regarded as carrots, applied together with the sticks of extraterritoriality and protectionism to drive regulatory convergence towards the strongest. However, the EU and US have failed to fill the leadership void in the global financial governance system, which remains soft at its core, and instead locked themselves in a regulatory turf war which has prevented them from recognising each other's regulatory frameworks or finalising their own. Meanwhile, looming risks of costly regulatory retaliation are increasing market fragmentation and deglobalisation. The emerging ""titanic model"" of systemic risk management, where risk is concentrated in presumably watertight national compartments rather than mutualised globally, is not the way towards a more stable global financial system. In the short term, a successful completion of the transatlantic partnership is needed in order to reach the derivative reform's ultimate goals and to counter financial fragmentation. But acknowledging the many practical and political problems involved in the exportation of rules through the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, which can also be manifested in a bilateral form, this paper joins the increasing number of scholars calling for more global and multilateral forms of financial governance.",2016,01,,,Public economics; Systemic risk; International trade; Economics; Global governance; Global financial system; Deference; European union; Corporate governance; Financial regulation; Derivatives market,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2733138 https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/regulate-thy-neighbour-competition-and-conflict-in-the-cross-bord https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/39022 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2733138_code2171964.pdf?abstractid=2733138&mirid=1 https://core.ac.uk/display/45686469 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/45686469.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2733138,,10.2139/ssrn.2733138,2286193325,,0,023-466-453-124-444; 036-886-762-310-999; 081-257-399-195-884; 086-917-271-737-819; 115-906-362-911-137; 150-515-194-070-762,0,True,,green,lens

Methodology- Our empirical study aims to measure the systemic risk of the Tunisian banking system over the period going from 2008 to 2015. Our study period is marked by the 2011 Tunisian revolution and goes from June 2008 to December 2015. Our research sample consists of the eleven Tunisian listed banks on the Tunisian stock exchange. We calculate monthly bank returns that are calculated as the arithmetic mean of the daily data of the month. We use daily closing pricing data of the eleven listed banks and the stock market index TUNINDEX from 2 January 2008 to 31 December 2015. The variable to explain: Tunindex: the benchmark index of the Tunis Stock Exchange. It is composed of the country's fifty largest capitalizations. It allows an assessment of the market trend. The explanatory variables are the returns of the eleven banks listed on the Tunisian stock exchange. For the measurement of Covar, we approach the bank risk by its historical volatility based on the GARCH (1.1) model developed by Belerselv (1986). We then sum quarterly bank Covars to obtain the Covar of the whole banking system and integrate it into a model, to test empirically the relationship between the calculated ""CoVaR and the future unemployment rate in Tunisia during the post-revolution period (2011 – 2014). We apply the OLS least squares and corrected least squares method. To check for the robustness of obtained results, we then adopt the ""VAR"" called the Autoregressive Vector (Sims, 1980), which highlights interdependencies between several time series. Findings- Results show that ATTIJARI BANK is the largest contributor to the TUNINDEX systemic risk before revolution, while BT is the least influent one. Private banks rankings are reversed during post revolution period, against public banks which maintained their ranks. Globally, many private banks that floundered at the bottom of the rankings before revolution rank very high during the following period. Moreover, the top 5 of Tunisian systemic banks after revolution is composed of two public banks and three private ones. Public banks are risky because of the bad governance they suffer due to state intervention. Regards to the most systemic private banks (BT, BIAT et ATB), they seem to be the biggest on the financial place and with the highest performances and outstanding’s loans to the economy. Finally, the regressions’ results show that the future unemployment rate depends only on the preceding one and not on the systemic risk index (COVAR). Conclusion- Finally, our research aims to add a broader perspective to establish and ensure compliance with good governance principles within public banks, particularly in terms of independence. Moreover, it encourages for the strengthening of the large private bank prudential supervision, the latters being considered as the most efficient and the most active on markets. Also, our research should be completed by a study of bank’s systemic risk determinants in order to better control et prevent any slippages",12,1,80,81,Systemic risk; Economics; Stock exchange; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Market trend; Good governance; Corporate governance; Financial system; Stock market index; Volatility (finance),,,,,https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/pap/issue/59366/851875 https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/1482472,http://dx.doi.org/10.17261/pressacademia.2020.1356,,10.17261/pressacademia.2020.1356,3114034545,,0,,0,True,,gold,lens

This paper critically reviews the extensive EWS literature and typology and proposes a new class of supervisory models. The paper also discusses important design implications for an efficient EWS. The new class of supervisory models for systemic risk should be built from an integrated perspective and model EWS according to the users' objectives and competencies. It should incorporate both microprudential and macroprudential perspectives, as well as the structural considerations of the financial system itself. From the financial supervisor's point of view, an EWS involves an ex ante approach to regulation designed to highlight conditions that have in the past been associated with systemic risk. Forward-looking supervisory instruments become more important as they allow ex ante policy action and can reduce the need for ex post regulation.",5,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Ex-ante; Business; Systemic risk; Action (philosophy); Supervisor; Warning system; Publication; Typology; Scopus,,,,,https://businessperspectives.org/index.php/journals/banks-and-bank-systems/issue-2-cont-10/early-warning-systems-for-systemic-banking-risk-critical-review-and-modeling-implications,https://businessperspectives.org/index.php/journals/banks-and-bank-systems/issue-2-cont-10/early-warning-systems-for-systemic-banking-risk-critical-review-and-modeling-implications,,,3123667538,,0,,10,True,cc-by,gold,lens

This has resulted in a call from the scientific community to adopt a systemic risk perspective on drought. However, a thorough understanding of how drought risks manifest, cascade and interact across different systems and sectors is still lacking, and methodological guidance on how to analyse and represent these interdependencies does not yet exist.&amp;amp;#160; In order to explore these gaps, we have developed conceptual models of drought risks for key selected systems and sectors in the European Union.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For each system and sector considered (rain fed and irrigated agricultural systems, forest ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems, public water supply, inland water transport and the energy sector), a conceptual model was constructed to depict how drivers and root causes interact to create drought risk. The models are based on the impact chains methodology and are informed by literature review and multiple expert consultations (including a series of validation workshops). Subsequently, the system-specific models were used to build an overarching conceptual model of the critical interdependencies that exist between all the systems and sectors considered.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The analysis has revealed that, in each system, drought risks manifest through a complex web of interactions between drivers of risk, which are in part system-specific and in part shared across the systems considered. From this, multiple considerations for drought risk assessment and management can be derived. In particular, special attention should be placed in defining and representing what drought risk is in each system, as the underlying characteristics might greatly differ. Additionally, the use of conceptual models can constitute an important first step for risk assessment, as they contribute to addressing the complexity of drought risks. Finally, the existence of commonalities and interdependencies between systems implies that interventions can and must be designed so as to consider multiple systems at once, thus avoiding maladaptive solutions. In this sense, the conceptual models can serve as entry points for the identification of risk reduction and adaptation measures which go beyond the single-risk and single-sector perspective, thus contributing to a more systemic view on drought risk management and adaptation, as well as highlighting persisting knowledge gaps.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>",,,,,Interdependence; Systemic risk; Vulnerability (computing); Environmental resource management; Conceptual model; Business; Conceptual framework; Agriculture; Perspective (graphical); Environmental science; Economics; Computer science; Ecology; Political science; Biology; Sociology; Social science; Financial crisis; Computer security; Database; Artificial intelligence; Law; Macroeconomics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu23-7991,,10.5194/egusphere-egu23-7991,,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Using correlations, cross-autocorrelations, principal components analysis, regime-switching models, and Granger causality tests, we find that all four sectors have become highly interrelated and less liquid over the past decade, increasing the level of systemic risk in the finance and insurance industries. These measures can also identify and quantify financial crisis periods. Our results suggest that while hedge funds can provide early indications of market dislocation, their contributions to systemic risk may not be as significant as those of banks, insurance companies, and brokers who take on risks more appropriate for hedge funds.",,,,,Granger causality; Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Hedge fund; Financial crisis; Market return; Financial system; Interconnectedness,,,,,,,,,3167393309,,0,000-203-627-584-442; 000-252-304-760-510; 001-355-306-290-901; 001-366-989-490-42X; 002-221-006-006-473; 003-668-886-029-995; 003-723-398-637-640; 006-278-536-295-850; 006-659-120-939-252; 007-512-146-614-819; 007-950-273-735-509; 009-379-393-726-466; 009-671-785-817-816; 011-151-941-222-906; 011-229-931-508-350; 012-213-689-424-270; 013-206-942-213-532; 013-803-144-182-159; 014-417-591-158-960; 015-210-448-626-803; 015-981-370-324-666; 016-231-703-521-654; 017-486-496-247-162; 017-794-695-634-717; 020-370-965-175-522; 021-758-199-224-256; 021-813-650-201-251; 022-879-860-770-354; 025-984-821-082-018; 027-353-945-524-684; 028-268-662-634-496; 030-352-937-146-744; 030-687-893-898-067; 032-441-975-325-943; 034-330-953-548-063; 034-499-445-341-086; 035-104-934-704-682; 037-545-964-020-544; 038-080-443-203-467; 038-475-110-639-314; 039-664-791-595-538; 040-801-336-012-314; 042-000-219-862-339; 042-300-326-395-662; 042-301-632-077-050; 043-709-660-453-83X; 045-320-906-901-370; 045-859-637-738-024; 046-352-365-586-832; 048-960-309-118-972; 051-095-045-935-892; 053-189-908-917-324; 053-992-943-857-702; 054-574-447-562-897; 059-156-374-169-903; 059-211-131-089-289; 061-187-520-305-47X; 061-677-181-504-029; 062-412-251-485-832; 068-485-258-963-185; 070-251-441-596-141; 071-180-041-011-002; 074-520-132-119-470; 074-849-208-298-983; 081-264-294-612-376; 081-474-615-941-986; 086-771-766-095-679; 088-352-504-423-819; 088-670-290-046-803; 089-308-393-175-805; 090-019-206-727-665; 093-207-179-038-828; 094-698-172-286-234; 098-476-237-359-353; 100-446-896-445-856; 100-910-802-848-846; 101-058-395-846-549; 101-703-894-064-954; 103-246-920-086-906; 113-453-102-798-199; 115-912-228-451-249; 119-165-772-598-331; 119-686-438-725-263; 121-241-815-329-11X; 123-699-515-895-205; 126-518-315-474-602; 126-676-245-830-280; 129-478-976-930-228; 130-267-475-113-68X; 132-989-213-554-255; 134-548-354-615-84X; 138-870-072-568-417; 142-357-234-903-255; 149-035-303-281-895; 149-152-423-036-758; 151-026-253-897-292; 155-330-219-797-433; 158-257-523-418-339; 170-056-544-686-862; 171-066-812-689-775; 174-705-688-250-665; 183-376-861-980-736; 194-495-895-867-839; 196-524-401-795-883; 197-046-338-419-203; 198-229-842-695-766,0,False,,,lens

In the financial system, there are some banking-type financial institutions that have a pivotal position due to their large scale and other reasons and have a greater influence on systemic financial risks, so the identification and supervision of such financial institutions are very important. In China, banks occupy an important position among various financial institutions, and the main content of this paper is to identify the systemically important banks in China. In the research process, we refer to international disclosures and previous studies to determine the assessment models for different types of banks, then substitute the data of selected institutions to derive their systemic importance scores, select the threshold values to identify systemically important banks, explain the assessment results, and finally propose policy recommendations based on the assessment results.KeywordsSystemically important banksIndicator methodEntropy method",,,367,378,Systemic risk; China; Position (finance); Financial crisis; Business; Identification (biology); Financial system; Scale (ratio); Finance; Economics; Political science; Geography; Botany; Cartography; Biology; Law; Macroeconomics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-6755-9_29,,10.1007/978-981-19-6755-9_29,,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The Financial Times Stock Exchange survey notes that frontier markets exist in more than 150 countries. The sum of systemic risk in the frontier markets can hinder economic stability in terms of a herd of risk. Frontier markets are likely to imply unpredicted systemic risk if we think based on previous lessons learned from being unable to foresee the early signals of the Lehman Brothers shock. The reasons for the rarely studied systemic risk in these markets might be that the markets are systemically unimportant, and there is a lack of publicly available data access. Therefore, I gave it my best shot to capture systemic risk in the frontier market entirely using financial statement data. It is sometimes said that the frontier market is systemically not important because of its small size; however, the research argued that the interconnection between financial institutions is highly likely to raise systemic risk even if it is small. The fact is the majority of financial institutions in developed, emerging, and frontier markets are deeply interconnected with each other via a network. For instance, the financial market in Mongolia is representative of frontier markets. As a financial regulatory aspect, financial conglomerates are increasing and deepening their interconnection in bank-dominated and underdeveloped capital markets. Hence, the intuition is to capture the systemic uncertainty behind increasing conspiracies in financial conglomerates to negatively impact financial stability. To accomplish this, the methodology measures financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk can be computed by the systemic expected shortfall. The systemic expected shortfall would be dependent on the marginal expected shortfall and can be explained by financial leverage and liabilities as the predicting power increases. Moreover, financial statements are situational mirrors of financial institutions. Based on these assumptions, we empirically measured the time and cross-dimensions of systemic risk using financial statement data. Potential variables from financial statements were tested to identify variables that could forecast systemic risk. Stock returns and capital market data have been frequently experimented with in previous literature, and financial statement data of frontier markets are new for systemic risk measurement. As a result of the analysis, the systemic expected shortfall could explain cross-dimension systemic risk, which is financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Subsequently, the time series of the marginal expected shortfall can forecast the amount of systemic risk in the next two periods. Eventually, macroprudential policy, a policy tool for systemic risk, can be easily developed after forecasting financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk.KeywordsSystemic riskMacroprudential policySystemic expected shortfallMarginal expected shortfallFinancial leverageValue at riskOptimal tax",,,147,180,Systemic risk; Financial market; Frontier; Capital market; Business; Financial system; Emerging markets; Financial risk; Economics; Finance; Financial economics; Financial crisis; Political science; Law; Macroeconomics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-9365-7_4,,10.1007/978-981-19-9365-7_4,,,0,012-525-456-033-239; 017-421-298-700-053; 022-304-930-380-208; 025-599-126-786-346; 044-283-531-051-747; 052-619-799-818-546; 053-194-698-585-347; 097-549-687-680-548; 108-288-033-842-039; 115-806-665-215-624; 124-361-589-313-704; 169-145-562-046-390; 171-044-000-550-412,0,False,,,lens

073-852-413-955-453,The Implications of the Adoption of the EU Acquis on the Romanian Banking Sector,2012-07-01,2012.0,journal article,Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice,19489137; 21622752,Addleton Academic Publishers,United States,Octav Negurita,"ABSTRACT. At present, the current economic reality marks an important moment in the evolution of the Romanian banking system and, in particular, for the process of assimilation of national legislation with the EU. The implementation of measures meant to liberalize the banking services, as required under EU law, may create serious problems for the Romanian banking sector. The recent problems of the banking system in the euro area raise questions opposite to the correctness of the legislative process of liberalization, in the context of bank nationalization processes recorded in several Member States. The future adoption of the euro is thus more risky, since, at the institutional level, the Romanian banking sector is not fully prepared to absorb all the criteria of the EU legislation.Keywords: standardization, risk, system, modification, banks1. IntroductionThe harmonization term is found in subsequent treaties: the Treaty of Rome, for example, in article 51 of the Maastricht Treaty, saying that ""The liberalization of banking and insurance services, which are related to movements of capital, must be achieved by harmonizing with the liberalization of capital movements."" Romania's participation in the Economic and Monetary Union is conditioned by the adoption of the acquis specific to the single market and, in particular, by the acquis' adoption related to free movement of capital, as with all Member States.The harmonization of legislation from Romania with the European banking legislation addresses the issue of uniform legislation in the European banking sector and an analysis of the provisions of the Romanian legal framework in this field. In this context, this process involves extensive changes occurring on the legal status of the central bank in Romania, for integration into the euro-zone, from the duties of the National Bank of Romania, the international relations, management, organization and representation of the National Bank, as well as the exchange of information. It is also targeted the National Bank's monetary policy, the inflation as a monetary policy strategy and the concrete ways of achieving monetary policy.The institutional harmonization of the Romanian banking system involves, last but not least, some legislative changes brought to the regulatory framework for credit institutions, the law applicable to credit unions and to the standardization stage of the legislation in the banking system in Romania. There should not be excluded the legislative framework, with regard to the currency regime, based on the rights of residents and nonresidents, the prior authorization and the currency control, the formal requirements regarding the currency regime.2. Institutional changes at the level of the Community banking systemUp to the introduction of the euro, Romania has to reach a high degree of sustainable convergence to ensure the adoption of that single currency. At present, the contemporary economic realities raise many issues in order to fulfill at least part of the convergence criteria, especially those related to budget deficits, inflation, exchange rate stability and legislative compatibility, making it unsafe to set a date for the introduction of the euro. European Union Council adopted, on 17 November 2010, the legislation establishing the European Systemic Risk Council and the three new financial supervisory authorities, among which the European Banking Authority (EBA). The European Systemic Risk Council (ESRB) will provide a macro-prudential surveillance of the financial system and the creation of three new European authorities that will supervise banks, insurance companies and financial markets, informs the Department for European Affairs (DAE). ""By adopting this legislative package, the EU proposes a set of concrete measures designed to ensure financial stability throughout the Union, to guarantee application of the same basic technical rules and enforce them consistently,"" reads the APR document. …",4,2,567,,Economic policy; Currency; Economics; Economic and monetary union; Maastricht Treaty; National bank; Treaty of Rome; European union; Single market; Financial regulation; Economic system,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3020151531/the-implications-of-the-adoption-of-the-eu-acquis,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3020151531/the-implications-of-the-adoption-of-the-eu-acquis,,,827870462,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has suggested in its guidance to national authorities that the credit-to-GDP gap be used as a guide to taking decisions regarding the countercyclical capital buffer. This paper provides a South African perspective on the implementation of this guidance. Credit-to-GDP gaps are estimated by applying a range of Hodrick-Prescott filters to real-time South African data, specifically constructed for this study, and these gaps are mapped to countercyclical buffers. The properties of these estimates are compared, and the calibration of the lower and upper thresholds of the buffer in the South African case is also investigated. The study confirms that the mechanical application of the credit-to-GDP guide is not advisable, and raises a number of issues that policymakers will have to consider when implementing the countercyclical buffer guidance. The analysis also suggests that the calibration of the lower and upper thresholds for the gaps may need to be adjusted in the South African case if the Basel Committee’s expectation that the buffers be employed only every 10-20 years is to be met.",,,,,Macroeconomics; Systemic risk; Economics; Perspective (graphical); Financial sector; Financial stability; Banking sector; Monetary economics; Capital (economics),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:55368,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:55368,,,1755572218,,0,,3,False,,,lens

Systemic risk is regarded to be an endogenous outcome of interactions by rational agents on imperfect markets. Market imperfections give rise to systemic externalities which cause an excessive level of systemic risk. This creates a scope for welfare-increasing government interventions. Current policy debates usually refer to them as ’macroprudential regulation’. I argue that efforts undertaken in this direction - most notably the incipient implementation of Basel III- are insufficient.

106-867-284-911-16X,Socioeconomic status and modifiable risk factors for osteoporosis and knee osteoarthritis.,,,dissertation,,,,,Sharon Lee Brennan,"Musculoskeletal disease is a major public health burden in developed countries worldwide, with significant attributable morbidity. Two of the most commonly occurring musculoskeletal conditions are osteoporosis and osteoarthritis both leading causes of long-term pain and disability. The significant burden of impact of ; musculoskeletal diseases (osteoporosis and arthritis) on the Australian population was ; recognised in July 2002, when the National Health and Medical Research Council declared musculoskeletal diseases to be the 7th National Health Priority Area. ; Osteoporosis is a disease that is characterised by bone fragility with the common endpoint of fracture, which is associated with an increased likelihood of morbidity in the elderly and a reduction in mobility, ability to self-care and quality of life. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is used as a surrogate marker for osteoporosis. ; Osteoarthritis is a complex disease that most commonly affects the knee joint and is ; the most prevalent single cause of pain and disability in the elderly. Our understanding of the early stages of disease, prior to radiographic disease, has been limited due to the lack of a sensitive, non-invasive tool to assess disease severity and detect small changes in knee structure over time. The recent application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to examination of osteoarthritis enables an assessment of all joint structures, including direct measure of both bone and cartilage, and thus ; offers itself as a promising imaging modality to examine osteoarthritis onset and progression. ; It has been suggested that osteoporosis and osteoarthritis share common modifiable ; risk factors that are associated with socioeconomic status (SES). SES is a construct that considers the level of social disadvantage, and usually measured by income, education, occupation, marital status, or by area-based aggregate scores. Furthermore, individuals of lower SES are less likely to undergo screening for musculoskeletal ; disease. However to date, little is known of the relationship between SES and osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. While these common diseases differ in their presentation, they share potential risk factors and tissue involvement, although how they are related remains contentious. ; ; This thesis aimed to examine current understandings of the association between SES and modifiable risk factors on osteoporosis. Further, this thesis aimed to examine the effect of modifiable and systemic risk factors for osteoarthritis on knee cartilage (defects and volume) and bone, and the significance of their change over time in both healthy/asymptomatic subjects and in those with knee osteoarthritis. ; Overall, fourteen publications are included within the body of this thesis. ; Socioeconomic status and risk factors for osteoporosis and osteoarthritis ; Section 3 presents Socioeconomic status and risk factors for obesity and metabolic disorders in a community based sample of adult females, and Socioeconomic status, obesity and lifestyle in men: the Geelong Osteoporosis Study, which identified a significant inverse association for both genders between SES and risk factors for osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. These include measures of obesity, associated with ; greater prevalence of osteoarthritis, and physical inactivity and smoking; associated with both osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. A letter to the editor Urban-rural comparison of weight status among women and children living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods suggested socioeconomic status as a stronger determinant of obesity than urban or rural locality. ; ; Osteoporosis Socioeconomic status and bone mineral density ; In Section 4.1, a systematic review of existing literature, Association between socioeconomic status and bone mineral density in adults: A systematic review identified consistent, yet limited, evidence for a positive association between educational attainment and BMD in women; however no evidence was found regarding an association between income or occupation and BMD in either gender, or education and BMD in men. Data from a randomly-selected cohort of adult women is presented in BMD in population-based women is associated with socioeconomic status, and showed that at the spine, the maximum difference of 7.5% was observed between SES quintiles. Observed differences in BMD across SES quintiles, consistent for both SES indexes, suggest that low BMD may be evident for both the most disadvantaged, and the most advantaged. Further analysis of BMD in men, presented in Socioeconomic status and bone mineral density in a population-based sample of men: The Geelong Osteoporosis Study identified that in younger men, BMD was ; highest at the spine in the mid quintiles of SES. In older men, the pattern of BMD across SES quintiles was reversed, and subjects from the mid quintiles had the lowest BMD. Differences in BMD at the spine across SES quintiles represent a potential 1.5- fold increase in fracture risk for those with the lowest BMD. ; Socioeconomic status and fracture ; In Section 4.2 The association between socioeconomic status and osteoporotic ; fracture in population based adults: A systematic review, presents strong evidence for an association between being married/living with someone and reduced risk of osteoporotic fractures. Limited evidence existed of the relationship between fracture and occupation type, employment status or for type of residence. Conflicting evidence existed for the relationship between osteoporotic fracture and level of income and education. A published letter to the editor Educational achievement and fracture risk: Response to Clark and Tobias responds to an alternate suggestion for the relationship between SES and fracture. A third systematic review, The association between urban ; or rural locality and hip fracture: A systematic review, identified moderate evidence for residents of rural regions to have lower risk of hip fracture compared to urban residents. Incident hip fracture and social disadvantage in an Australian population aged 50 years or greater presents an examination of hip fracture rates across SES in the Barwon Statistical Division (BSD) for the period of 2006-7 and showed an inverse association between SES and fracture risk in both genders. ; Osteoarthritis Socioeconomic related modifiable factors and knee structure ; Chapter 5 examines osteoarthritis and contains five publications that examine risk factors for knee structure, with a focus on SES related modifiable factors, and the relationship to osteoporosis. Firstly, Section 5.1 examines the association between BMI and knee structure in Does an increase in body mass index over 10 years affect knee structure in a population-based cohort study of adult women? After adjusting for age and bone area, current BMI was associated with cartilage defects, with a trend for ; increased BMI over 10 years associated with reduced cartilage volume. Bone marrow ; lesions were associated with baseline BMI, current BMI, and change in BMI over the ; 10 year study period. This study provides longitudinal evidence for the importance of ; avoiding weight gain in women during early to middle adulthood. Section 5.2 ; examines BMD and knee structure in Bone mineral density is cross-sectionally associated with knee cartilage volume in healthy, asymptomatic adult females: Geelong Osteoporosis Study, and showed a positive association between BMD and ; tibiofemoral cartilage volume. Whilst site-specific BMD is associated with cartilage volume, cartilage defects, thought to represent early OA changes, showed a trend of association with BMD. These data suggest that the association between cartialge volume and axial/lower limb BMD relates to common local, possibly biomechanical, rather than systemic factors. ; Section 5.3 examines change in knee structure in a population with prevalent osteoarthritis disease in Women lose patella cartilage at a faster rate than men: a 4.5year cohort study of subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Annual change in patella cartilage volume over 4.5 years in this population was lost at a higher rate in women compared to men, after accounting for age, BMI and bone volume at baseline. ; Socioeconomic status and endstage osteoarthritis ; Finally, the relationship between SES and endstage osteoarthritis is examined, ; whereby all knee and hip joint replacements performed for osteoarthritis in residents ; of the BSD during 2006-7 were examined for an association with SES. Section 5.4 ; presents an analysis of 691 total knee replacements, and showed that after adjusting for multiple comparisons, a trend for difference between SES quintiles was observed; however, this was not linear. In Section 5.5, Socioeconomic status and primary total hip joint replacements 2006-7 in the Barwon Statistical Division: Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry, presents a similar ; analysis of 642 total hip replacements across SES, and showed that there appeared a ; bimodal trend for total hip replacement incidence rates to be higher in the upper and lower SES quintiles for males, but not for females.",,,,,Socioeconomic status; Demography; Physical therapy; Cohort study; Joint replacement registry; Osteoarthritis; Osteoporosis; Hip fracture; Lower risk; Population; Medicine,,,,,http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/488898 https://monash.figshare.com/articles/Socioeconomic_status_and_modifiable_risk_factors_for_osteoporosis_and_knee_osteoarthritis_/4775137 https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/Socioeconomic_status_and_modifiable_risk_factors_for_osteoporosis_and_knee_osteoarthritis_/4775137 https://figshare.com/articles/Socioeconomic_status_and_modifiable_risk_factors_for_osteoporosis_and_knee_osteoarthritis_/4775137 https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Socioeconomic_status_and_modifiable_risk_factors_for_osteoporosis_and_knee_osteoarthritis_/4775137,http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/03/58d1d81198fa5,,10.4225/03/58d1d81198fa5,269293656,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The interactions and opinion formation of the noise traders are described by an extended O(n) vector model, which generalise the Ising model used previously in ABMs with a single risky asset. Efficient rejection-free transition probabilities are derived to describe realistic investment decisions at the micro level of individual noise traders. The ABM is validated by testing for several characteristics of financial markets such as volatility clustering and fat-tails of the distribution of returns. Furthermore, the model is able to account for the development of endogenous bubbles and crashes. We distinguish three different regimes depending on the traders’ propensity to imitate others. In the subcritical regime of the O(n) vector model, the traders’ opinions are idiosyncratic and no bubbles emerge. Around the critical value of the O(n) vector model, cross sectionally asynchronous bubbles emerge. Above the critical value, small random price fluctuations may be amplified by noise traders herding into a given asset, which then impels fundamentalists to re-equilibrate their more valuable portfolios that have become unbalanced, thus pushing the prices of the other assets upward. The resulting transient increase of the momenta of these assets triggers a reorientation of the noise traders’ portfolios that further amplifies the burgeoning bubbles. We have thus identified a mechanism by which the cautious risk-adverse contrarian rebalancing strategy of fundamentalists leads to systemic risks in the form of cascades of bubbles spreading the whole financial market.",,,,,Econometrics; Economics; Herding; Trend following; Financial market; Asset (economics); Economic bubble; Volatility clustering; Contrarian; Agent-based model,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/chf/rpseri/rp2176.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/chf/rpseri/rp2176.html,,,3211609647,,0,,0,False,,,lens
101-925-099-284-02X,Financial Regulation in the Bitcoin Era,2018-03-23,2018.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,William J. Magnuson,"The recent decade has witnessed an extraordinary degree of innovation in the financial sector. Developments in financial technology, computing power, and networking theory have allowed decentralized online platforms such as Bitcoin to fundamentally change the way that financial services are provided. While these innovations have been applauded by many as bringing a welcome degree of competition to a sector long dominated by powerful incumbents, they also create a set of challenges for current financial regulation. How do fiduciary standards apply to algorithms? How does online finance affect the behavior of investors? And more generally, how can regulators monitor and constrain the financial industry when it is increasingly run by autonomous, dispersed computer networks? This Article argues that current financial regulation is inadequate to address the unique problems presented by the rise of Bitcoin and other fintech industries. In particular, these innovations raise concerns about the ability of financial regulation to promote three inter-related financial goals: the efficient allocation of capital, the protection of consumers, and the prevention of systemic risk. These goals, at the core of current approaches to financial regulation, are all challenged by fintech’s defining feature: its reliance on disembodied institutions and complex algorithms for its functioning. These traits render the traditional tools used by regulators to discipline markets—substantive behavioral obligations, the threat of sanctions, and the constraining effect of reputation—largely ineffective. The Article concludes by proposing a set of principles to guide lawmakers in designing a more effective financial regulatory structure for the Bitcoin era.",,,,,Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Cryptocurrency; Corporate law; Fiduciary; Sanctions; Market economy; Financial regulation; FinTech,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3148036 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3148036 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=3148036,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3148036,,,2789307213,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Miller; Mikhail V. Oet; Stephen J. Ong,"Growing complexity and episodic turmoil in the financial system call for reassessment of existing early warning systems (EWSs) for systemic risk. This paper critically reviews the extensive EWS literature and typology and proposes a new class of supervisory models. The paper also discusses important design implications for an efficient EWS. The new class of supervisory models for systemic risk should be built from an integrated perspective and model EWS according to the users' objectives and competencies. It should incorporate both microprudential and macroprudential perspectives, as well as the structural considerations of the financial system itself. From the financial supervisor's point of view, an EWS involves an ex ante approach to regulation designed to highlight conditions that have in the past been associated with systemic risk. Forward-looking supervisory instruments become more important as they allow ex ante policy action and can reduce the need for ex post regulation.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Ex-ante; Business; Systemic risk; Action (philosophy); Supervisor; Warning system; Public relations; Typology,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2244422 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2246110_code1446362.pdf?abstractid=2244422&mirid=1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2244422,,,1488508005,,0,003-241-929-682-933; 005-776-611-742-434; 009-891-534-271-286; 035-571-732-473-946; 042-353-954-368-584; 067-164-571-347-65X; 070-698-946-967-957; 071-160-523-411-393; 096-451-514-059-612; 111-686-816-892-210; 130-242-880-044-410; 185-734-971-748-671,8,False,,,lens

This is why more electricity storage systems will be required to make this transition happen. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and battery-electric vehicles (BEV) are seen as promising solutions to meet these needs. But they are not free of environmental impacts, including on climate change. What are these impacts? This is what this article is dealing with. It focuses on the Li-ion techno- logy, when inserted in a mature grid, stationary or movable. First we address the impact of individual battery units, through the analysis of two extensive scientiﬁc literature reviews dealing with this topic. Then we consider the environmental footprint of services that BESS or BEV could bring to the community compared to traditional alternatives. As a conclusion, we draw a path to improve this environmental footprint, not only dealing with climate change aspects but also with other systemic risks such as raw material depletion.

Following the Cobb-Douglas production function approach, a power-law relationship between equity and debt for each bank become apparent. Furthermore, two variable regression analyses about the power-law relationship were conducted, and it was determined that the parameter estimate can be used as an index measuring macroeconomic condition. No correlation was found between the capital adequacy ratio and the return on equity, which are well-known indicators to characterize bank properties in a quantitative manner.

The historical and economic aspects of the emergence of factory cities in tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, the role of the phenomenon of single-industry towns in the development of the domestic material and technological base are investigated. It is indicated that the peak of the development of the single-industry model of management occurred during the existence of the planned economy in the USSR, but in the modern market model, the functioning of single-industry towns turned into a tangible state problem due to the under-fulfillment of social functions by city-forming enterprises. The most significant systemic (natural) and non-systemic (accidental) risks affecting the functioning of single-industry towns in modern conditions and contributing to their extinction are considered. The applied aspect of the article is that its conclusions can be used by public authorities in drawing up programs for regional development and reform of single-industry settlements.</jats:p>",22,3,246,250,Human settlement; Context (archaeology); Factory (object-oriented programming); Economy; Metropolitan area; Business; Economics; Economic system; Market economy; Geography; Archaeology; Computer science; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18500/1818-9601-2022-22-3-246-250,,10.18500/1818-9601-2022-22-3-246-250,,,0,,0,True,,gold,lens

Turk,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and scholars have fixated on the problem of “too-big-to-fail” banks. This fixation, however, overlooks the historically dominant pattern in banking crises: the contemporaneous failure of many small institutions. We call this blind spot the “too-many-to-fail” problem and document how its neglect has skewed the past decade of financial regulation. In particular, we argue that, for so-called community banks, there has been a pronounced and unjustifiable shift toward deregulation, culminating in sweeping regulatory rollbacks in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018.; ; As this Article demonstrates, this deregulatory trend rests on three myths. First, that community banks do not contribute to systemic risk and were not central to the 2008 crisis. Second, that the Dodd-Frank Act imposed regulatory burdens that threaten the survival of the community bank sector. And third, that community banks cannot remain viable without special subsidies or regulatory advantages. While these claims have gained near-universal acceptance among legal scholars and policymakers, none of them withstands scrutiny. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, community banks were key participants in the 2008 crisis, were not uniquely burdened by post-crisis reforms, and continue to thrive economically. ; ; Dispelling these myths about the community bank sector leads to the conclusion that diligent oversight of community banks is necessary to preserve financial stability. Accordingly, this Article recommends a reversal of the community bank deregulatory trend and proposes affirmative reforms, including enhanced supervision and macro-prudential stress tests, that would help mitigate systemic risks in the community bank sector.",,,,,Economic policy; Business; Systemic risk; Consumer Protection Act; Conventional wisdom; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Financial regulation; Deregulation; Subsidy,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3503692 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3503692,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3503692,,10.2139/ssrn.3503692,2997991899,,0,012-160-179-235-22X; 015-813-489-780-447; 016-665-645-839-960; 024-684-301-778-416; 065-987-553-318-374; 101-513-335-223-982; 141-717-818-130-129; 151-285-206-397-662; 155-489-130-238-971; 172-854-957-905-815; 185-085-651-788-773,0,True,,green,lens
069-362-303-601-48X,INTERBANK LENDING PATTERNS AND FINANCIAL CONTAGION,,2005.0,,,,,,Paolo Emilio Mistrulli; Banca d'Italia,"Interbank markets allow banks to cope with specific liquidity shocks. At the same time, they may represent a channel for contagion since a bank default may spread to solvent banks through interbank linkages. This paper investigates the link between the structural evolution of the Italian interbank market and the risk of financial contagion in the 1990-2003 period. By using a unique data set on bilateral exposures for all Italian banks it adds to the existing literature aiming at measuring systemic risk in many respects. Firstly, it shows that the estimation procedure widely used by other authors to obtain bilateral exposures from aggregated data implies a large bias in the estimation of the extent of financial contagion and that the sign of the bias itself is ambiguous depending on the recovery rates of interbank exposures at default. Secondly, this paper compares domestic and foreign shocks indicating that, notwithstanding financial integration, domestic shocks are still more relevant than foreign ones. Finally, the availability of actual bilateral exposures allows to show that the interbank market structure changed from an almost “complete” one (where all banks are symmetrically financially linked) to a “multiple money center” structure (where the money centers are linked to some banks which are themselves not reciprocally linked). This structural change has implied that the risk of contagion has increased overtime, especially after the first half of the ’90s when financial consolidation gained momentum.",,,,,Financial economics; Business; Systemic risk; Interbank lending market; Market liquidity; Consolidation (business); Financial contagion; Overtime; Financial integration; Structural evolution; Monetary economics,,,,,http://econ.upf.edu/docs/seminars/mistrulli.pdf,http://econ.upf.edu/docs/seminars/mistrulli.pdf,,,2185605928,,0,001-683-318-475-332; 009-548-973-745-086; 012-509-654-435-861; 015-330-084-659-28X; 016-925-192-793-979; 021-663-749-315-338; 023-920-010-872-504; 024-351-190-580-451; 024-608-553-322-330; 026-277-648-555-398; 028-809-688-907-391; 031-709-011-755-787; 044-267-106-393-965; 051-577-212-134-18X; 065-327-126-170-308; 065-461-724-433-216; 067-160-857-197-994; 075-897-862-903-52X; 081-474-615-941-986; 129-478-976-930-228; 136-247-986-607-382; 146-446-624-313-533; 150-347-168-528-987; 161-926-073-817-466; 182-401-964-998-619; 183-376-861-980-736,25,False,,,lens

Therefore, based on the daily return of all a-shares in China, this paper constructs a dynamic complex network of individual stocks, and represents the systemic risk of the market using the average weighting degree, as well as the adjusted structural entropy, of the network. In order to eliminate the influence of disturbance factors, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) are used to decompose and reconstruct the sequences to obtain the evolution trend and periodic fluctuation of systemic risk. The results show that the systemic risk of China’s stock market as a whole shows a downward trend, and the periodic fluctuation of systemic risk has a long-term equilibrium relationship with the abnormal fluctuation of the stock market.

We also show that, under natural contracting assumptions, financial networks that emerge in equilibrium may be socially inefficient due to the presence of a network externality: even though banks take the effects of their lending, risk-taking and failure on their immediate creditors into account, they do not internalize the consequences of their actions on the rest of the network.",,,,,Financial economics; Systemic risk; Creditor; Economics; Credit risk; Financial networks; Financial contagion; Financial risk management; Monetary economics; Financial risk; Network effect,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/103433084 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2500504_code1428438.pdf?abstractid=2207439&mirid=5&type=2 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2207439 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2500504_code1428438.pdf?abstractid=2207439&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2500504_code1428438.pdf?abstractid=2207439&type=2 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2211345,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2211345,,10.2139/ssrn.2211345,2045874447,,0,000-710-981-710-057; 001-274-723-652-948; 003-758-832-327-304; 004-535-613-573-28X; 005-520-969-514-250; 006-381-442-206-445; 006-698-365-818-610; 008-698-011-030-028; 008-998-590-834-024; 009-068-105-687-08X; 010-960-383-710-502; 011-009-251-260-182; 016-798-036-818-696; 021-960-436-782-884; 022-430-744-457-23X; 022-947-986-793-502; 023-441-580-547-879; 025-106-161-427-260; 026-046-227-276-595; 026-498-101-094-953; 027-377-765-386-823; 028-878-803-471-618; 028-930-297-640-217; 028-944-263-209-493; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-352-937-146-744; 030-357-242-754-80X; 030-814-002-245-740; 032-621-982-512-358; 033-254-404-268-36X; 038-264-849-710-422; 038-595-391-621-757; 040-801-336-012-314; 042-387-243-987-771; 047-289-836-852-429; 048-780-134-846-231; 049-080-701-146-354; 049-823-349-861-862; 050-039-925-983-742; 053-795-920-040-035; 061-574-904-331-52X; 064-942-172-320-301; 065-327-126-170-308; 067-722-658-533-467; 072-646-498-509-300; 074-637-420-002-073; 076-412-786-621-755; 076-426-946-113-926; 088-149-451-347-256; 090-216-544-937-502; 091-384-088-522-133; 095-037-640-171-955; 096-064-513-917-005; 099-178-211-203-095; 102-386-741-603-558; 105-272-772-069-515; 106-163-355-670-207; 108-878-816-693-973; 112-177-257-303-301; 113-679-556-131-163; 117-402-859-908-332; 118-532-756-093-953; 121-887-254-790-493; 124-375-650-012-669; 134-953-293-460-58X; 139-600-896-331-005; 143-857-326-837-037; 145-141-201-645-081; 168-663-423-050-326; 170-360-543-426-141; 182-401-964-998-619; 186-288-472-634-652; 198-681-186-512-140; 199-720-787-744-364,69,True,cc-by-nc,green,lens

The period analyzed is particularly interesting because it includes an episode of financial adjustment induced by regulators in 2009. Results show that after this date, market connectivity dropped, leading to a smaller systemic risk. On the other hand, funding patterns changed, suggesting that banks in the core increased their liquidity needs. Those new patterns rise systemic risk.

But research also indicates that fund management in certain circumstances may contribute to the buildup of systemic risk and severity of financial crises. The global financial crisis provided a number of new experiences on the contribution of fund managers to systemic risk. In this article, we focus on these lessons from the crisis. We distinguish between three sources of systemic risk in the financial system that may arise from fund management: insufficient credit risk transfer to fund managers; runs on funds that cause sudden reductions in funding to banks and other financial entities; and contagion through business ties between fund managers and their sponsors. Our discussion relates to the current intense debate on the role the so-called shadow banking system played in the global financial crisis. Several regulatory initiatives have been launched or suggested to reduce the systemic risk arising from non-bank financial entities, and we briefly discuss the likely impact of these on the sources of systemic risk outlined in the article.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Investment management; Liquidity risk; Financial market; Financial crisis; Shadow banking system; Credit risk transfer; Business ties; Financial system,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dip:dpaper:2013-06 https://ideas.repec.org/p/dip/dpaper/2013-06.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dip:dpaper:2013-06,,,3125602898,,0,,0,False,,,lens

This paper examines these proposals. Although OTC derivatives did not cause the crisis, they do facilitate large speculative transactions and have the potential to create systemic risk. The main attraction of the central clearing proposals is that they will make positions in standardised derivatives more transparent. However, our experience from the 2007-2009 crisis suggests that large losses by fi nancial institutions often arise from their positions in non-standard OTC derivatives. The paper argues that one way forward for regulators is to require all OTC derivatives (standard and non-standard) to be cleared centrally within three years. This would maximise the benefits of netting and reduce systemic risk while making it easier for regulators to carry out stress tests. The paper divides OTC derivatives into four categories and suggests how each category could be handled for clearing purposes.",,14,71,78,Accounting; Clearing; Clearance; Systemic risk; Economics; Carry (investment); Financial crisis; Out stress; Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bfr:fisrev:2010:14:9 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bfr/fisrev/2010149.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bfr:fisrev:2010:14:9,,,1559204245,,0,008-493-116-290-572; 026-730-795-248-446; 071-398-192-478-461; 079-021-369-557-896; 079-561-992-293-543; 140-171-178-190-175; 161-458-316-385-385; 163-754-372-369-776,26,False,,,lens

Compared with American shadow banking system,it is unique in several aspects. The strong financing needs,the diversity of investment channels of individuals as well as the regulatory arbitrage contribute to the rapid development of Chinese shadow banking system from the time it started. On the one hand,Chinese shadow banking system expands the efficiency boundary and service groups of financial system,relieving the financing difficulty. However,on the other hand,the maturity mismatch,high risk infectiousness and high hidden feature added by new financial risk by Internet finance have exacerbated the complexity of the financial risks and financial instability of shadow banking system.

In a two-country and three-period model, correlated asset fire sales by banks generate systemic risk across national financial markets. Relaxing regulatory standards in one country increases both the cost and the severity of crises for both countries in this framework. In the absence of coordination, independent regulators choose inefficiently low levels of macro-prudential regulation. A central regulator internalizes the systemic risk and thereby can improve the welfare of coordinating countries. Symmetric countries always benefit from coordination. Asymmetric countries choose different levels of macro-prudential regulation when they act independently.

This document aims to analyse the circumstances that have brought about this radical change. We will first explore the period between 1997 and 2007, characterised by sustained credit growth and the formation of a real-estate bubble of unprecedented proportions in the Spanish economy. We will then focus on two main aspects related to the banking regulatory framework: the implementation of dynamic provisions by the national bank supervisory authority (Banco de Espana) designed to cope with expected losses rooted in procyclical bank lending behaviour and the role played by the implementation of the Basel II framework with respect to credit risk.

Badimon,"Abstract The propensity of plaque to disrupt is a major determinant of future ischemic events. Although they are distinct from one another, the atherosclerotic and thrombotic processes appear to be interdependent and may be integrated under the term “atherothrombosis.” It is now clear that plaque composition, rather than the percent stenosis, is a major determinant of plaque vulnerability. Plaque disruption seems to depend on both passive and active phenomena and is not purely mechanical. Inflammation (activation of monocytes/macrophages) is a major determinant of both plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity as they relate to plaque disruption. In one-third of acute coronary syndromes, there is, however, no plaque disruption but only superficial erosion of a markedly stenotic, fibrotic plaque. In these cases, thrombus formation may be exacerbated by a hyperthrombogenic state present in patients with certain systemic risk factors. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis and hemostasis. This dynamic organ regulates blood thrombogenicity as well as contractile, secretory, and mitogenic activities in the vessel wall. Some classic risk factors induce endothelial dysfunction by reducing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, increasing tissue endothelin-1, and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Vascular hemostasis, which is the maintenance of blood fluidity and vascular integrity, is achieved by counter-balancing the intrinsic clotting tendency of blood.

We illustrated how theoretical models, such as Kyle's model, of agents' interplay in the financial markets, are aligned with the phenomena observed in publicly available trades and quotes data. Specifically, we confirmed that for small signed order-flows, the price impact grows linearly with increase in the order-flow imbalance. We have, further, implemented a machine learning algorithm to forecast market impact given a signed order-flow. Our findings suggest that machine learning models can be used in estimation of financial variables; and predictive accuracy of such learning algorithms can surpass the performance of traditional statistical approaches.; ; Understanding the determinants of price impact is crucial for several reasons. From a theoretical stance, modelling the impact provides a statistical measure of liquidity. Practitioners adopt impact models as a pre-trade tool to estimate expected transaction costs and optimize the execution of their strategies. This further serves as a post-trade valuation benchmark as suboptimal execution can significantly deteriorate a portfolio performance.; ; More broadly, the price impact reflects the balance of liquidity across markets.

SRISK represents a function of the firm's financial size, its degree of leverage and its expected equity loss conditional on a market downturn. We employ the SRISK to examine the systemic risk of top Greek financial institutions between June 2007 and December 2014 which corresponds to the period of the financial crisis of 2007. The results show that after the crisis of 2007, the SRISK reached its maximum during 2012 and 2013. Then, we find that the Bank of Greece, the National Bank, Piraeus Bank, the Eurobank Ergasias and the Alpha Bank present the top of systemic risk in Greece.

182-560-527-573-856,Does Field Research Inhibit the Selective Disclosure of Listed Companies,2021-02-17,2021.0,,,,,,Liu Chen; Lv Kefu; Ruan Yongping,"At present, the Chinese capital market is generally in the emerging and transitional stage, and the problem of information asymmetry between accounting information providers and general users is still widespread, leading to the inefficiency and systemic risks of capital market resource allocation. Private communication and public disclosure, as the main methods for market participants to obtain company information, have received widespread attention for their role in reducing information asymmetry in the capital market. The academic community has also conducted rich and detailed discussions on this. They find that private communication is a powerful supplement to public disclosure and the two are playing active roles together in strengthening the normal information transmission mechanism of the market, reducing the company’s systemic financial risks, and helping market participants make correct investment judgments and decisions. However, there is still a lack of research on the impact of private communication on public disclosure. The discussion of this issue can not only enrich the related research on private communication and information disclosure, but also analyze the motivation of the information disclosure behavior of listed companies, and provide new ideas for alleviating the information asymmetry of the capital market.This paper uses 2007-2019 listed companies in China as a research sample to examine the impact of field investigation, a private communication method, on company information disclosure. The research finds that:（1）Field investigations will lead to selective information disclosure by companies, that is, upward performance adjustments and reduction of risk information disclosure in annual report.（2）The mechanism research finds that field investigation can increase the market pressure faced by listed companies by increasing analyst attention and media attention, thus leading to the selective information disclosure.（3）Executives play important roles in the selective disclosure. When they have higher salary, they are more motivated to conduct trench defense and their selective information disclosure behaviors are also more obvious.（4）Further research shows that field investigations will affect the company’s accounting conservatism and the comparability of accounting information, leading to an increase in the level of information asymmetry between the company and the market.On the basis of existing research, the possible contributions of this paper are mainly reflected in the following aspects. First of all, it enriches the economic consequences of field investigation literature. Existing research has verified the governance effect of field research mainly from the perspectives of market reaction and analyst forecasts, while this paper innovatively discusses the topic from the perspective of company selective disclosure. The results show that field research will lead to selective information disclosure by companies, that is, upward performance adjustments and reduction of risk information disclosure in annual report, thus confirming the pressure effect of field research. Secondly, from the perspectives of accounting information comparability and accounting information conservatism, it shows that this “blind-eye” type of information whitewashing behavior will not only disturb the audiovisual, but also distort the normal information transmission mechanism of the market and aggravate the company’s information asymmetry. Finally, it confirms that executives may make discretionary choices regarding the public disclosure of information driven by market pressure. This helps to deepen the understanding of investors on company information disclosure, and provides a new perspective for government functional departments to strengthen the supervision of selective disclosure of accounting digital information and text information.",43,02,20,35,Accounting; Information asymmetry; Business; Systemic risk; Accounting information system; Public disclosure; Selective disclosure; Earnings management; Corporate governance; Financial risk,,,,,https://qks.sufe.edu.cn/J/PDFFull/a0e6a1a9-03b4-4422-9029-4627004017a0.pdf https://qks.sufe.edu.cn/J/WJGL/Article/Details/a0e6a1a9-03b4-4422-9029-4627004017a0,https://qks.sufe.edu.cn/J/WJGL/Article/Details/a0e6a1a9-03b4-4422-9029-4627004017a0,,,3131915869,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Under this new framework, systemic risk measures can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash that secures the aggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual risks. This problem has no explicit solution except in very limited situations. Deep learning is increasingly receiving attention in financial modelings and risk management and we propose our deep learning based algorithms to solve both the primal and dual problems of the risk measures, and thus to learn the fair risk allocations. In particular, our method for the dual problem involves the training philosophy inspired by the well-known Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) approach and a newly designed direct estimation of Radon-Nikodym derivative. We close the paper with substantial numerical studies of the subject and provide interpretations of the risk allocations associated to the systemic risk measures. In the particular case of exponential preferences, numerical experiments demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed algorithm, when compared with the optimal explicit solution as a benchmark.",,,,,Benchmark (surveying); Dual (grammatical number); Systemic risk; Computer science; Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Adversarial system; Mathematical optimization; Risk analysis (engineering); Machine learning; Mathematics; Economics; Business; Art; Literature; Financial crisis; Geodesy; Macroeconomics; Geography,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2207.00739,,10.48550/arxiv.2207.00739,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

Gerding,"This article proposes several simple financial market reforms that can help regulators both identify systemically risky institutions and mitigate the systemic risk associated with derivative trading, especially trading in credit derivatives such as credit default swaps. The Federal Reserve (or other systemic risk regulator) should require that financial institutions publicly disclose detailed information on all credit derivatives in their portfolio - including counterparties and notional value - on a frequent basis. The notional value of credit derivatives provides a gauge of the maximum amount the derivative seller must pay the buyer if the underlying credit instrument defaults. Although the notional value is not a good indicator of a derivative’s market value (it is unlikely that each contract in the portfolio would have to be settled for the full notional amount), the notional value of all credit derivatives in an institution’s portfolio is a powerful indicator of the systemic risk posed by that institution’s investments because it is the maximum amount the institution could owe to (or be owed by) other institutions in an extreme event such as the 2008 credit freeze. The government should use this disclosure to identify which financial institutions are “systemically significant.” Any institution whose credit derivative portfolio has a notional value exceeding a certain threshold for a several days would be regulated for several years as a “Tier 1 Financial Holding Company” per the Administration’s proposal. Exchange-traded derivatives should not count in the notional value threshold for systemic significance, creating an incentive to move OTC contracts to exchanges.",,,,,Business; Notional amount; Credit event; Credit reference; Credit default swap; Credit derivative; Financial system; Credit valuation adjustment; Credit default swap index; Derivatives market,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1477487_code219969.pdf?abstractid=1475366 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1477487_code219969.pdf?abstractid=1475366&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1475366,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1475366,,,1527480068,,0,,1,False,,,lens

The considered model extends one originally proposed to study systemic risk in networks of financial institutions interconnected by mutual obligations. It is one of the simplest continuous models accounting for shock propagation phenomena and cascading failure effects. This model also characterizes Nash equilibria of constrained quadratic network games with strategic complementarities. We first derive explicit expressions for network equilibria and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for their uniqueness, encompassing and generalizing results available in the literature. Then, we study jump discontinuities of the network equilibria when the exogenous flows cross certain regions of measure 0 representable as graphs of continuous functions. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results in the two main motivating applications. In financial networks, this bifurcation phenomenon is responsible for how small shocks in the assets of a few nodes can trigger major aggregate losses to the system and cause the default of several agents. In constrained quadratic network games, it induces a blow-up behavior of the sensitivity of Nash equilibria with respect to the individual benefits. </jats:p>",47,3,1781,1801,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/moor.2021.1188,,10.1287/moor.2021.1188,,,0,000-182-913-048-413; 006-920-458-311-629; 010-587-594-989-352; 011-193-040-395-047; 012-430-523-378-543; 014-596-805-007-68X; 029-652-108-487-444; 031-500-031-831-540; 037-731-544-912-238; 040-717-485-874-354; 048-297-576-911-977; 052-908-871-358-013; 053-173-014-782-735; 053-259-079-140-976; 059-244-507-462-880; 059-989-160-294-174; 060-863-947-795-345; 077-436-811-650-375; 078-964-547-449-925; 087-942-623-697-437; 104-284-421-104-309; 106-006-716-801-42X; 107-883-325-006-286; 111-261-068-794-338; 113-315-048-372-078; 149-204-106-384-830; 159-483-026-074-426; 162-482-560-911-945; 185-247-218-125-062; 187-600-112-061-571,3,True,,green,lens

Laying aside market economy principles, governments were forced to rescue banks whose insolvency could have put the stability of the financial system in jeopardy. Amid such massive state intervention, competition is no longer able to perform its selection and allocation function. Reform concepts have to be aimed at avoiding situations in which governments see themselves once again forced to rescue financial institutions. One possible approach consists in providing a legal framework in which the adverse effects of banking crises and insolvencies – or systemic risk – are reduced. In this context the paper discusses three approaches of risk reduction and prevention: the introduction of „living wills“ for banks, modifications to close-out netting and clearing through central counterparties (CCPs). DeutschDie Finanzkrise hat weltweit zu staatlichen Markteingriffen in einem zuvor kaum vorstellbaren Ausmas gefuhrt. Staaten sahen sich in Durchbrechung marktwirtschaftlicher Prinzipien zur Rettung von Banken gezwungen, deren Insolvenz die Stabilitat des Finanzsystems hatte gefahrden konnen. Der Wettbewerb kann bei einer so massiven Staatsintervention seine Auslese- und Allokationsfunktionen nicht mehr erfullen. Reformuberlegungen mussen darauf gerichtet sein, Situationen vorzubeugen, in denen Staaten sich erneut zur Rettung von Finanzinstituten gezwungen sehen.

Born preterm with small gestation age (SGA) may be an additional risk factor for developing ROP. The study was conducted to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and severity of ROP in SGA newborns admitted to the newborn nursery. Materials and methods: 91 preterm infants were screened for ROP in a prospective observational study conducted in a teaching hospital in central Maharashtra, India using the National Neonatology Forum of India criteria (NNF, 2010). Systemic risk factors and ocular findings were documented. The incidence, risk factors, and severity of ROP were compared between the SGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns. Results: The incidence of ROP was 36.26% (total), 39.62% (SGA), and 31.57% (AGA) amongst screened infants. ROP was more common in babies with higher gestational age (35.4 weeks; p = 0.064) in the SGA group, and it was more in babies with lesser gestational age (32.2 weeks; p = 0.033) in the AGA group. There was no difference in the risk factors between the two groups on univariate and multivariate analysis. Conclusions: The incidence of ROP was higher in SGA infants than AGA infants in the present study. However, there was no difference in the risk factors and severity of ROP between the two groups.",6,0,83,88,Pediatrics; Gestational age; Retinopathy of prematurity; Small for gestational age; Multivariate analysis; Incidence (epidemiology); Gestation; Risk factor; Neonatology; Medicine,,,,,https://journals.viamedica.pl/ophthalmology_journal/article/download/OJ.2021.0016/64234 https://journals.viamedica.pl/ophthalmology_journal/article/view/OJ.2021.0016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5603/oj.2021.0016,,10.5603/oj.2021.0016,3202803092,,0,,0,True,cc-by-nc-nd,gold,lens

Methods Charts of patients who required single or multiple surgical debridements of epithelial ingrowth were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed to identify preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors. Results Fourteen of 22 patients had epithelial ingrowth that required a single surgical removal. These were mostly associated with the surgeon's learning curve, epithelial injury, and enhancement by lifting the flap. Multiple surgical debridements were required in eight patients and some of these were associated with epithelial basement membrane degeneration and a history of type I diabetes. Conclusions Refractive surgeons should be aware of surgical and non-surgical ocular and systemic risk factors associated with both primary and recurrent epithelial ingrowth after LASIK to appropriately consent patients seeking refractive surgery.

In today’s crowded and interconnected world, disaster impacts increasingly cascade across geographies and sectors, as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are rapidly making clear. Despite progress, risk creation is outstripping risk reduction. Disasters, economic loss, and the underlying vulnerabilities that drive risk, such as poverty and inequality, are increasing just as ecosystems and biospheres are at risk of collapse. The report highlights that a) the climate emergency and the systemic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic point to a new reality; b) understanding and reducing risk in a world of uncertainty is fundamental to achieving genuinely sustainable development; and c) the best defense against future shocks is to transform systems now, to build resilience by addressing climate change, and to reduce the vulnerability, exposure, and inequality that drive disasters.",,,,,Disaster risk reduction; Vulnerability (computing); Resilience (materials science); Climate change; Environmental planning; Pandemic; Corporate governance; Inequality; Poverty; Psychological resilience; Business; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Environmental resource management; Geography; Political science; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Economic growth; Economics; Computer science; Computer security; Medicine; Mathematics; Psychotherapist; Ecology; Mathematical analysis; Pathology; Biology; Psychology; Thermodynamics; Physics; Disease; Finance; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Law,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

Lambris; George Hajishengallis,"The C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (C5aR; CD88) is activated as part of the complement cascade and exerts important inflammatory, antimicrobial, and regulatory functions, at least in part, via crosstalk with TLRs. However, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can control C5aR activation by generating C5a through its own C5 convertase-like enzymatic activity. In this paper, we show that P. gingivalis uses this mechanism to proactively and selectively inhibit TLR2-induced IL-12p70, whereas the same pathogen-instigated C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk upregulates other inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). In vivo, the ability of P. gingivalis to manipulate TLR2 activation via the C5a-C5aR axis allowed it to escape IL-12p70-dependent immune clearance and to cause inflammatory bone loss in a murine model of experimental periodontitis. In the latter regard, C5aR-deficient or TLR2-deficient mice were both resistant to periodontal bone loss, in stark contrast with wild-type control mice, which is consistent with the interdependent interactions of C5aR and TLR2 in P. gingivalis immune evasion and induction of bone-resorptive cytokines. In conclusion, P. gingivalis targets C5aR to promote its adaptive fitness and cause periodontal disease. Given the current availability of safe and effective C5aR antagonists, pharmacological blockade of C5aR could act therapeutically in human periodontitis and reduce associated systemic risks.",186,2,869,877,Complement system; Interleukin 10; Immunology; C5a receptor; Periodontal pathogen; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Periodontitis; TLR2; Biology; Immune system,,"Alveolar Bone Loss/immunology; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Immune Evasion/genetics; Inflammation Mediators/metabolism; Interleukin-10/physiology; Interleukin-12/antagonists & inhibitors; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/physiology; Periodontitis/immunology; Porphyromonas gingivalis/growth & development; Receptor Cross-Talk/immunology; Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a/deficiency; Signal Transduction/genetics; Toll-Like Receptor 2/antagonists & inhibitors","Inflammation Mediators; Myd88 protein, mouse; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a; Tlr2 protein, mouse; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Interleukin-10; Interleukin-12",NIGMS NIH HHS (R01 GM062134-08) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (R01 DE015254) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R01 AI-068730) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (DE017138) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (R01 DE017138-07) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (R01 GM-62134) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (DE018292) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (R01 DE018292-05) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (P01 AI068730-05) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (DE021580) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (DE015254) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (R01 GM062134) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (R01 DE017138) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (R01 DE018292) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (RC4 DE021580-01) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (RC4 DE021580) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (P01 AI068730) United States; NIDCR NIH HHS (R01 DE015254-09) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075594/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3075594 https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/2/869.full https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21149611/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149611 https://www.jimmunol.org/lookup/doi/10.4049/jimmunol.1003252,http://dx.doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1003252,21149611,10.4049/jimmunol.1003252,2155905632,PMC3075594,3,000-425-858-708-151; 001-857-791-509-945; 005-239-456-301-466; 005-982-196-956-01X; 009-048-022-542-741; 009-728-078-630-344; 009-841-075-911-217; 010-542-326-825-600; 011-254-386-043-555; 012-721-849-081-037; 014-002-819-553-808; 017-929-492-967-728; 018-772-470-282-158; 019-980-881-829-421; 020-466-352-419-439; 027-030-197-775-202; 028-940-339-277-41X; 032-594-028-800-109; 032-838-025-710-616; 036-171-486-288-879; 036-368-272-014-337; 040-738-210-607-655; 042-441-773-346-976; 043-095-743-193-849; 046-042-144-895-793; 052-053-884-197-609; 052-700-796-223-297; 054-095-693-896-923; 056-259-148-171-071; 056-710-788-706-349; 060-182-253-345-813; 060-787-290-295-52X; 062-440-610-713-314; 063-528-907-037-532; 065-381-969-286-090; 065-655-206-608-632; 075-605-426-654-902; 076-936-304-004-461; 077-474-100-617-349; 077-495-590-923-682; 077-784-831-643-237; 079-979-722-141-492; 083-139-121-617-531; 084-766-083-252-533; 098-289-107-806-289; 100-080-409-613-733; 101-714-883-055-677; 105-080-215-267-993; 110-502-210-470-974; 154-259-086-408-397; 161-934-235-239-516; 178-316-337-248-439,142,True,,green,lens

He defines a new systemic risk score that depends on the level of individual risk at each financial institution and the interconnectedness across institutions; this score is generally applicable irrespective of how interconnectedness is defined. This risk metric is decomposable into risk contributions from each entity, forming a basis for taxing each entity appropriately. The authors shows that we may calculate risk increments to assess the potential risk of each entity on the overall financial system. The article develops other subsidiary risk measures, such as system fragility and entity criticality. An assessment using a measure of spillover risk is obtained to determine the scale of externalities that one bank might impose on the system; the metric is robust to this cross-risk and does not induce predatory spillovers. The analysis in this article suggests that splitting up too-big-to-fail banks does not lower systemic risk.",18,4,33,51,Business; Systemic risk; Externality; Actuarial science; Metric (unit); Risk metric; Financial institution; Spillover effect; Scale (social sciences); Interconnectedness,,,,,https://jai.pm-research.com/content/18/4/33,http://dx.doi.org/10.3905/jai.2016.18.4.033,,10.3905/jai.2016.18.4.033,3125495063,,0,001-274-723-652-948; 008-620-705-366-714; 009-248-782-454-29X; 010-136-645-510-231; 023-441-580-547-879; 026-046-227-276-595; 028-626-642-851-909; 029-652-108-487-444; 039-259-518-809-057; 040-717-485-874-354; 043-647-549-943-573; 045-777-161-498-037; 052-619-799-818-546; 058-317-845-969-869; 058-879-947-933-394; 062-665-995-202-765; 064-299-895-727-973; 069-415-777-201-206; 073-141-158-334-957; 078-709-728-254-301; 083-508-652-775-775; 088-149-451-347-256; 102-386-741-603-558; 114-429-214-608-368; 127-943-185-860-76X; 134-520-815-461-982; 134-742-706-602-559; 136-106-944-186-234; 148-145-932-316-828; 164-647-286-298-310; 170-468-513-196-685; 181-012-604-532-529; 190-822-347-117-367; 195-489-530-337-558; 196-341-480-069-844,37,False,,,lens

Castillo; Donald B. Kimmel,"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a potentially severe adverse event affecting patients with cancer and patients with osteoporosis who have been treated with powerful antiresorptives (pARs) or angiogenesis inhibitors (AgIs). pARs, including nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs; e.g., zoledronic acid, alendronate) and anti-RANKL antibodies (e.g., denosumab), are used to manage bone metastases in patients with cancer or to prevent fragility fractures in patients with osteoporosis. Though significant advances have been made in understanding MRONJ, its pathophysiology is still not fully elucidated. Multiple species have been used in preclinical MRONJ research, including the rat, mouse, rice rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, and pig. Animal research has contributed immensely to advancing the MRONJ field, particularly, but not limited to, in developing models and investigating risk factors that were first observed in humans. MRONJ models have been developed using clinically relevant doses of systemic risk factors, like N-BPs, anti-RANKL antibodies, or AgIs. Specific local oral risk factors first noted in humans, including tooth extraction and inflammatory dental disease (e.g., periodontitis, periapical infection, etc.), were then added. Research in rodents, particularly the rat, and, to some extent, the mouse, across multiple laboratories, has contributed to establishing multiple relevant and complementary preclinical models. Models in larger species produced accurate clinical and histopathologic outcomes suggesting a potential role for confirming specific crucial findings from rodent research. We view the current state of animal models for MRONJ as good. The rodent models are now reliable enough to produce large numbers of MRONJ cases that could be applied in experiments testing treatment modalities. The course of MRONJ, including stage 0 MRONJ, is characterized well enough that basic studies of the molecular or enzyme-level findings in different MRONJ stages are possible. This review provides a current overview of the existing models of MRONJ, their more significant features and findings, and important instances of their application in preclinical research.",153,,116184,,Cancer;

110-434-975-158-622,Obelix vs. Asterix : size of US commercial banks and its regulatory challenge,2015-04-01,2015.0,journal article,Journal of Regulatory Economics,0922680x; 15730468,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Diego A. Restrepo-Tobón; Subal C. Kumbhakar; Kai Sun,"Big banks pose substantial costs to society in the form of increased systemic risk and government bailouts during crises. So the question is: Should regulators limit the size of banks? To answer this question, regulators need to assess the potential costs of such regulations. If big banks enjoy substantial scale economies (i.e., average costs get lower as bank size increases), limiting the size of banks through regulations may be inefficient and likely to reduce social welfare. However, the literature offers conflicting results regarding the existence of economies of scale for the biggest US banks. We contribute to this literature using a novel approach to estimating nonparametric measures of scale economies and total factor productivity (TFP) growth. For US commercial banks, we find that around 73 % of the top one hundred banks, 98 % of medium and small banks, and seven of the top ten biggest banks by asset size exhibit substantial economies of scale. Likewise, we find that scale economies contribute positively and significantly to their TFP growth. The existence of substantial scale economies raises an important challenge for regulators to pursue size limit regulations.",48,2,125,168,Finance; Total factor productivity; Systemic risk; Economics; Returns to scale; Public finance; Asset (economics); Bank regulation; Economies of scale; Social Welfare; Monetary economics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11149-015-9275-1 https://usir.salford.ac.uk/34559/1/TFP_US_BANKS_Feb2015_SpringerLatex.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/article/kapregeco/v_3a48_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a125-168.htm https://core.ac.uk/display/47251086 https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/34559/ https://repository.eafit.edu.co/handle/10784/7615 https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/regeco/v48y2015i2p125-168.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11149-015-9275-1.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11149-015-9275-1,,10.1007/s11149-015-9275-1,2061949763,,0,000-261-595-353-257; 004-167-713-260-778; 005-646-580-176-066; 006-585-946-945-799; 006-608-440-630-06X; 007-258-029-785-554; 008-028-013-130-580; 008-507-393-834-384; 013-102-994-829-818; 013-349-510-266-305; 014-067-277-762-679; 014-253-548-201-988; 014-836-111-797-410; 017-370-002-106-913; 018-888-552-163-181; 019-295-642-867-732; 020-239-790-036-454; 020-677-548-552-987; 024-233-862-032-312; 024-266-008-075-349; 025-160-687-617-39X; 025-575-564-226-000; 026-787-831-234-269; 027-107-605-117-448; 028-857-314-720-860; 029-718-186-903-81X; 031-305-324-919-120; 034-048-238-013-976; 034-077-147-140-251; 035-502-436-111-175; 035-934-853-408-382; 040-174-731-575-387; 040-888-605-165-04X; 040-911-465-560-760; 041-768-012-874-254; 044-287-405-042-039; 044-812-142-228-677; 052-343-199-746-572; 053-291-907-257-062; 053-382-158-869-224; 054-993-371-929-969; 056-292-751-597-098; 056-570-638-703-968; 056-715-715-680-89X; 057-926-597-770-259; 060-667-921-273-962; 061-097-614-849-938; 061-844-823-797-261; 062-130-308-163-100; 063-089-905-896-18X; 063-109-821-303-741; 063-576-802-942-743; 065-778-206-968-283; 066-535-747-067-410; 072-502-179-217-076; 075-505-153-688-665; 078-455-438-867-698; 078-517-292-089-723; 081-501-832-386-561; 083-528-229-440-810; 085-269-874-187-466; 085-906-755-520-181; 090-021-715-677-021; 094-976-496-341-620; 098-918-091-371-776; 100-343-251-467-589; 104-438-981-895-291; 105-195-752-744-521; 109-188-091-891-910; 109-977-375-154-981; 111-699-717-828-961; 114-726-697-607-167; 115-145-689-725-869; 121-970-641-484-215; 127-202-775-010-820; 134-272-256-585-339; 137-768-992-328-013; 142-349-068-183-749; 143-006-183-719-352; 148-826-649-821-312; 159-643-047-747-95X; 163-395-545-951-325; 169-754-833-942-562; 173-090-430-986-005; 177-457-228-985-133; 183-433-192-889-449; 186-365-158-416-338,4,True,,green,lens

We summarize and classify 43 theoretical and empirical research papers from both academia and practitioner organizations. The survey reveals that traditional insurance activity in the life, non-life, and reinsurance sectors neither contributes to systemic risk, nor increases insurers' vulnerability to impairments of the financial system. However, non-traditional activities (e.g., CDS underwriting) might increase vulnerability and life insurers might be more vulnerable than non-life insurers due to higher leverage. Whether non-traditional activities also contribute to systemic risk is not entirely clear; however, the activities with the potential to contribute to systemic risk include underwriting financial derivatives, providing financial guarantees, and short-term funding.

Our approach is to examine episodes of banking sector distress for a large sample of countries, highlighting the experience of the EU. We estimate multivariate probit models linking the likelihood of banking problems to a set of macroeconomic variables and institutional characteristics. Institutional characteristics, made available by a new data set on corporate governance in the financial sector not previously used in this type of analysis, include aspects of bank supervision and regulation, restrictions on bank portfolios, and development of the banking system.

Therefore, studying the symbiotic coordination between water, energy and food is of great significance to promoting regional sustainable development. First, from the perspective of water–energy–food symbiosis, with the water–energy–food ecosystem conceptual model as the nexus, the two-step measurement model of the symbiotic index and the symbiotic level index is used to study the water–energy–food symbiosis of the Yangtze River. Then, we use the BP-DEMATEL-GTCW model to identify the key influencing factors that affect the symbiotic security of the water–energy–food ecosystem. In this research, it is found that the average value of the symbiotic degree of the water–energy–food ecosystem of the 11 provinces or municipalities in the Yangtze River Basin only reached the risk grade. It can also be seen from the identification results of key influencing factors that energy microsystem-related indicators have a greater impact on the symbiotic development of the entire WEF ecosystem. Therefore, special attention needs to be paid to increasing energy sources and reducing expenditure. Relevant departments need to effectively develop primary energy production and expand energy-saving investment through multiple channels to expand energy self-sufficiency and ultimately promote the coordinated and effective development of water, energy and food in the Yangtze River Basin.",23,7,798,,Environmental resource management; Structural basin; Ecosystem; Primary energy; Conceptual model; Business; Systemic risk; Nexus (standard); Energy source; Sustainable development,BP-DEMATEL-GTCW model; Lotka–Volterra model; Yangtze River Basin; game theory combination weight; key influencing factors identification; water–energy–food symbiotic coordination,,,Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Chinese Ministry of Education (No. 20YJA630006); National Natural Foundation for Young Scholars (No. 71403122),https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/7/798/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/7/798 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/entropy/entropy23.html#ChenC21 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34201631 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201631,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e23070798,34201631,10.3390/e23070798,3174664852,PMC8303784,0,000-411-279-700-887; 005-268-190-035-49X; 011-937-217-285-919; 012-782-506-244-411; 013-687-253-143-057; 013-833-400-068-775; 013-975-456-876-599; 017-575-030-714-149; 017-745-907-653-282; 023-596-320-973-499; 023-634-917-289-918; 023-932-828-049-133; 024-833-673-724-570; 026-265-929-558-538; 028-957-213-938-121; 030-373-386-892-54X; 030-670-846-945-931; 030-919-221-270-840; 031-040-181-431-927; 036-656-134-810-374; 038-801-843-155-692; 040-725-887-445-798; 045-999-099-036-301; 047-502-943-603-145; 049-358-596-030-408; 053-657-789-439-538; 054-042-721-562-543; 055-823-704-073-471; 058-542-112-653-585; 069-078-433-436-998; 072-233-408-640-554; 079-370-138-494-504; 083-763-077-795-806; 085-128-786-265-613; 094-170-961-723-892; 097-777-551-578-776; 098-437-302-824-177; 100-463-356-228-652; 105-885-644-434-671; 112-222-450-294-11X; 115-804-882-570-236; 120-742-234-840-576; 120-798-305-531-096; 134-789-895-085-914; 146-115-316-072-022; 159-436-028-163-340; 164-010-750-865-57X; 180-098-498-188-480; 186-292-390-551-804; 187-513-623-250-934,6,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Friedly; Christopher J. Standaert,"Local glucocorticoid injections are often used to treat joint, soft tissue, or spinal pain, but the systemic side effects associated with these injections are poorly understood and not well recognized. There are significant known risks to systemic administration of glucocorticoids. However, there are no guidelines that address issues of systemic absorption, overall systemic risks, or other side effects of locally injected glucocorticoids. For this review, a literature search was performed, and the available evidence on systemic absorption and clinical side effects of intra-articular and epidural glucocorticoids was synthesized. The goal was to improve clinical understanding of risks associated with these injections. Existing data suggest there is significant individual variability in the amount of systemic absorption and clinical effects of locally injected glucocorticoids. However, it is clear that both intra-articular and epidural injections can have systemic effects for weeks and that complications may be associated with their use, including Cushing syndrome, loss of bone density, infection, and hyperglycemia. The concurrent use of oral steroids, the number of injections, and the type and dose of glucocorticoids used all are important considerations in estimating risks. The total dose calculation of cumulative glucocorticoid exposure should include all local injections.

Better provider awareness of possible systemic risks should improve decision making and informed consent with patients when considering intra-articular and epidural steroid injections for painful conditions.

Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi, among others, are pinning much of their hopes for managing financial stability in the context of Basel III on macroprudentialism. Despite central banks’ clear intention that this policy will play a significant role in developed economies, few policymakers or financial players know what macroprudential policy is, much less how to assess its efficacy or necessity. The paper is a shorter version of a report on the same subject. It aims to clarify the concept of macroprudential policy for a broader audience, cultivating a better understanding of these tools and their implications for broader monetary policy going forward.",,,,,Monetary policy; Normalization (sociology); Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Subject (philosophy); Basel III; Context (language use); Financial stability; Monetary economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/68157.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/68157.html,,,3152151790,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Using a sample of large BHC in the USA, we find limited evidence that high pay sensitivity is positively associated with banks' crash risk. In addition, high pay sensitivity and weak governance increase the systemic risk of banks. This study provides empirical support that governance decisions impact banks' risk exposure differently compared to those of corporate firms: 1) in opposite to the desired direction; 2) in conflicting manner. The study lends thus more credence to the recent call for redesigning the incentives and monitoring structure of banking industry.

185-175-637-763-43X,Stress Testing the Banking Agencies,2019-04-06,2019.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Matthew C. Turk,"One of the major regulatory innovations that has emerged over the decade following the financial crisis is the development of regulatory stress tests for large financial institutions. But the role of stress tests as a pillar of financial regulation has been placed in jeopardy by a recent wave of reforms within Congress and the Trump Administration. Existing legal scholarship provides minimal guidance for evaluating this development, because it lacks a coherent account of what the Dodd-Frank Act’s stress testing programs can and should do. This article fills that gap.; ; First, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the promise and limits of financial stress tests. That analysis reveals that both Dodd-Frank’s architects as well as its reformist skeptics have misconceived the vices and virtues of the post-crisis stress testing rules. As it stands, the current procedures bear surprisingly little relation to the systemic risks they were designed to address. At the same time, claims that those rules represent a harmful escalation of regulatory burdens, discretion or uncertainty are overstated. ; ; Second, the article moves beyond critique and charts a practical path forward by identifying a simple yet fundamental twist to the administration of stress tests which would enable them to effectively perform the functions they were intended to serve. Specifically, it outlines a set of reforms that transform stress tests into tool for diagnosing weaknesses in the regulatory requirements promulgated by federal banking agencies, rather than in the banks themselves. By stress testing for regulatory failure, the market failures which lead to financial crises are more likely to be prevented. ; ; The broader contribution of this article is to highlight the need for a genuinely interdisciplinary approach to financial regulation, which focuses on how subtle aspects of legal structure interact with the underlying economic principles governing financial markets. The post-crisis stress tests present a classic case on why taking both the law and economics of financial regulation seriously is easier said than done. But they also show that without such an approach, regulatory cost-and-benefits are misapprehended, basic policy questions prove impossible to answer, and unintended consequences abound.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Market failure; Law and economics; Financial market; Unintended consequences; Discretion; Financial crisis; Financial regulation; Stress testing (software),,,,,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3367546 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3367546,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3367546,,,2946454762,,0,,0,False,,,lens

071-653-670-685-453,Securing Monetary and Financial Stability: Why Canada Needs a Macroprudential Policy Framework,,2015.0,,C.D. Howe Institute Commentary,,,,Paul Jenkins; David Longworth,"Canada’s inflation-target agreement between the government and the Bank of Canada is up for renewal by 31 December 2016. In the aftermath of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, one of the critical issues for consideration is the integration of price and financial stability in the conduct of policy. This Commentary addresses the importance for the conduct of monetary policy of having a separate coherent framework for macroprudential policy – designed to prevent the build-up of systemic, or system-wide, financial risks. A key lesson of the financial crisis was the insufficient attention being paid to these risks and their consequences for the economy. The importance of this issue can be seen in two ways. The first relates to the interactions between monetary and macroprudential policy tools in light of concerns about rising levels of household debt. At various times, there will be situations when only one policy tool is needed, when both policies need to be used in the same direction, or when the two policies need to work in opposite directions. The second relates to the Bank’s current “risk management approach” to monetary policy. In the absence of a government framework for the active use of macroprudential tools, this approach implies that monetary policy becomes a more important line of defence against systemic risks than it needs to be, with the risk of sub-optimal monetary policy outcomes. Our conclusions are threefold: • Canada’s 2 percent inflation target and policy framework has served the economy well, most importantly in anchoring inflation expectations; • over the past two years, Canadian monetary policy would have been better placed to combat low inflation and excess capacity had macroprudential policies been openly geared to reducing the systemic risks associated with rising household indebtedness and housing prices; and • drawing on best practices, the government needs to elevate macroprudential policies by establishing clear objectives, tools and lines of responsibility and accountability. The payoff for Canadians cannot be overstated: greater assurance of both financial stability, as a result of assigned responsibility for macroprudential policy, and monetary stability, as a result of the Bank of Canada’s continued primary focus on inflation and output stabilization.",,429,,,Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Government; Economics; Inflation targeting; Household debt; Financial crisis; Monetary economics; Inflation; Financial risk,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/cdhcommen/429.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/cdh/commen/429.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/cdhcommen/429.htm,,,3125710069,,0,,4,False,,,lens

It shows what can be done with a systemic approach to improve risk management on different levels in different ways, and how systems thinking meets the challenges of increasing project complexity and the embedded risks. First, the benefits of a systemic perspective on projects in observing and describing actuality and possibility are explored, to provide a wider range of perspectives on the project itself and alternative ways to detect risk. The second part discusses why it is critical to establish risk management as an independent key practice in projects.

Longstaff,"We study the nature of systemic sovereign credit risk using CDS spreads for the U.S. Treasury, individual U.S. states, and major European countries. Using a multifactor affine framework that allows for both systemic and sovereign-specific credit shocks, we find that there is considerable heterogeneity across U.S. and European issuers in their sensitivity to systemic risk. U.S. and Euro systemic shocks are highly correlated, but there is much less systemic risk among U.S. sovereigns than among European sovereigns. We also find that U.S. and European systemic sovereign risk is strongly related to financial market variables. These results provide strong support for the view that systemic sovereign risk has its roots in financial markets rather than in macroeconomic fundamentals.",,,,,Issuer; Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Financial market; Sovereign credit risk; Treasury; Monetary economics,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:16982,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:16982,,,3122593936,,0,,9,False,,,lens

There is an ongoing discussion on how network topology and capital buffer influence systemic risk. On the one hand, the network contagion literature tends to emphasize the influence of the network topology. On the other hand, policy works tend to discuss restrictions over the capital buffers of financial institutions. Systemic risk is usually a complex function of both risk drivers and thus isolating the contributive effects of each risk driver to systemic risk is not a trivial task. Our decomposition methodology identifies and isolates these effects. We apply our methodology to the global banking network and find that the network topology effect explains most of the systemic risk measure's volatility. Additionally, we show that the capital buffer effect explains the persistent reduction in systemic risk buildup with effects concentrated around the global financial crisis. Our results confirm the importance of both risk drivers to measuring systemic risk",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Microeconomics; Network topology; Financial networks; Financial crisis; Insolvency; Financial risk management; Economic capital; Financial risk,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcb/wpaper/448.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bcb:wpaper:448,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcb/wpaper/448.html,,,2590118196,,0,012-375-232-998-372; 020-094-423-132-132; 025-303-272-106-219; 055-849-644-282-057; 077-436-811-650-375; 117-012-999-199-175; 135-027-341-094-865,0,False,,,lens

It will be appropriate to build CCP system on a solid legal base in order to ensure that the financial markets are not adversely affected during periods of economic crisis, or to keep the losses at a minimum level. For this reason, it is important to determine the legal nature of the CCP membership agreement and the legal basis of the relationship of that agreement. In case of active use of the CCP system, both time and money will be saved for banks and investment institutions that are members of the system, and systemic risk can be prevented. In other words, lack of explicitly determining the clearing rules for the system can cause loss of time (especially when the case file is submitted to the experts, etc.) and loss of money (the need for expert opinion, etc.), especially if the matter is submitted to the judiciary. Thanks to an efficient CCP implementation, it is possible to control the counterparty credit risk by increasing the confidence in the markets and thus to decrease the systemic risk.

Newman,"Epidemiologic studies illustrate that PAD is a very common finding when screening is performed in older adults. The outcomes in those with PAD in population studies reflect and extend the findings from clinical studies of PAD, confirming that older adults with PAD are disabled and have a high risk for CVD and total mortality. With the aging of the population, the prevalence of PAD is increasing. It is common in both men and women and increases in prevalence with age, such that at least 12% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older will have significant disease on noninvasive testing, most without classic intermittent claudication. Furthermore, PAD is strongly related to other manifestations of CVD and its risk factors. Those with PAD identified in epidemiologic studies have a two- to three-fold risk in CVD morbidity and mortality. Current treatment goals for PAD patients include improving function, primarily using exercise and medical therapy, and reduction of systemic risk and can be extended to those identified by screening. In addition, PAD must be thought of as a marker of advanced systemic atherosclerosis. Inasmuch as the risk of CVD and mortality in those with PAD is similar to those with a history of MI or stroke, those with PAD can be approached with the same measures for secondary CVD prevention as recommended for MI and stroke survivors. A simple bedside measure of the AAI can be used to improve the detection of PAD in clinical practice. Although there is no study that shows directly that screening and preventive treatment will reduce complications of PAD, a preventive approach in PAD patients is likely to improve overall survival, reduce MI, and will, perhaps, also reduce the risk of disabling leg pain and amputation. Future descriptions of the natural history of PAD in ongoing cohort studies may indicate that this is already beginning to occur.",48,9,1157,1162,Epidemiology; Internal medicine; Surgery; Cohort study; Amputation; Disease; Intermittent claudication; Population; Mass screening; Stroke; Medicine,,"Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arterial Occlusive Diseases/diagnosis; Arteriosclerosis/complications; Disabled Persons/statistics & numerical data; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening/methods; Peripheral Vascular Diseases/diagnosis; Prevalence; Primary Prevention/methods; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution",,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2000.tb04795.x/full https://europepmc.org/article/MED/10983919 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10983919 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10983919/ https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2000.tb04795.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2000.tb04795.x,10983919,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2000.tb04795.x,1493384373,,0,000-924-796-527-801; 001-001-682-919-365; 002-040-194-181-945; 005-407-561-818-299; 005-768-006-407-881; 006-864-571-290-141; 008-380-461-141-219; 010-550-175-000-360; 011-969-035-733-713; 014-714-996-553-062; 019-060-576-368-452; 021-848-220-447-323; 022-055-805-103-442; 022-828-102-052-812; 023-271-496-699-942; 024-940-399-142-87X; 025-994-021-208-451; 026-341-960-665-763; 027-298-901-722-778; 028-120-435-604-966; 028-279-618-591-170; 028-335-410-949-069; 028-456-862-798-266; 034-092-559-320-377; 034-654-162-396-21X; 037-097-019-207-535; 037-100-721-460-906; 044-678-132-339-483; 046-173-910-848-508; 047-454-600-156-116; 049-149-749-195-529; 049-512-104-577-726; 050-551-875-357-788; 051-396-405-613-811; 051-817-030-777-774; 057-746-381-250-002; 058-157-986-374-316; 059-244-965-146-391; 063-964-314-388-661; 064-289-856-506-714; 064-787-770-438-900; 065-956-727-802-886; 067-428-231-586-052; 073-816-615-646-300; 075-466-476-865-137; 075-628-806-644-679; 080-180-258-639-091; 080-354-490-591-94X; 080-434-168-006-239; 086-358-763-510-559; 089-891-599-693-633; 091-985-647-126-895; 093-279-537-370-349; 095-284-800-929-744; 097-004-630-564-132; 097-230-236-599-121; 101-288-877-463-501; 113-253-844-215-814; 138-799-891-332-353; 143-653-735-329-282; 165-919-795-370-918,61,False,,,lens

An Analysis of One of the Core Objectives of Securities Regulation,2017-04-27,2017.0,journal article,William & Mary Business Law Review,,,,Janet Austin,"One of the main objectives of securities regulation around the world is to protect the integrity or fairness of the markets. This, together with protecting investors, improving the efficiency of markets and protecting the markets from systemic risk, now form the four fundamental goals of securities regulation. However, what exactly is envisaged by this concept of market integrity or fairness? Are these simply norms of behaviour incapable of further definition? Despite their importance relatively little attention has been given to these concepts in the literature. Do they, for example, require securities regulators to just work towards eliminating dishonest trading practices such as market manipulation and insider trading? Or should regulators be required to go further and ensure, for example, transparency of corporate information, transparency of price information and equality of access to the markets? Examining what is encompassed by the objectives of protecting market integrity and fairness is critical for a number of reasons. First, if they are only normative concepts, they may be incapable of measurement. This is problematic because it may then be impossible to assess the progress of securities regulators towards achieving these goals. In addition, if they are in fact incapable of further definition and measurement, innovations which improve market efficiency, another key goal of securities regulation, are likely to be permitted even if the innovation in question actually detracts from the fairness or integrity of the market. This is because improvements in market efficiency are generally quantifiable and therefore measured improvements in market efficiency create the momentum for them to be permitted. This article seeks to analyse the concepts of market integrity and market fairness. It examines how they became one of the core goals of securities regulation around the world. The article then attempts to break down these concepts and provide further definition of them. It is hoped that this analysis will encourage the development of metrics to assess securities regulators’ performance and also allow the assessment of whether or not new market innovations should be adopted.",8,2,215,,Business ethics; Business; Systemic risk; Core (game theory); Transparency (market); Market manipulation; Insider trading; Industrial organization; Normative; Momentum (finance),,,,,https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1126&context=wmblr https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmblr/vol8/iss2/2/,https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmblr/vol8/iss2/2/,,,3122389016,,0,,2,False,,,lens

The risk of having and/or developing DR is influenced by many systemic features. Identification and management of particular systemic risk factors as early as possible during the course of DM might lower incidence of further progression and severity of DR. The aim of this study is to describe the correlation between systemic risk factors and DR in patients with DM in Cicendo National Eye Hospital on December 1st 2017 – January 31st 2018.; Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study. The subjects were all patients diagnosed with DR based on ophthalmology examination at outpatient clinic of Vitreoretinal Division in Cicendo National Eye Hospital. The data were analyzed using chi-square (x2) with significances of p < 0.05.; Result: Seventy-one eyes were included in this study, among of which has been classified as mild NPDR (n= 1), moderate NPDR (n= 9), severe NPDR (n= 27), and PDR (n= 34). Severe NPDR group had older age distribution at range 51-60 years old (n= 18, 66.7%, p = 0.001). Stage 1 hypertension was found to be dominant in PDR group (n= 18, 66.7%, p = 0.043). Both high total serum cholesterol group (n= 27, 76.5%, p = 0.048) and high fasting blood glucose (n= 27, 79.4%, p = 0.01) were significantly present in patients with PDR. Positive (+1) urine glucose was statistically significant in PDR group.; Conclusion: There were several systemic risk factors from laboratory findings correlated in patient with DR in this study, however further study is needed to determine their role for predicting progression and severity of DR.",1,2,,,Correlation; Internal medicine; Stage (cooking); Diabetic retinopathy; Visual impairment; Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; In patient; Outpatient clinic; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,,,,,https://www.ijretina.com/index.php/ijretina/article/download/40/17 https://ijretina.com/index.php/ijretina/article/view/40,https://ijretina.com/index.php/ijretina/article/view/40,,,2895928934,,0,014-014-516-930-344; 024-168-885-701-656; 039-445-811-884-135; 046-079-897-558-459; 050-068-324-545-432; 086-854-989-411-644; 095-352-027-564-400; 112-496-112-944-114; 130-262-731-474-757; 196-634-975-424-747,0,False,,,lens

Malz,"This paper describes a set of indicators of systemic risk computed from current market prices of equity and equity index options. It displays results from a prototype version, computed daily from January 2006 to January 2013. The indicators represent a systemic risk event as the realization of an extreme loss on a portfolio of large-intermediary equities. The technique for computing them combines risk-neutral return distributions with implied return correlations drawn from option prices, tying together the single-firm return distributions via a copula to simulate the joint distribution and thus the financial-sector portfolio return distribution. The indicators can be computed daily using only current market prices; no historical data are involved. They are therefore forward-looking and can exploit all the information impounded in current prices. However, the indicators blend both market expectations and the market's desire to protect itself against volatility and tail risk, so they cannot be readily decomposed into these two elements. The paper presents evidence that the indicators have some predictive power for systemic risk events and that they can serve as a meaningful market-adjusted point of comparison for fundamentals-based systemic risk indicators.",,,,,Rate of return on a portfolio; Copula (probability theory); Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Valuation of options; Tail risk; Portfolio; Risk neutral; Index (economics),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/607.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/607.html,,,3126088007,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Philip Davis; Ian Hurst; Iana Liadze; Rebecca Piggott; James Warren,"In this paper we incorporate a macroprudential policy model within a semi-structural global macroeconomic model, NiGEM. The existing NiGEM model is expanded for the UK, Germany and Italy to include two macroprudential tools: loan-to-value ratios on mortgage lending and variable bank capital adequacy targets. The former has an effect on the economy via its impact on the housing market while the latter acts on the lending spreads of corporate and households. A systemic risk index that tracks the likelihood of the occurrence of a banking crisis is modelled to establish thresholds at which macroprudential policies should be activated by the authorities. We then show counterfactual scenarios, including a historic dynamic simulation of the subprime crisis and the endogenous response of policy thereto, based on the macroprudential block as well as performing a cost-benefit analysis of macroprudential policies. Conclusions are drawn relating to use of this tool for prediction and policy analysis, as well as some of the limitations and potential further research.",,,,,Counterfactual thinking; Policy analysis; Systemic risk; Economics; Variable (computer science); Index (economics); Bank capital; Subprime crisis; Monetary economics; Macroeconomic model,,,,,https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:nsr:niesrd:490 https://ideas.repec.org/p/nsr/niesrd/490.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:nsr:niesrd:490,https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:nsr:niesrd:490,,,2800080937,,0,002-063-481-651-382; 029-754-943-615-152; 052-505-577-198-067; 068-117-445-408-751; 075-791-594-919-350; 082-052-442-671-581; 088-243-392-110-662; 097-352-194-138-508; 121-530-604-193-41X; 122-672-870-866-234; 131-235-307-528-886; 133-457-607-279-013; 140-192-503-616-065; 143-593-917-281-927; 174-607-705-851-827,5,False,,,lens

Although the link between this catastrophic disease and very high mortality is well recognized, even after undergoing emergent revascularization, the systemic risk stratification and long-term outcome are currently unclear. The clinical presentation, parameter-related in-hospital death and long-term outcomes of these patients with acute LMCA obstruction undergoing emergency revascularization were carefully reviewed. Methods and Results From January 2000 through December 2007, 1,588 patients were diagnosed to have STEMI and received emergent cardiac catheterization. The 38 (2.4%) of these 1,588 patients were enrolled into the present study due to LMCA obstruction. The analytical results identified the 30-day mortality rate as 42.1% (16/38). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that renal insufficiency was independently predictive of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR): 5.642; p=0.029), whereas successful revascularization was independently predictive of freedom from in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.174; p=0.044). The cut-off value of a Parsonnet score >20 was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (p=0.002). Conclusions Even undergoing emergency revascularization for patients with acute LMCA obstruction, the in-hospital mortality remains very high. Additionally, the worse clinical outcome was observed in those with renal insufficiency and Parsonnet score of >20.

058-215-680-106-389,On dependence consistency of CoVaR and some other systemic risk measures,2012-08-01,2012.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Georg Mainik; Eric Schaanning,"This paper is dedicated to the consistency of systemic risk measures with respect to stochastic dependence. It compares two alternative notions of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) available in the current literature. These notions are both based on the conditional distribution of a random variable Y given a stress event for a random variable X, but they use different types of stress events. We derive representations of these alternative CoVaR notions in terms of copulas, study their general dependence consistency and compare their performance in several stochastic models. Our central finding is that conditioning on X>=VaR_\alpha(X) gives a much better response to dependence between X and Y than conditioning on X=VaR_\alpha(X). We prove general results that relate the dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning on X>=VaR_\alpha(X) to well established results on concordance ordering of multivariate distributions or their copulas. These results also apply to some other systemic risk measures, such as the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and the Systemic Impact Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR based on the stress event X=VaR_\alpha(X) is not dependence consistent. In particular, if (X,Y) is bivariate normal, then CoVaR based on X=VaR_\alpha(X) is not an increasing function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues arise in the bivariate t model and in the model with t margins and a Gumbel copula. In all these cases, CoVaR based on X>=VaR_\alpha(X) is an increasing function of the dependence parameter.",,,,,Statistics; Consistency (statistics); Random variable; Gumbel distribution; Copula (linguistics); Multivariate normal distribution; Mathematics; Conditional probability distribution; Expected shortfall; Bivariate analysis,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1207.3464.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1207.3464,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1207.3464.html,,,3122503986,,0,,3,False,,,lens

195-286-148-487-627,Systemic Risk in Emerging Markets Financial Systems,,2002.0,,,,,,Stefan Wredenborg,"This paper gives an overview of the concept of systemic risk in emerging markets, focusing from the risks arising when companies raise capital internationally. When companies become active on the international arena and especially in emerging markets, more considerations have to be taken into account before a sound investment decision can be made. Recent crises in Mexico, Asia and Russia have shown that financial turmoil can spread between markets and create substantial jitters. The paper surveys the existing literature regarding systemic risk events in the above mentioned crises. The conclusions are that spillover effects have been present in all crises. The latter part of the paper consists of a correlation exercise between Argentina and 11 other emerging markets during the period of turmoil in Argentina in 2001. The conclusion is that minor contagious events can be traced from the Argentine crisis to the selected emerging markets. Some co-movements during the first half of 2001 can be interpreted as spillover effects, while the latter part of 2001 show muted effects, probably as a result of that investors and analysts differentiated between Argentina and other emerging markets during this period.",,,,,Emerging markets; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Investment (macroeconomics); Spillover effect; Financial system; Cost of capital; Capital (economics),,,,,https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1343589/file/2433195.pdf https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/1343589 https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/1343589,https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/1343589,,,1698493733,,0,,0,False,,,lens
102-536-405-280-519,Information Gaps and Shadow Banking,,2017.0,journal article,Virginia Law Review,00426601,University of Virginia,United States,Kathryn Judge,"This article argues that information gaps — pockets of information that are pertinent and knowable but not currently known — are a byproduct of shadow banking and a meaningful source of systemic risk. It lays the foundation for this claim by juxtaposing the regulatory regime governing the shadow banking system with the incentives of the market participants who populate that system. Like banks, shadow banks rely heavily on short-term debt claims designed to obviate the need for the holder to engage in any meaningful information gathering and analysis. The securities laws that prevail in the capital markets, however, both presume and depend on providers of capital playing the lead role performing these functions. In synthesizing insights from diverse bodies of literature and situating those understandings against the regulatory architecture, this article provides one of the first comprehensive accounts of how the information-related incentives of equity and money claimants explain many core features of both securities and banking regulation.The article’s main theoretical contribution is to provide a new explanation for the inherent fragility of institutional arrangements that rely on money claims. The literature on bank runs typically focuses on either coordination problems among depositors or information asymmetries between depositors and bank managers to explain bank runs. This article provides a third explanation, one which complements the established paradigms. It shows how information gaps increase the probability of panic by increasing the range of signals that can cast doubt on whether short-term debt that market participants had been treading like money remain sufficiently information insensitive to merit such treatment. It further examines how information gaps also impede the market and regulatory responses required to dampen the effects of a shock once panic takes hold. Evidence from the 2007-2009 financial crisis is consistent both with the article’s claims regarding the ways shadow banking creates information gaps and how those gaps contribute to fragility.",103,,411,,Shadow (psychology); Debt; Information asymmetry; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Money market; Shadow banking system; Monetary economics; Bank run,,,,,https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=faculty_scholarship https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/967/,https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/967/,,,2999060733,,0,,3,False,,,lens
196-648-961-030-605,REGULATION OF BANKING AND FINANCIAL MARKETS,2011-05-01,2011.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Alessio M. Pacces; Dirk Heremans,"textabstractAbstract: This paper is one chapter of the volume “Regulation and Economics” of the second edition of the Encyclopedia of Law and Economics.; The authors review the economics of banking and financial markets and the regulatory response to market failure. Market failure in finance depends on problems of information and externalities. Regulation addresses these problems through conduct of business rules and prudential requirements. This approach has recently proved insufficient to prevent financial crises. Governments and central banks had to step in with massive safety nets in order to prevent financial meltdown. Although the appropriate regulatory response to the global financial crisis is still to be discovered, this chapter tries to draw a few lessons for financial regulation and supervision.; ; First, prudential regulation and supervision should monitor, and possibly limit, competition between banks and non-banks in order to identify timely new sources of systemic risk. Second, financial stability policies need to strike a difficult balance between ex-ante strictness and ex-post leniency in order to deal with non-quantifiable risks. Moral hazard is not the only determinants of systemic instability; knightian uncertainty also determines instability by suddenly curtailing market and funding liquidity. Third, all financial institutions falling within the regulatory perimeter should have good corporate governance. However, what is good governance for non-financial firms is not necessarily efficient for financial firms due to the quality and quantity of externalities involved. Finally, because systemic externalities are cross-jurisdictional in modern financial markets, at least coordination among monetary and supervisory authorities of different countries is warranted.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Market failure; Order (exchange); Financial market; Financial crisis; Moral hazard; Corporate governance; Financial regulation; Financial system,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/85918006 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A34943 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2952334_code343537.pdf?abstractid=1914461&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1914461 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1914461_code343537.pdf?abstractid=1914461&mirid=1 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/82326 http://encyclo.findlaw.com/5850book.pdf,https://core.ac.uk/display/85918006,,,2104620721,,0,000-602-284-457-246; 000-758-639-759-712; 002-619-079-418-436; 002-924-289-573-339; 002-959-526-743-646; 003-960-390-861-25X; 009-288-554-274-306; 009-289-795-489-417; 010-753-010-745-591; 010-848-753-342-402; 012-276-745-856-456; 012-510-226-149-525; 012-965-386-840-746; 013-352-460-529-492; 013-656-139-176-101; 014-033-040-371-279; 015-297-164-206-182; 015-808-574-580-208; 016-370-313-049-569; 016-638-061-021-846; 017-434-862-302-463; 018-060-273-689-690; 018-092-696-854-025; 020-607-084-410-185; 020-693-900-318-664; 024-950-490-451-840; 025-406-570-223-810; 026-493-472-252-516; 026-764-695-219-678; 028-018-797-774-566; 028-536-800-410-836; 029-223-300-556-395; 033-066-972-536-635; 033-179-772-514-758; 035-002-500-157-952; 035-762-336-739-564; 037-859-815-544-186; 039-081-890-423-26X; 039-608-183-338-881; 040-909-191-052-853; 041-102-061-726-169; 041-357-825-052-331; 041-834-804-603-447; 045-578-946-379-167; 045-591-107-420-436; 047-536-563-383-262; 047-628-138-770-200; 047-740-773-511-670; 048-582-488-165-129; 049-729-744-089-517; 050-252-793-658-157; 050-388-960-986-08X; 051-083-017-713-880; 051-177-666-104-943; 051-777-747-571-884; 052-666-607-504-043; 054-258-971-981-866; 057-295-442-163-595; 057-478-589-163-292; 058-721-787-933-116; 058-944-461-448-602; 060-282-548-618-223; 061-507-857-940-217; 061-530-740-252-862; 061-575-796-914-756; 061-718-978-577-274; 062-341-603-053-318; 063-612-602-749-741; 064-082-659-998-467; 066-048-577-764-046; 068-089-570-561-91X; 069-962-617-997-13X; 071-201-416-864-993; 071-425-772-005-59X; 072-737-314-536-421; 073-102-671-993-062; 074-091-936-242-877; 074-520-759-614-571; 074-752-475-495-497; 077-493-557-839-658; 078-474-329-066-545; 079-208-171-687-96X; 079-743-252-616-914; 080-037-944-000-798; 080-521-957-882-296; 081-649-237-454-604; 083-646-648-085-97X; 087-980-696-269-342; 094-500-374-924-015; 095-014-653-078-766; 096-103-813-826-702; 096-837-208-147-587; 099-156-009-715-882; 101-517-004-064-735; 105-183-546-000-515; 106-819-330-302-378; 107-573-510-793-636; 107-715-005-239-504; 110-226-793-159-134; 112-087-998-502-763; 114-203-690-155-660; 115-280-835-040-385; 115-483-985-675-167; 118-288-349-132-239; 119-684-350-837-843; 120-232-452-236-828; 121-781-066-966-249; 122-875-806-717-55X; 132-256-253-063-989; 134-216-605-350-508; 142-393-180-679-400; 145-187-439-330-85X; 158-224-273-390-183; 159-172-143-862-44X; 168-436-839-903-10X; 170-061-614-551-362; 179-808-471-086-108; 181-620-575-827-81X; 182-401-964-998-619; 182-555-737-850-130; 182-726-716-644-85X; 191-907-892-986-065; 194-607-324-794-844,9,False,,,lens

We deal with both deviation measures and coherent risk measures and provide general mathematical methods applying to optimize them all. Numerical examples are given in order to illustrate how efficiently the non-systemic risk can be diversified and how effective the presented mathematical tools may be. It is also illustrated how the existence of huge disasters may lead to wrong solutions of our optimal risk sharing problem, in the sense that the involved risk measure could ignore the existence of a non-null probability of ""global ruin"" after the design of the optimal risk sharing strategy. To overcome this caveat, one can use more conservative risk measures. The stability in the large of the optimal sharing plan guarantees that ""the global ruin caveat"" may be also addressed and solved with the presented methods.",1,2,45,56,Risk analysis (engineering); Stability (learning theory); Time consistency; Business; Systemic risk; Risk management tools; Actuarial science; Reinsurance; Order (exchange); Risk measure; Risk sharing,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/1/2/45 https://doaj.org/article/c5c3f466f9ed4610821293b1a6903156 https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/103612/1/771009844.pdf https://eprints.ucm.es/id/eprint/63228/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jrisks/v1y2013i2p45-56d27724.html https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/103612 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:gam:jrisks:v:1:y:2013:i:2:p:45-56:d:27724 https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/1/2/45/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/362660807.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/risks1020045,,10.3390/risks1020045,2166997557,,0,008-653-550-832-565; 020-375-963-347-063; 023-600-672-255-422; 030-975-432-711-905; 034-056-017-641-426; 043-820-059-829-598; 044-631-469-627-263; 045-555-452-940-354; 052-229-761-943-698; 054-185-625-892-348; 054-655-990-076-182; 068-926-087-240-142; 077-547-070-878-787; 084-097-682-935-330; 088-652-893-008-84X; 132-439-335-203-350; 138-628-015-419-954; 139-148-899-760-907; 153-208-910-882-622; 163-162-282-069-260; 185-195-633-508-51X,3,True,cc-by,gold,lens

A Literature Review,2018-12-01,2018.0,journal article,Review of Economics,2366035x; 09485139,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,,Nils Moch,"Against the background of the global financial crisis, we review recent literature on the debate about “too big to fail”. This is (still) one of the key issues in banking literature since it determines the conditions for adequate banking regulation, financial stability and economic welfare. Analyzing 30 papers from 2009 to 2017, our work focusses on the impact of large banks on systemic risk. Large financial institutions can affect systemic risk by either contributing to systemic risk or being extremely exposed to sources of systematic risk and contagion. We find a considerable number of theoretical and empirical studies providing evidence that against the background of the constitution of present-day real financial systems, bank size is a key predictor for systemic risk and that the largest banks disproportionately contribute to overall risk. This relationship is found in samples of different composition, for various periods and with different measures covering diverse aspects of systemic risk.",69,3,231,257,Empirical research; Business; Systemic risk; Work (electrical); Constitution; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Affect (psychology); Financial system; Systematic risk,,,,,http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/roe.2018.69.issue-3/roe-2018-0011/roe-2018-0011.xml https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:lus:reveco:v:69:y:2018:i:3:p:231-257:n:3 https://ideas.repec.org/a/lus/reveco/v69y2018i3p231-257n3.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/roe-2018-0011,,10.1515/roe-2018-0011,2902371045,,0,001-482-621-175-438; 002-384-345-237-15X; 002-856-834-652-090; 003-798-307-381-667; 006-208-739-734-434; 009-914-431-903-235; 012-749-481-308-970; 012-925-826-648-197; 014-513-763-463-25X; 016-434-257-654-499; 018-168-475-223-121; 019-888-763-047-996; 021-004-268-095-013; 022-358-408-158-616; 024-538-068-782-439; 024-828-296-919-906; 025-023-867-651-148; 025-599-126-786-346; 026-037-581-724-894; 027-414-671-177-908; 038-671-854-155-636; 038-693-407-049-222; 038-730-214-794-381; 040-545-560-326-908; 041-093-748-297-354; 041-786-210-324-199; 043-040-723-399-374; 047-750-569-332-017; 047-962-708-666-901; 050-449-945-008-057; 052-854-720-387-553; 054-368-148-072-436; 054-802-901-465-782; 056-084-592-994-224; 056-961-761-959-748; 057-774-599-082-767; 058-770-513-154-60X; 060-437-397-127-606; 067-566-243-166-202; 069-656-379-291-24X; 070-903-956-191-670; 073-964-863-932-546; 074-570-851-796-887; 083-508-652-775-775; 084-090-075-592-338; 085-072-484-857-963; 085-625-375-164-137; 086-816-656-608-222; 090-021-715-677-021; 094-299-996-884-482; 094-936-582-757-810; 097-904-289-653-054; 098-538-467-007-995; 099-004-422-306-174; 100-870-477-519-278; 103-100-136-851-609; 104-058-318-340-973; 106-714-850-007-793; 110-839-318-469-960; 111-130-112-502-065; 115-363-703-990-948; 115-806-665-215-624; 116-327-783-464-857; 116-431-610-698-356; 117-012-999-199-175; 117-903-132-807-368; 120-508-699-672-087; 122-102-443-580-78X; 122-779-428-131-390; 123-869-721-354-88X; 128-130-470-320-613; 128-290-174-630-53X; 136-139-004-838-117; 139-025-166-443-808; 142-111-291-120-775; 143-459-724-597-290; 144-780-567-853-461; 153-779-195-390-459; 158-086-367-812-84X; 161-388-814-416-825; 161-889-520-637-812; 167-308-406-092-02X; 169-124-115-210-264; 184-114-784-268-660; 197-158-784-937-381,3,True,,bronze,lens

Sasidevan; Nils Bertschinger,"The latest financial crisis has painfully revealed the dangers arising from a globally interconnected financial system. Conventional approaches based on the notion of the existence of equilibrium and those which rely on statistical forecasting have seen to be inadequate to describe financial systems in any reasonable way. A more natural approach is to treat financial systems as complex networks of claims and obligations between various financial institutions present in an economy. The generic framework of complex networks has been successfully applied across several disciplines, e.g., explaining cascading failures in power transmission systems and epidemic spreading. Here we review various network models addressing financial contagion via direct inter-bank contracts and indirectly via overlapping portfolios of financial institutions. In particular, we discuss the implications of the ""robust-yet-fragile"" nature of financial networks for cost-effective regulation of systemic risk.",,,,,Cascading failure; Business; Systemic risk; Financial networks; Financial crisis; Financial contagion; Walling; Complex network; Financial system; Power transmission,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1912.05273.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1912.05273.html,,,3166069650,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Based on information entropy and the balance sheet data of 167 banks from 2011 to 2020, we proposed a centrality indicator based on Adjacency Information Entropy, then applied it to directed weighted and directed unweighted interbank networks to identify banks with systemically important status, and compared the results with those of traditional centrality indicators. The outcomes show that the results of centrality indicator based on Adjacency Information Entropy are more accurate than those of traditional centrality indicators in identifying banks with systemically important status in interbank networks. Six large state-owned commercial banks, nine joint-stock commercial banks, two policy banks, and two urban commercial banks with large assets are identified as systemically important banks based on the proposed centrality indicator, which is highly consistent with the list of systemically important banks published by the Chinese banking regulator. Among the systemically important banks, changes in systemic risk levels of joint-stock commercial banks and urban commercial banks are more susceptible to national policies than those of large state-owned commercial banks. The findings of this paper have certain reference significance for strengthening the supervision of banks with systemically important status in interbank networks and formulating targeted policies for regulating large commercial banks and small- and medium-sized commercial banks.</jats:p>",2022,,1,12,Centrality; Systemic risk; Business; Stock (firearms); Adjacency list; Entropy (arrow of time); China; Actuarial science; Computer science; Economics; Financial crisis; Statistics; Mathematics; Geography; Physics; Archaeology; Algorithm; Quantum mechanics; Macroeconomics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6979176,,10.1155/2022/6979176,,,0,001-266-037-709-342; 001-935-667-357-797; 002-318-642-471-254; 006-419-704-721-393; 006-654-454-132-907; 007-238-929-799-224; 010-423-042-177-734; 017-397-143-872-611; 032-399-073-504-241; 034-350-220-562-149; 041-214-423-569-209; 061-640-308-592-830; 069-214-907-334-007; 096-886-016-264-499; 108-148-764-535-484; 115-806-665-215-624; 118-113-658-658-483; 128-690-780-207-865; 153-779-195-390-459,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

As trade repository data become more comprehensively available to authorities, the same measures could be applied more broadly. We consider the importance of market participants both to the smooth functioning of derivatives markets and in terms of their potential contribution to financial distress. In relation to market functioning, we study some measures that take into account only immediate counterparty positions and others that consider the whole counterparty network of positions. In some cases, the network of positions beyond immediate counterparties makes a significant difference to the rank ordering of the systemic importance of institutions. This means it is important for authorities responsible for financial stability to have access to data beyond the counterparty positions of institutions in their own jurisdictions. In relation to financial distress, we highlight the importance of identifying institutions which may contribute to liquidity strains, as increasing collateralisation of counterparty exposures will diminish credit risk but could at times sharply raise demand for liquid assets to post as collateral.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Collateral; Trade Repository; Counterparty; Sample (statistics); Financial system; Derivatives market,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:boe:finsta:0038,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:boe:finsta:0038,,,3121356498,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Demidova,"<jats:p>Government interference in the social-economic processes through the implementation of anti-crisis measures and fiscal expansion holds the embodiment of financial risks for economic entities. As a result, government debt and budget gaps at the continuing drop of real disposable household income and companies’ profitability grow. Over a long-term horizon, the decisions made can cause a financial system misbalance and new risk generation, including systemic risks in the sphere of public finance. The author carries out the theoretical research of financial system risks, which can result in a decrease in the system stability in general. The study determines that there is no single theoretical concept of financial risks of the public sector. Within the research, the author analyzed the approaches to systemic risks in various economic sectors and decomposed systemic risk of the public finance sphere. The study specified global factors of influence on the financial system stability, determined the impact factors and common fiscal limitations considering the needs in the execution of state obligations. The pandemic factor – COVID-19 spread is highlighted as an exogenous factor of impact on the formation of financial system misbalances. The main threat to the financial system stability considered in terms of the functional-institutional approach is the deficiency of economic entities’ liquidity. Unprecedented budgetary measures of anti-crisis financial regulation, the deferred impact – tax preferences, and monetary measures had an immediate influence on the liquidity volume during the implementation of anti-COVID activities. Tools of budgetary monitoring, budget expenditures reviews, tax expenditures reviews, and budget consolidation ensure the budget mechanism flexibility. Factors producing financial system risks and the selected measures of state regulation will set the trends for the social-economic development of the country in the coming years.</jats:p>",,,13,21,Business; Financial system,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.18323/2221-5689-2021-1-13-21,http://dx.doi.org/10.18323/2221-5689-2021-1-13-21,,10.18323/2221-5689-2021-1-13-21,3150352905,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The recent crisis has shown, on the one hand, that financial mitigations (i.e. capital requirements) are, per se, not sufficient to ensure the stability of the banks (which underpins the soundness of the entire financial system) and, on the other hand, the failure of the light-touch supervisory approach. The main research question is whether the improvement of ICG, involving proper protection for stakeholders and the switch to a more intrusive supervisory model, will be able to offset the failures of market discipline revealed by the crisis and, together with Basel 3’s reinforced capital adequacy regime, strengthen the resilience of the financial system, without the reintroduction of structural reforms. In the European Union, the new European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and, above all, the three new European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) will play a crucial role in this process.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Capital adequacy ratio; Financial crisis; Context (language use); Market discipline; Capital requirement; European union; Corporate governance; Financial system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mod/wcefin/0029.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mod/wcefin/0029.html,,,3125041742,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Kapstein,"Speaking in May 1998, in the shadow of an Asian financial crisis that was spreading globally, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus announced that “the leaders of the world want to embark on the design of a new (financial) architecture.” Reflecting the position that industrial world governments would formally adopt at their forthcoming G8 summit in England, he asserted that the new architecture must be built atop several cornerstones, including a commitment to financial sector openness, good governance, and greater economic transparency. In addition, he suggested that international financial markets required the continuing elaboration of multilateral standards, codes, and best practices if future crises were to be avoided (Camdessus 1998). It did not take long for skeptics of this G8 proposal to rear their heads; after all, grandiose phrases like “new financial architecture” naturally provoked them. In a speech before the World Affairs Council, for example, Berkeley professor and former US Treasury official J. Bradford DeLong stated that “there is no world-wide political consensus” with respect to the systemic risks facing the global economy and that, as a consequence, “dreams of a rebuilt, reformed, and renewed international financial architecture will remain nothing but dreams” (DeLong 1999). Beyond these skeptics lurked the critics who – whether coming from the left or the right of the political spectrum – curiously shared the conspiratorial view that the new international financial architecture represented nothing more than another underhanded attempt by governments and international organizations to bail out reckless banks at taxpayer expense.",,,113,152,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Position (finance); Financial crisis; Transparency (behavior); Good governance; Treasury; Financial regulation,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=891904 https://core.ac.uk/display/20968361 https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/past-and-future-of-central-bank-cooperation/architects-of-stability-international-cooperation-among-financial-supervisors/3CD67F00BE96A6888BF15ED0649C6EAD https://www.bis.org/publ/work199.htm http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BB14900816 https://www.bis.org/publ/work199.pdf https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/architects-of-stability-international-cooperation-among-financial,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511510779.004,,10.1017/cbo9780511510779.004,1547059042,,0,029-588-588-676-75X; 052-201-386-466-679; 065-920-366-420-342; 070-630-249-783-211; 070-785-501-675-383; 075-832-739-430-58X; 082-535-513-245-923,9,True,,green,lens

Specifically, we analyse the role of the bargaining power of financial intermediaries in promoting (or reducing) the entrance of new enterprises in the market and find that the financial sector is essential for the good functioning of the real economy, but that an overdeveloped financial industry can reduce the incentive for new firms to start production, resulting in a negative impact on aggregate growth and economic stability.",15,1,89,109,Financial services; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Incentive; Bargaining power; Monetary economics; Financial intermediary; Economic stability; Transaction cost,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-019-00270-5 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:jau:wpaper:2018/11 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jeicoo/v15y2020i1d10.1007_s11403-019-00270-5.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11403-019-00270-5,,10.1007/s11403-019-00270-5,2904728185,,0,001-909-558-708-747; 003-459-040-096-835; 004-053-853-849-490; 005-378-493-397-276; 010-097-735-261-516; 013-553-440-226-76X; 016-351-456-093-90X; 017-153-449-730-092; 017-667-912-281-929; 018-023-402-449-229; 018-536-276-834-233; 018-965-886-987-857; 022-746-790-855-379; 025-694-230-886-764; 035-354-226-933-283; 038-358-167-345-373; 040-801-336-012-314; 040-970-088-351-014; 041-779-180-462-965; 044-800-404-322-789; 045-444-446-427-472; 046-094-525-749-209; 046-845-154-724-305; 047-179-819-737-704; 056-648-790-370-122; 062-938-103-637-028; 065-679-854-548-849; 067-055-977-826-973; 067-743-252-299-95X; 071-815-396-570-520; 074-231-962-384-512; 074-602-718-129-405; 082-582-579-570-704; 083-927-773-139-165; 087-770-454-348-325; 090-288-881-416-129; 091-540-257-245-475; 098-794-473-171-663; 099-251-460-469-618; 101-506-920-391-64X; 108-070-519-218-998; 114-679-401-230-462; 118-535-013-211-668; 119-208-366-546-277; 119-357-906-025-00X; 121-069-979-111-756; 129-886-394-011-718; 136-829-927-859-029; 152-184-828-580-959; 169-321-653-076-421; 179-139-555-262-02X; 190-811-881-945-142; 192-344-151-541-94X; 199-036-819-127-715,3,False,,,lens

It is necessary to measure the change and character of financial risk and try to avoid the risk in terms of theory and practice. Based on the contingent claims analysis (CCA) framework, this paper tries to use higher-moment transformation to quantify the risk of financial distress better. The average distance to default under HCCA model of the Chinese banks fluctuated at low-level in recent years, the same goes for traditional average distance to default. And, more remarkable, the systematic distance to default under HCCA model and original normal distribution random model fluctuated at low-level too. These are signs that the systemic risks for the listed banks in China take on an increasing trend at the high level. HCCA model can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of financial policies, and strengthen the forward-looking prediction of policy measures.",2,3,,,Normal distribution; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Financial market; Financial distress; Random model; Moment (mathematics); Financial risk,,,,,https://francis-press.com/papers/735#abstract https://francis-press.com/uploads/papers/3mmEYVw0hqF5mdiKPDMRYab96Q8DaZc6HRDIwCOD.pdf,https://francis-press.com/papers/735#abstract,,,2979893463,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Gallardo-Quintilla; Tomas Tiu; Enrico Torres,"Bank closures happen globally due to legal grounds that vary among countries. The adverse effects common to all bank closures include loss of employment, disruptions in the payment and settlement system, loss of public confidence in the stability of the banking system, bank runs, systemic risks and losses imposed on uninsured depositors and other creditors. The researcher’s goals are the minimization of losses imposed on the uninsured depositors and other creditors and expeditious recoveries of their claims. Indicators of bank insolvency and their impact on the recoveries of creditors’ claims against the assets of closed banks under PDIC liquidation have been examined. Using the Pearson correlational analysis, findings reveal significant statistical link between the liabilities and realizable assets to recoveries of 577 closed banks as of yearend 2011. Findings also show that high debt ratios of 386 or 67% of the 577 closed banks indicated that their liabilities exceed the value of their realizable assets. Thus, these banks cannot pay all their debts, thereby, imposing losses on uninsured depositors and other creditors. To conclude, the researcher recommends that bank regulators should jointly prepare draft bills to be presented to the government legislative branch for reforms in the traditional bank closure practices and in the implementation of the liquidation processes that are detrimental to the best interest of uninsured depositors, creditors and the general public.",,,,,Debt; Debt ratio; Business; Systemic risk; Payment; Creditor; Actuarial science; Settlement (finance); Insolvency; Financial system; Bank run,,,,,http://www.ijsse.org/articles/ijsse_v1_i10_14_25.pdf,http://www.ijsse.org/articles/ijsse_v1_i10_14_25.pdf,,,2182497939,,0,003-408-059-251-276; 011-593-713-411-455; 024-983-085-824-317; 033-208-731-896-841; 035-392-148-765-428; 048-489-200-320-913; 056-452-430-967-190; 056-860-670-346-230; 071-418-614-303-174; 081-205-377-303-915; 085-860-667-275-912; 103-012-187-567-456; 121-530-604-193-41X; 197-252-711-891-272,0,False,,,lens

A Luxembourg empirical evaluation,2018-02-01,2018.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Xisong Jin,"In order to effciently capture the contribution to the aggregated systemic risk of each financial institution arising from various important balance-sheet items, this study proposes a comprehensive approach of “Mark-to-Systemic-Risk"" to integrate book value data of Luxembourg financial institutions into systemic risk measures. It first characterizes systemic risks and risk spillovers in equity returns for 33 Luxembourg banks, 30 European banking groups, and 232 investment funds.1 The forward-looking systemic risk measures delta CoES, Shapley – delta CoES, SRISK and conditional concentration risk are estimated by using a large-scale dynamic grouped t-copula, and their common components are determined by the generalized dynamic factor model. Several important facts are documented during 2009-2016: (1) Measured by delta CoES of equity returns, Luxembourg banks were more sensitive to the adverse events from investment funds compared to European banking groups, and investment funds were more sensitive to the adverse events from banking groups than from Luxembourg banks. (2) Ranked by Shapley - delta CoES values, money market funds had the highest marginal contribution to the total risk of Luxembourg banks while equity funds exhibited the least share of the risk, and the systemic risk contribution of bond funds, mixed funds and hedge funds became more important toward the end of 2016. (3) The macroeconomic determinants of the aggregate systemic risk of banking groups, Luxembourg banks and investment funds, and the marginal contributions from 15 countries to the aggregate systemic risk of Luxemburg banks and their parent banking groups are all different.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Concentration risk; Book value; Hedge fund; Equity (finance); Financial institution; Monetary economics; Bond; Value at risk,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcl/bclwop/bclwp118.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bcl:bclwop:bclwp118,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcl/bclwop/bclwp118.html,,,2899439652,,0,,1,False,,,lens

OA of the hip and knee are two of the most important causes of pain and physical disability in community-dwelling adults. Symptomatic hand OA is a common disease among the elderly, and impairs hand function, this impairment being largely mediated by pain. Like other chronic diseases, the etiology of OA is multifactorial, and several local and systemic risk factors have been identified. Differences in the prevalence of OA may be attributable to both genetic and life-style factors. Disease definition may be based upon clinical or radiographic criteria, although case definition should rely on radiographic features for epidemiological studies. This review focuses on the functional impact of the disease, describes geographic differences in prevalence rates, discusses disease definition criteria, and summarizes the most common risk factors, including age, associated with the risk of OA.",15,5,359,363,Epidemiology; Internal medicine; Etiology; Prevalence; Physical therapy; Osteoarthritis; Arthritis; Disease; MEDLINE; Physical disability; Medicine,,"Aged; Aging; Humans; Osteoarthritis, Hip/epidemiology; Osteoarthritis, Knee/epidemiology; Prevalence; Risk Factors",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14703001/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03327356 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14703001 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/14703001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf03327356,14703001,10.1007/bf03327356,1978285583,,1,000-970-449-992-634; 001-691-862-537-082; 001-699-787-654-129; 004-108-176-789-982; 004-463-214-867-491; 005-463-383-168-110; 005-467-774-218-785; 005-761-916-628-243; 005-796-434-489-025; 006-142-494-061-075; 011-058-406-286-944; 011-699-651-542-93X; 013-665-660-810-024; 014-342-215-985-758; 014-512-417-609-485; 015-067-657-997-062; 016-820-763-870-974; 019-131-812-347-668; 019-744-644-692-797; 019-801-429-304-382; 022-660-937-400-946; 022-825-761-662-40X; 025-019-821-555-693; 026-114-088-781-808; 028-048-011-922-350; 030-093-842-767-261; 031-271-785-553-958; 031-930-185-022-172; 034-743-553-744-95X; 036-693-286-609-410; 040-499-102-358-430; 040-649-140-444-023; 043-347-243-891-905; 044-166-102-778-195; 045-614-226-792-944; 046-275-853-776-874; 047-569-357-051-743; 047-969-594-602-329; 050-233-649-341-24X; 052-997-104-452-479; 055-776-264-175-474; 060-024-338-514-627; 060-111-568-792-53X; 066-442-137-653-620; 066-906-192-334-094; 067-802-839-320-129; 069-943-470-742-808; 069-953-004-034-301; 070-299-451-663-988; 070-800-314-960-042; 071-593-310-925-837; 071-682-915-188-918; 075-729-016-621-627; 082-460-681-177-356; 085-488-293-046-817; 089-312-356-027-784; 098-904-603-376-603; 101-005-472-890-836; 104-350-907-602-861; 106-843-882-845-215; 106-844-458-606-105; 120-198-866-626-192; 148-086-047-634-72X; 168-168-866-815-422; 189-444-395-734-22X,197,False,,,lens

Much efforts has been put to model the contagion dynamics of financial shocks, and to assess the resilience of specific financial markets---either using real data, reconstruction techniques or simple toy networks. Here we address the more general problem of how the shock propagation dynamics depends on the topological details of the underlying network. To this end, we consider different network topologies, all consistent with balance sheets information obtained from real data on financial institutions. In particular, we consider networks with varying density and mesoscale structures, and vary as well the details of the shock propagation dynamics. We show that the systemic risk properties of a financial network are extremely sensitive to its network features. Our results can thus aid in the design of regulatory policies to improve the robustness of financial markets.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Financial market; Network topology; Key (cryptography); Sensitivity (control systems); Resilience (network); Robustness (economics); Computer science,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1805.04325.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1805.04325,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1805.04325.html,,,3126085867,,0,,1,False,,,lens

For the empirical analysis, the authors use data related to bitcoin and widely traded asset classes. They also utilize the copula approach as well as the CoVaR model. The results show a significant role of crypto-asset market in the stability of global markets. Precisely, they find a dependence between bitcoin and oil prices defined by a normal copula model. The empirical results regarding the systemic risk show that extreme changes in bitcoin prices may have an adverse effect on equity and gold markets. There are positive and significant effects of EUR, JPY, and WTI markets when bitcoin goes down. The authors have also shown that after 2016 the virtual market sudden changes are more likely to raise the whole regular financial system losses, except the energy market.

Specifically, a decrease in a bank's equity capital results in substantially more violations of its self-reported risk levels in the following quarter. The under-reporting is especially high during the critical periods of high systemic risk and for banks with larger trading operations. We exploit a discontinuity in the expected benefit of under-reporting present in Basel regulations to provide further support for a causal link between capital-saving incentives and under-reporting.

Raj,"Introduction: Neural degeneration of the retina has been demonstrated in diabetes mellitus (DM). Several studies have focused on retinal neural function in diabetic retinopathy (DR) but few have assessed function in diabetic maculopathy, the leading cause of visual disturbance in DM. Aim: To correlate, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, central macular function to diabetic maculopathy. Methods: Treatment-naive subjects with DM were recruited to three groups: i) diabetic controls (no visible signs of DR); ii) early maculopathy (maculopathy not meeting criteria for clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO)); and iii) sight-threatening maculopathy (presence of CSMO and/or ischaemic maculopathy). A group of healthy controls was also recruited. Subjects underwent assessment of best correct visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), microperimetry (MP), multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), oscillatory potential (OP) and systemic risk factors (HbA1c, serum cholesterol and blood pressure). Subjects with DM were invited to follow-up at 6 months and 12 months where assessments were repeated. One-way ANOVA and ANCOVA were used for cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, respectively (SPSS, Version 22). Results: Eighty-nine subjects with DM (diabetic controls, n=24; early maculopathy, n=24; sight-threatening maculopathy, n=41) and 29 healthy controls were recruited. Compared to both healthy and diabetic controls, subjects with sight-threatening maculopathy showed significant worsening in CS (10-15% reduction, p 0.10 for all comparisons). Conclusions: Central macular function is reduced in diabetic maculopathy despite reasonable visual acuity. Assessment of neural function alongside clinical examination may provide the clinician with a clearer picture of central macular status and aid in clinical decision making.",,,,,Ophthalmology; Visual acuity; Microperimetry; Diabetic retinopathy; Maculopathy; Neural degeneration; Physical examination; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine; Blood pressure,,,,,https://doi.org/10.17638/03009729 https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.733800 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3009729/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/146487916.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17638/03009729,,10.17638/03009729,2788594097,,0,,0,True,,,lens

The former group of measures gauges the overall tension in the financial sector whereas second group relies on individual institution information to extract joint distress at portfolio level. We rank the measures using three criteria: i) Granger Causality tests, ii) Gonzalo and Granger metric, and iii) the correlation with an index of systemic events and policy actions. We find that the best systemic risk indicator based on aggregate market measures is the First Principal Component of a portfolio of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads whereas the best indicator based on individual institution’s measures is the Multivariate Densities computed from CDS spreads. These results suggest that the measures based on CDSs outperform measures based on interbank rates or stock market prices.

We show that the direct effects of UMPs are limited, indeed nil depending on the country, and are always weaker than their indirect effects. After having highlighted the heterogeneity of the indirect effects of UMPs in the eurozone, we offer diverse interpretations – macroeconomic, financial or banking differences, depending on the country – using a Panel Conditionally Homogenous VAR model (PCHVAR).

Leduc; Antonios Garas; Frank Schweitzer,"Abstract We study cascades on a two-layer multiplex network, with asymmetric feedback that depends on the coupling strength between the layers. Based on an analytical branching process approximation, we calculate the systemic risk measured by the final fraction of failed nodes on a reference layer. The results are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an aggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the two-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling strength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength, systemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in the two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size that are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied to a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into a less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases, this may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated in an aggregated approach.",323,,64,72,Fraction (mathematics); Topology; Systemic risk; Phase transition; Branching process; Layer (object-oriented design); Representation (systemics); Cascade; Computer science; Coupling (computer programming),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278915001943 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhyD..323...64B/abstract http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278915001943 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06664.pdf https://128.84.21.199/abs/1506.06664?context=physics.soc-ph https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06664 http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06664,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2015.10.004,,10.1016/j.physd.2015.10.004,1816403485,,0,001-803-881-052-869; 003-435-763-398-902; 006-208-739-734-434; 009-279-045-093-30X; 009-778-319-830-175; 010-527-108-493-219; 012-430-523-378-543; 014-787-197-581-46X; 025-303-272-106-219; 034-364-789-388-867; 034-970-236-164-193; 041-270-525-170-289; 041-753-054-402-608; 044-287-575-313-532; 049-619-218-197-510; 057-968-969-026-259; 058-879-947-933-394; 061-427-932-857-377; 064-120-679-762-739; 068-840-521-699-849; 081-991-429-666-197; 087-918-868-716-253; 087-971-138-937-428; 088-149-451-347-256; 097-156-997-880-564; 100-225-157-315-979; 105-065-966-248-499; 108-452-452-559-408; 111-261-068-794-338; 114-014-415-572-061; 117-012-999-199-175; 117-080-661-275-358; 121-423-763-457-589; 155-402-052-450-031; 160-755-169-351-728; 162-928-219-743-179; 165-120-715-977-510; 175-689-342-058-827,37,True,,green,lens

151-573-147-670-564,Too Many to Fail: Against Community Bank Deregulation,2020-11-15,2020.0,journal article,Northwestern University Law Review,00293571,University of Illinois Press,United States,Jeremy C. Kress; Matthew C. Turk,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and scholars have fixated on the problem of “too-big-to-fail” banks. This fixation, however, overlooks the historically dominant pattern in banking crises: the contemporaneous failure of many small institutions. We call this blind spot the “too-many-to-fail” problem and document how its neglect has skewed the past decade of financial regulation. In particular, we argue that, for so-called community banks, there has been a pronounced and unjustifiable shift toward deregulation, culminating in sweeping regulatory rollbacks in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018.; ; As this Article demonstrates, this deregulatory trend rests on three myths. First, that community banks do not contribute to systemic risk and were not central to the 2008 crisis. Second, that the Dodd-Frank Act imposed regulatory burdens that threaten the survival of the community bank sector. And third, that community banks cannot remain viable without special subsidies or regulatory advantages. While these claims have gained near-universal acceptance among legal scholars and policymakers, none of them withstands scrutiny. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, community banks were key participants in the 2008 crisis, were not uniquely burdened by post-crisis reforms, and continue to thrive economically. ; ; Dispelling these myths about the community bank sector leads to the conclusion that diligent oversight of community banks is necessary to preserve financial stability. Accordingly, this Article recommends a reversal of the community bank deregulatory trend and proposes affirmative reforms, including enhanced supervision and macro-prudential stress tests, that would help mitigate systemic risks in the community bank sector.",115,3,647,716,Economic policy; Business; Systemic risk; Law; Consumer Protection Act; Conventional wisdom; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Financial regulation; Deregulation; Subsidy,,,,,https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1442&context=nulr https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/nulr/vol115/iss3/1/,https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/nulr/vol115/iss3/1/,,,3124748085,,0,,0,False,,,lens
090-464-420-123-577,Role of the IMF in the Global Financial Crisis,2010-09-22,2010.0,,Cato Journal,02733072,Cato Institute,United States,Miranda Xafa,"More than two years on, the impact of the financial crisis that erupted in August 2007 is still being felt as the global economy emerges from the Great Recession. The crisis intensified dramatically after the bankruptcy of Lehman and the rescue of insurance giant AIG in September 2008, which narrowly avoided a near-simultaneous failure of multiple counterparties. The International Monetary Fund's early forecast of the severity of the resulting economic downturn (IMF 2008a) helped mobilize concerted official action to address quickly and forcefully these extraordinary economic and financial events by providing fiscal stimulus to sustain growth, as well as capital injections and guarantees to ease the credit crunch. Following the emergency summit of G20 leaders in Washington in November 2008, support packages for banks were put together in a hurry in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere to prevent the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions and to restore confidence in the financial system. These unprecedented interventions prevented a meltdown and contributed significantly to signs of economic and financial stabilization since the spring of 2009. In this article, I review the role of the IMF in the global crisis and argue that the Fund has emerged as a powerful institutional force, providing analysis and recommendations that have served as the basis of official action on several fronts. By contrast, the Fund was barking up the wrong tree when it focused its attention on the global imbalances and adopted the Surveillance Decision in the run-up to the crisis in 2006-07. IMF Policies and Reforms in Response to the Crisis The Fund helped shape the global policy response through its policy advice and spot-on analysis of global economic and financial conditions, contributing to the process of modernizing the global financial architecture. It was also quick to adapt its own surveillance activities and lending policies in response to the crisis. Lessons of the Crisis For IMF Surveillance The root cause of this crisis was the buildup of systemic risk due to regulatory and supervisory failure that was not adequately captured by the Fund's surveillance framework. The crisis has clearly demonstrated the need to improve the existing framework for assessing financial stability and to reinforce early warning capabilities in the advanced countries as well as globally. The global reach of the crisis also gave rise to calls for improved monitoring of cross-country spillover risks and their potential macroeconomic impact. At its October 2009 meeting, the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) recognized that a reassessment of the Fund's role was in order and called on the Fund to review its mandate ""to cover the full range of macroeconomic and financial sector policies that bear on global stability, and to report back to the Committee by the time of file next Annual Meetings"" in 2010 (IMFC, 2009a). At the Committee's request, the Fund distilled the initial lessons even as the crisis was still unfolding (IMF 2009a) and is in the process of revising its policies and governance accordingly. Global Financial Stability The Fund's Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR), published semiannually since 2003, assesses key risks facing the global financial system highlighting policies that can help mitigate systemic risks and enhance financial stability. In the Run-up to the crisis, the GFSR warned about rising credit and market risks associated with the growth in subprime mortgages embedded in complex, hard-to-price structured products (IMF 2006 and 2007a). Similarly, the World Economic Outlook (WEO) flagged some early concerns about the risks of house price bubbles in the United States and the dangers from large current account deficits in emerging Europe (IMF 2007b). However, the focus of this advice was not sharp enough to prompt policy action, and policymakers in the still-booming global economy were less receptive to the warnings. …",30,3,475,489,Business; Systemic risk; Credit crunch; Recession; Financial crisis; Global financial system; World Economic Outlook; Global imbalances; Corporate governance; Financial system,,,,,https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2010/11/cj30n3-5.pdf https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-250134281/role-of-the-imf-in-the-global-financial-crisis https://ideas.repec.org/a/cto/journl/v30y2010i3p475-489.html,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-250134281/role-of-the-imf-in-the-global-financial-crisis,,,3123884148,,0,011-409-172-531-08X; 011-581-997-941-934; 060-470-566-738-93X; 162-134-258-229-004; 194-188-572-689-759,12,False,,,lens

Conclusion Government is the people's business, and every man, woman and child becomes a shareholder with the first penny of tax paid. (1) In France in the 1980s, the socialists took over the banks. In the United States in the 2000s, the banks took over the government. (2) I. INTRODUCTION The world is still reeling from the aftershocks of the recent financial crisis. What started as a bursting U.S. real estate bubble in mid-2007 escalated into a full-blown systemic meltdown in global financial markets in 2008-09, followed by crippling recession and sovereign debt crisis in the world's leading economies in 2010-11. (3) The crisis demonstrated that, in today's complex and interconnected world, the process of financial innovation is not a matter of concern solely to financial market professionals. Risks generated by private market actors in pursuit of financial gain have serious and wide-ranging public implications. The ultimate cost of financial crises is inevitably borne by the taxpayers and the broader society, especially its least affluent members. In this context, making the financial system safer is increasingly a matter of direct public concern, which implicates democratic politics as much as technocratic administration. Theoretically, protecting the public from potentially devastating financial crises is the job of government agencies regulating and supervising the financial services sector. As the latest crisis demonstrated, financial regulators consistently failed to exercise truly public-minded and independent judgment with respect to potential systemic risks created by unfettered financial innovation and the industry's pursuit of private profit. In response to the crisis, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), the most sweeping financial regulation reform legislation since the Great Depression. (4) Yet, this voluminous new law falls short of correcting a critical flaw in the existing regulatory process: pervasive regulatory capture and lack of consistent representation of the public interest in long-term financial stability. Today, much like in the pre-crisis years, most substantive decisions in the area of systemic risk regulation are made behind closed doors, by industry insiders and agency technocrats. Is it possible to ensure meaningful public participation in the process of regulating systemic risk associated with financial innovation? …",37,3,621,,Economic policy; Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Regulatory capture; Financial innovation; Financial crisis; Tripartism; Corporate governance; Financial regulation,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/saule_omarova/1/ https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1010/ https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2484&context=facpub https://works.bepress.com/saule_omarova/1/download/ https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-288537957/bankers-bureaucrats-and-guardians-toward-tripartism,https://works.bepress.com/saule_omarova/1/,,,3123635684,,0,,8,False,,,lens

This is also mandated by regulators, such as ICAO, in the form ofrequirements for a safety management system. In order to successfully achieve this, a systemic view ofhuman factors, risks for both the organization and its operations are required. Relationships betweenincident outcomes and contributory factors needs to be further understood. This would involve theclassification of risk data, contributory factors for risk, data-handling from multiple risk data sourcesand the prudent use of safety performance indicators given the availability of existing tools to date.An earlier study (Rigner et al., 2009) proposed a methodology for airlines to explore ways of betterutilizing data already in their organization by the use of existing tools. This methodology includes thesteps of reviewing risk theory, the scope for human factors related to safety, safety performanceindicators, contributory factors and links between these as well as tools for collecting data. The purposeof this study is to apply, validate and further develop this methodology for airline operators as well asto develop a coherent model of systemic risk data management.One of the key issues here is to define the logic behind data management of existing, current andhistorical data and particularly how data can be combined to provide a prospective view of future risk.Without a clear strategy on how to do this, airlines may lose focus and revert to simply measuring whatis readily available, but potentially less meaningful.Research leading up to this development was performed within the HILAS (Human Integration into theLifecycle of Aviation Systems) project. The work has included field studies, work shops and interviewswith both front-line operators and management personnel within airlines. Information-sharing takesplace within the framework of the HILAS project. This research was conducted by a multidisciplinarygroup of human factors expertise: researchers, pilots, investigators and safety officers in an airline.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Engineering; Performance indicator; Systemic risk; Data management; Work (electrical); Management system; Operations management; Scope (project management); Aviation; Data model,,,,,http://swepub.kb.se/bib/swepub:oai:DiVA.org:kth-90262 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:504796,http://swepub.kb.se/bib/swepub:oai:DiVA.org:kth-90262,,,373218570,,0,,2,False,,,lens

A macroprudential approach to oversight has been proposed with a view toward mitigating systemic risk and is now being developed. From a microsystemic risk perspective, such a framework aims to remove incentives for a cross-sectional accumulation of systemic risk. This goal, among others, calls for extending regulatory perimeters and homogenizing regulations across different intermediaries to avoid regulatory arbitrage.

El avance en la teledeteccion ha despertado el interes por explotar potenciales aplicaciones, y esta dando lugar a un intenso desarrollo de innovaciones en distintos campos. Una de estas areas es la gestion del riesgo climatico, en donde la utilizacion de indices de vegetacion permite la evaluacion de la sequia. En esta investigacion, se analiza el impacto de la sequia y se evalua el potencial de nuevas tecnologias como la teledeteccion para la gestion del riesgo de sequia en sistemas de ganaderia extensiva. Para ello, se desarrollan tres aplicaciones: (i) evaluar el impacto economico de la sequia en una explotacion ganadera extensiva de la dehesa de Andalucia, (ii) elaborar mapas de vulnerabilidad a la sequia en pastos de Chile y (iii) disenar y evaluar el potencial de un seguro indexado para sequia en pastos en la region de Coquimbo en Chile. En la primera aplicacion, se disena un modelo dinamico y estocastico que integra aspectos climaticos, ecologicos, agronomicos y socioeconomicos para evaluar el riesgo de sequia. El modelo simula una explotacion ganadera tipo de la dehesa de Andalucia para el periodo 1999-2010. El metodo de Analisis Historico y la simulacion de MonteCarlo se utilizan para identificar los principales factores de riesgo de la explotacion, entre los que destacan, los periodos de inicios del verano e inicios de invierno. Los resultados muestran la existencia de un desfase temporal entre el riesgo climatico y riesgo economico, teniendo este ultimo un periodo de duracion mas extenso en el tiempo. Tambien, revelan que la intensidad, frecuencia y duracion son tres atributos cruciales que determinan el impacto economico de la sequia. La estrategia de reduccion de la carga ganadera permite aminorar el riesgo, pero conlleva una disminucion en el margen bruto de la explotacion. La segunda aplicacion esta dedicada a la elaboracion de mapas de vulnerabilidad a la sequia en pastos de Chile. Para ello, se propone y desarrolla un indice de riesgo economico (IRESP) sencillo de interpretar y replicable, que integra factores de riesgo y estrategias de adaptacion para obtener una medida del Valor en Riesgo, es decir, la maxima perdida esperada en un ano con un nivel de significacion del 5%.La representacion espacial del IRESP pone en evidencia patrones espaciales y diferencias significativas en la vulnerabilidad a la sequia a lo largo de Chile. Ademas, refleja que la vulnerabilidad no siempre esta correlacionada con el riesgo climatico y demuestra la importancia de considerar las estrategias de adaptacion. Las medidas de autocorrelacion espacial revelan que el riesgo sistemico es considerablemente mayor en el sur que en el resto de zonas. Los resultados demuestran que el IRESP transmite informacion pertinente y, que los mapas de vulnerabilidad pueden ser una herramienta util en el diseno de politicas y toma de decisiones para la gestion del riesgo de sequia. La tercera aplicacion evalua el potencial de un seguro indexado para sequia en pastos en la region de Coquimbo en Chile. Para lo cual, se desarrolla un modelo estocastico para estimar la prima actuarialmente justa del seguro y se proponen y evaluan pautas alternativas para mejorar el diseno del contrato. Se aborda el riesgo base, el principal problema de los seguros indexados identificado en la literatura y, que esta referido a la correlacion imperfecta del indice con las perdidas de la explotacion. Para ello, se sigue un enfoque bayesiano que permite evaluar el impacto en el riesgo base de las pautas de diseno propuestas: i) una zonificacion por cluster que considera aspectos espacio-temporales, ii) un periodo de garantia acotado a los ciclos fenologicos del pasto y iii) umbral de garantia. Los resultados muestran que tanto la zonificacion como el periodo de garantia reducen el riesgo base considerablemente. Sin embargo, el umbral de garantia tiene un efecto ambiguo sobre el riesgo base. Por otra parte, la zonificacion por cluster contribuye a aminorar el riesgo sistemico que enfrentan las aseguradoras. Estos resultados han puesto de manifiesto que un buen diseno de contrato puede tener un doble dividendo, por un lado aumentar su utilidad y, por otro, reducir el coste del seguro. Un diseno de contrato eficiente junto con los avances en la teledeteccion y un adecuado marco institucional son los pilares basicos para el buen funcionamiento de un programa de seguro. Las nuevas tecnologias ofrecen un importante potencial para la innovacion en la gestion del riesgo climatico. Los avances en este campo pueden proporcionar importantes beneficios sociales en los paises en desarrollo y regiones vulnerables, donde las herramientas para gestionar eficazmente los riesgos sistemicos como la sequia pueden ser de gran ayuda para el desarrollo. The vulnerability of grazing livestock systems highlights the need for tools to assess and mitigate the adverse impact of drought. The recent and rapid progress in remote sensing has awakened an interest for tapping into potential applications, triggering intensive efforts to develop innovations in a number of spheres. One of these areas is climate risk management, where the use of vegetation indices facilitates assessment of drought. This research analyzes drought impacts and evaluates the potential of new technologies such as remote sensing to manage drought risk in extensive livestock systems. Three essays in drought risk management are developed to: (i) assess the economic impact of drought on a livestock farm in the Andalusian Dehesa, (ii) build drought vulnerability maps in Chilean grazing lands, and (iii) design and evaluate the potential of an index insurance policy to address the risk of drought in grazing lands in Coquimbo, Chile. In the first essay, a dynamic and stochastic farm model is designed combining climate, agronomic, socio-economic and ecological aspects to assess drought risk. The model is developed to simulate a representative livestock farm in the Dehesa of Andalusia for the time period 1999-2010. Burn analysis and MonteCarlo simulation methods are used to identify the significance of various risk sources at the farm. Most notably, early summer and early winter are identified as periods of peak risk. Moreover, there is a significant time lag between climate and economic risk and this later last longer than the former. It is shown that intensity, frequency and duration of the drought are three crucial attributes that shape the economic impact of drought. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the sustainability of farm management strategies and demonstrates that lowering the stocking rate reduces farmer exposure to drought risk but entails a reduction in the expected gross margin. The second essay, mapping drought vulnerability in Chilean grazing lands, proposes and builds an index of economic risk (IRESP) that is replicable and simple to interpret. This methodology integrates risk factors and adaptation strategies to deliver information on Value at Risk, maximum expected losses at 5% significance level. Mapping IRESP provides evidence about spatial patterns and significant differences in drought vulnerability across Chilean grazing lands. Spatial autocorrelation measures reveal that systemic risk is considerably larger in the South as compared to Northern or Central Regions. Furthermore, it is shown that vulnerability is not necessarily correlated with climate risk and that adaptation strategies do matter. These results show that IRESP conveys relevant information and that vulnerability maps may be useful tools to assess policy design and decision-making in drought risk management. The third essay develops a stochastic model to estimate the actuarially fair premium and evaluates the potential of an indexed insurance policy to manage drought risk in Coquimbo, a relevant livestock farming region of Chile. Basis risk refers to the imperfect correlation of the index and farmer loses and is identified in the literature as a main limitation of index insurance. A Bayesian approach is proposed to assess the impact on basis risk of alternative guidelines in contract design: i) A cluster zoning that considers space-time aspects, ii) A guarantee period bounded to fit phenological cycles, and iii) the triggering index threshold. Results show that both the proposed zoning and guarantee period considerably reduces basis risk. However, the triggering index threshold has an ambiguous effect on basis risk. On the other hand, cluster zoning contributes to ameliorate systemic risk faced by the insurer. These results highlighted that adequate contract design is important and may result in double dividend. On the one hand, increasing farmers’ utility and, secondly, reducing the cost of insurance. An efficient contract design coupled with advances in remote sensing and an appropriate institutional framework are the basis for an efficient operation of an insurance program. The new technologies offer significant potential for innovation in climate risk managements. Progress in this field is capturing increasing attention and may provide important social gains in developing countries and vulnerable regions where the tools to efficiently manage systemic risks, such as drought, may be a means to foster development.",,,,,,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=73729 http://oa.upm.es/14631/,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=73729,,,1536809047,,0,,0,False,,,lens

084-551-217-582-178,Novel and systemic risk factors for knee and hip osteoarthritis,,,dissertation,,,,,Monira Hussain,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem and the most common cause of disability. Growing evidence suggests that OA is a disease of the whole joint. However, the etiology and risk factors of OA have not been fully elucidated, and there is no registered disease modifying drug to halt disease progression. Over recent years, new approaches and initiatives have been adapted for better understanding the disease pathology and mechanisms underlying the risk factors, such as the role of hormonal factors, metabolic and vascular factors, vitamin D and birth weight. This project attempted to investigate these systemic and novel risk factors for the incidence of knee and hip replacement for OA in linkage studies.; ; In this thesis knee and hip replacement for OA were used as a surrogate for severe OA which provides evidence of the true problem and signifies the economic burden. The study populations were the participants of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study which were linked to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry to determine the incidence of knee and hip replacement for OA.; ; The initial focus of this thesis was on the association between hormonal factors and risk of total knee and hip replacement for OA. A lower estradiol concentration was a risk factor for total knee replacement for OA, while a lower androstenedione concentration and higher Sex Hormone Binding Globulin concentration were risk factors for total hip replacement for OA in women. Moreover, a lower index-to-ring finger length ratio, a proxy indicator of in-utero testosterone exposure, was associated with an increased risk of total knee replacement for OA but not the risk of total hip replacement for OA. ; ; The second part of this thesis examined the relationship between metabolic and vascular factors and the risk of knee and hip replacement for OA. The metabolic syndrome and cumulative number of metabolic syndrome components were both associated with increased risk of total knee replacement for OA, with no association observed for total hip replacement for OA. Additionally, retinal arteriolar narrowing was associated with increased risk of knee replacement for OA. These findings suggest that metabolic and vascular factors play a role in the pathogenesis of knee OA.; ; The third part of this thesis examined the association between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations and the risk of hip replacement for OA. Higher serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations were associated with an increased risk of hip replacement for OA in males but not in females.; ; Finally, this thesis examined the association between birth weight and risk of knee and hip replacement for OA. Individuals born with low birth weight or preterm birth were at increased risk of hip replacement for OA but not knee replacement for OA in adult life. ; ; In conclusion, this thesis has made major contribution to the understanding of the role of hormonal factors, metabolic and vascular factors, serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration and birth weight in the pathogenesis of knee and hip OA. This thesis has highlighted the significant heterogeneity in terms of the risk factors for OA and that knee and hip OA are susceptible to different risk factors. This study has identified novel targets for the prevention and treatment of knee and hip OA separately that are likely to have an impact on this debilitating disease.",,,,,Internal medicine; Cohort study; Joint replacement registry; Osteoarthritis; Hip replacement (animal); Knee replacement; Metabolic syndrome; Risk factor; Birth weight; Medicine,,,,,https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Novel_and_systemic_risk_factors_for_knee_and_hip_osteoarthritis/4705348/1,http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/03/58b6384243f08,,10.4225/03/58b6384243f08,2596116370,,0,000-093-373-383-602; 000-132-318-921-964; 000-224-184-965-360; 001-126-698-533-677; 002-175-903-056-863; 002-472-344-081-595; 002-748-915-319-283; 003-057-812-903-35X; 003-503-688-633-520; 003-640-645-627-690; 004-181-347-687-085; 004-460-449-707-35X; 005-796-434-489-025; 006-115-352-621-010; 007-669-435-866-700; 009-011-167-937-198; 009-287-137-833-002; 009-293-871-509-97X; 011-043-226-910-04X; 011-779-516-783-271; 012-689-484-606-808; 012-880-910-869-033; 013-152-982-712-36X; 013-200-745-395-157; 013-302-656-856-887; 014-376-780-558-746; 014-848-758-207-686; 016-554-479-462-085; 019-434-449-832-703; 019-505-987-508-228; 019-576-912-679-821; 019-744-644-692-797; 019-857-221-662-888; 024-245-922-324-164; 024-936-130-917-386; 025-270-124-142-762; 025-584-718-022-217; 026-004-223-368-526; 026-062-934-059-696; 026-203-073-734-544; 028-170-550-831-334; 028-373-805-071-999; 028-457-422-510-569; 030-770-863-576-195; 031-930-185-022-172; 032-045-362-953-969; 036-693-286-609-410; 037-194-855-892-042; 038-257-842-977-815; 038-315-531-381-988; 039-667-777-287-241; 040-344-628-373-145; 040-649-140-444-023; 043-347-243-891-905; 045-614-226-792-944; 047-062-043-862-452; 047-679-500-940-832; 047-697-483-883-133; 052-411-098-550-054; 052-431-423-059-268; 052-977-237-637-671; 053-801-018-496-757; 056-383-495-600-318; 058-528-726-959-086; 060-111-568-792-53X; 060-672-555-424-260; 060-700-937-878-685; 062-187-922-868-626; 063-435-476-686-000; 064-328-613-696-292; 064-849-029-973-450; 065-345-339-781-080; 067-473-654-121-962; 068-024-509-113-969; 068-880-506-537-127; 069-497-375-407-529; 069-586-933-912-701; 074-805-337-726-329; 075-870-721-612-729; 076-129-180-722-072; 079-949-196-192-988; 081-750-803-271-180; 081-987-871-936-32X; 084-987-106-306-653; 086-309-564-764-424; 088-765-530-216-608; 095-297-850-269-29X; 095-638-143-058-162; 096-358-077-146-390; 096-493-627-990-855; 100-193-726-849-548; 100-449-087-019-607; 105-962-170-147-641; 109-890-776-625-738; 112-096-103-564-483; 119-507-085-323-536; 119-692-011-987-943; 120-660-361-436-374; 122-245-305-369-60X; 122-719-707-795-355; 125-661-736-352-940; 126-809-676-744-292; 129-988-056-400-97X; 130-972-583-806-209; 131-612-082-419-996; 132-099-187-831-209; 133-263-230-403-073; 139-652-870-508-719; 142-639-188-318-244,0,False,,,lens
145-460-978-569-047,A Non-cyclical Capital Adequacy Rule and the Aversion of Systemic Risk,,2014.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Raphael Douady,"We present in this note a method for computing the regulatory capital of financial institutions, along with the Basel Committee requirements, which avoids the pitfalls of the Value-at-Risk and, in particular, the fact that – as observed during 2008 crisis – it aggravates systemic risk rather than preventing it. The computation is based on stress testing, with the following principles: (i) market scenarios are defined by the regulator; (ii) sensitivities are estimated by each institution, as well as the impact of scenarios defined by the regulator and reported to it; (iii) the regulator not only counts the number of violations of the risk reporting but also their size; (iv) the regulatory capital is a multiple of the worst stress test, where the multiplier depends on the size and the frequency of the violations. By letting the institutions estimate their sensitivities to extreme market shifts, the regulator not only avoids a costly burden, but also keeps institutions responsible for their reporting. On the other hand, by keeping control on the list of stress tests involved in the computation of the capital, the regulator offers itself a very strong lever to prevent speculative bubbles, by making them costly in terms of capital requirements.",,,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Control (management); Stress test; Capital requirement; Monetary economics; Regulator; Stress testing (software); Capital (economics),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/cesptp/hal-01478302.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/cesptp/hal-01478302.html,,,3122846014,,0,,0,False,,,lens

We propose a Tail Event driven Network Quantile Regression (TENQR) model which addresses these three aspects. More precisely, our framework captures the risk propagation and dynamics in terms of a quantile (or expectile) autoregression involving network effects quantified through an adjacency matrix. To reflect the nature and risk content of systemic risk, the construction of the adjacency matrix is suggested to include tail event covariates. The model is evaluated using the SIFIs (systemically important financial institutions) identified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as main players in the global financial system. The risk decomposition analysis of it identifies the systemic importance of SIFIs and thus provides measures for the required level of additional loss absorbency. It is discovered that the network effect, as a function of the tail probability, becomes more profound in stress situations and brings the various impacts to the SIFIs located in different geographic regions.",,,,,Quantile; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Adjacency matrix; Event (probability theory); Network analysis; Computer science; Quantile regression; Financial econometrics; Network effect,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:hum:wpaper:sfb649dp2017-004 https://ideas.repec.org/p/hum/wpaper/sfb649dp2017-004.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:hum:wpaper:sfb649dp2017-004,,,3123864460,,0,,0,False,,,lens

We introduce a model that accounts not only for losses transmitted after banks default, but also for losses due to the fact that creditors revalue their exposures when probabilities of default of their counterparties change. We apply the model to run a series of simplified stress tests of the UK banking system from 2008 to 2016, based on two datasets of real interbank exposures between the seven major UK banks. We show that risks due to solvency contagion decrease markedly from the peak of the crisis, to the point of becoming negligible. We also characterise the distributions of both vulnerabilities and systemic importances of individual banks, thereby tracking the evolution of risk concentration.",108,,103755,,Systemic risk; Discount points; Creditor; Economics; Financial networks; Solvency; Financial contagion; Contagion risk; Forward looking; Monetary economics,,,,H2020,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10087373/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/dyncon/v108y2019ics0165188919301526.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188919301526,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2019.103755,,10.1016/j.jedc.2019.103755,2974315362,,0,003-803-424-332-155; 005-021-488-657-916; 005-911-613-506-055; 006-249-317-301-226; 006-381-442-206-445; 006-654-454-132-907; 010-787-191-725-48X; 012-375-232-998-372; 013-118-111-585-482; 015-330-084-659-28X; 016-665-645-839-960; 017-535-364-140-820; 023-310-771-796-798; 023-920-010-872-504; 025-915-350-487-916; 026-277-648-555-398; 026-368-711-109-491; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-306-352-344-019; 031-792-997-463-915; 034-618-882-762-654; 035-477-508-309-18X; 038-577-220-575-718; 038-670-586-706-918; 041-786-210-324-199; 042-599-326-782-08X; 048-297-576-911-977; 054-293-409-557-957; 054-652-736-199-220; 054-909-517-727-91X; 055-152-571-477-725; 055-789-813-214-660; 057-505-167-634-278; 058-879-947-933-394; 061-047-185-991-841; 065-327-126-170-308; 073-141-158-334-957; 074-470-461-039-495; 075-897-862-903-52X; 077-869-088-884-650; 078-964-547-449-925; 081-300-790-738-264; 086-749-144-178-33X; 088-149-451-347-256; 092-575-804-459-859; 094-358-206-649-929; 096-557-298-164-56X; 109-381-535-599-334; 114-072-503-092-856; 115-806-665-215-624; 117-903-132-807-368; 124-610-314-675-858; 147-055-809-833-920; 157-086-115-812-927; 177-515-669-057-407,6,True,,green,lens

Specifically, we attempt to gauge the experience and assess the degree of tensions among banking practitioners’ perspectives on the reformed banking liquidity practice and risk-capital management in light of the newly introduced increased capital and liquidity requirements, which are to become fully and unilaterally effective as of 2019. As currently seen the liquidity provision requirement has become a distinct form of ‘sharing’ financial risks in the global economy, which includes the supply of capital from its issuers. This article reviews the issue from a European perspective attempting to gain insight into: (1) the suggestion that the new regulations lack internal consistency owed to their complexity, which creates the potential for both inter- and intra-company regulatory capital arbitrage and credit constriction; and (2) the suggestion that increased capital and liquidity requirements may have a significant impact on bank behaviour and/or certain business model segments. Both of the above can potentially distort managerial behaviour through altering managerial incentives and hence fail to adequately regulate bank behaviour. With regard to the liquidity requirements, whilst we do not attempt to quantifiably assess the degree to which liquidity regulations (the liquidity coverage ratio in particular—LCR henceforth) affect returns on equity/assets to banks, our interviews are used as a triangulating measure for complementing quantitative studies that can provide a further insight into the perception of affecting managerial incentives. We aim to add to, update, and enrich the studies around the vital research question of whether the new regulation and liquidity standards can achieve their ultimate objective of upholding financial soundness and stability. Therefore, this research is important to complete the extant literature on updated insiders’ perspectives that investigate the effectiveness of the new regulatory framework imminently to be fully applicable by 2019. Where the views of the professionals who have voiced their concerns, support, and/or proposals provide for a material contribution, these have also been provided.",20,2,136,158,Accounting; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Equity (finance); Basel III; Capital requirement; Business model; Financial risk,,,,,https://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/id/eprint/41839/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jbkreg/v20y2019i2d10.1057_s41261-018-0076-1.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41261-018-0076-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fs41261-018-0076-1.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/161097729.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41261-018-0076-1,,10.1057/s41261-018-0076-1,2887853171,,0,001-465-039-790-414; 005-272-055-082-80X; 006-720-773-417-435; 012-096-907-574-534; 017-786-317-483-827; 018-392-325-202-807; 019-169-263-065-505; 020-591-485-550-302; 027-401-395-869-648; 027-756-794-397-097; 028-664-312-546-140; 036-982-805-956-950; 038-215-157-008-201; 038-424-712-943-751; 040-279-794-996-710; 044-146-030-414-713; 046-141-661-686-408; 046-459-669-048-363; 046-989-890-031-120; 050-337-097-629-46X; 056-391-567-168-027; 056-393-642-848-954; 059-619-584-086-506; 065-372-061-682-574; 066-282-114-278-944; 066-433-743-299-567; 066-571-230-436-226; 068-420-971-730-822; 068-847-264-689-149; 071-191-695-139-324; 074-039-325-848-37X; 080-122-833-955-467; 080-788-318-730-280; 085-938-812-017-66X; 086-300-327-787-373; 086-353-520-420-644; 088-953-595-650-024; 094-051-492-339-895; 095-406-833-810-742; 101-935-591-828-93X; 105-448-564-611-628; 119-471-702-234-087; 127-501-766-082-97X; 129-238-263-619-699; 134-509-841-140-827; 137-897-052-049-541; 138-034-838-553-451; 139-099-854-843-639; 139-396-775-665-572; 141-532-877-945-124; 158-236-571-423-535; 163-975-214-848-834; 168-809-691-072-790; 170-028-094-087-070; 171-344-399-453-458; 175-099-561-215-87X; 176-980-634-315-629,9,True,,green,lens

Mishkin,"This paper argues that although financial consolidation creates some dangers because it is leading to larger institutions who might expose the U.S. financial system to increased systemic risk, these dangers can be handled by vigilant supervision and a government safety net with an appropriate amount of constructive ambiguity. Financial consolidation also opens up opportunities to dramatically reduce the scope of deposit insurance and limit it to narrow bank accounts, thus substantially reducing the moral hazard created by the government safety net. Reducing the scope of deposit insurance, however, does not eliminate the need for a government safety net, and thus there is still a strong need for adequate prudential supervision of the financial system. Moving to a world in which we have larger, nationwide, diversified financial institutions and in which deposit insurance plays a very limited role, should improve the efficiency of the financial system. However, it is no panacea: the job of financial regulators and supervisors will continue to be highly challenging in the future.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Government; Panacea (medicine); Consolidation (business); Deposit insurance; Safety net; Moral hazard; Scope (project management),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/6655.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/nbrnberwo/6655.htm,,,3122150764,,0,,15,False,,,lens

The attractiveness of cryptocurrencies is due in part to their decentralized, peer-to-peer structure. This makes them an alternative to national currencies which are controlled by central banks. Given that these cryptocurrencies are already replacing some of the “regular” national currencies and financial products, the question then arises: should they be regulated? And if so, how? This paper draws the legal distinction between cryptocurrencies which are in fact currency and those which are securities disguised as currency. It further suggests that in cases where a token is indeed a security, regular securities regulation should apply. In all other cases anti-fraud measures should be in place in order to protect investors. Further regulation should only be put in place if the cryptocurrency starts increasing systemic risk in the general financial system.",,,,,Financial services; Currency; Business; Systemic risk; Cryptocurrency; Order (exchange); Popularity; Product (business); Financial regulation; Monetary economics,,,,,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3119591 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3119591 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3141361_code1775905.pdf?abstractid=3119591&mirid=1&type=2 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3119591 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3409019_code1775905.pdf?abstractid=3119591&mirid=1,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3119591,,10.2139/ssrn.3119591,2791365481,,0,039-831-429-965-271; 050-105-396-285-676; 080-686-200-451-270; 104-881-123-052-104; 108-466-681-926-328; 127-473-453-684-851; 132-359-809-010-164; 167-471-084-810-77X,6,True,,green,lens

190-480-018-138-709,Credit risk management : Possibilities for a housing price insurance on the Swedish market - lessons from Canada,,2011.0,,,,,,John Hunter; Jakob Westin,"The deregulation of the financial markets that started over two decades ago in the developed countries has led to increased house prices and loan to value ratios. Home owners in western countries have over the last two decades steadily decreased their savings and at the same time increased the size of their mortgages and the amount of leverage used to purchase their homes. This development has increased the financial risk for homeowners which recently became clear in the United States when prices on homes started to fall rapidly in 2007. Due to this development Finansinspektionen in Sweden has enforced new regulation on mortgage lending making it more expensive for home owners to use high leverage ratios. Finansinspektionen is responsible for consumer protection in terms of financial products and the new regulation aims to protect mortgage borrowers. Finansinspektionen suggests that an insurance that protects the borrower from loss could be used as an alternative to the regulation restricting the amount of leverage. Finansinspektionen also mentions the Canadian mortgage market as an example where compulsory mortgage insurances are enforced today. In Canada the borrower must take out a mortgage insurance when the mortgage exceeds 80 percent of the house value. However, we find that the Canadian mortgage insurance system would not fulfil the aim of Finansinspektionen’s regulation. The Canadian mortgage insurances are constructed to protect the lender against default and there purpose was initially to increase lending. When examining the basic structure of mortgage and home value insurance products we find that such products and systems are complicated to construct to match the Finansinspektionen requirements and purpose due to issues such as moral hazard, adverse selection, price, willingness to pay and systemic risk.",,,,,Finance; Shared appreciation mortgage; Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Loan-to-value ratio; Credit risk; Secondary mortgage market; Moral hazard; Mortgage underwriting; Mortgage insurance,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:490767,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:490767,,,619642372,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Méndez; Floriane Clement; Guillermo Palau Salvador; Ricardo Díaz-Delgado; Sergio Villamayor-Tomas,"<p>To enable sustainability pathways, we need to understand how social-ecological systems (SES) respond to different governance configurations, considering their historical, institutional, political and power conditions. We advance a robust methodological approach for the integrated analysis of those conditions in SES traps. Our advancement consists of a novel combination of the Networks of Action Situations (NAS) approach with an agency-based polycentric power typology and the concept of discursive power. We test the approach by building on previous research on the Doñana estuary-delta SES (Guadalquivir estuary), which is characterized by a rigidity trap in the context of ecosystem and water governance. Specifically, we focus on a recent hydraulic megaproject involving deep dredging in the Guadalquivir estuary, finally canceled due to its broad negative socioeconomic and environmental repercussions. According to our analysis, certain governance, institutional and informational mechanisms currently prevent further SES degradation in Doñana. However, key governance actors are caught in a lasting coordination failure prone to mutual defection strategies owing to power dynamics and discursive-institutional inertia. Although seemingly stable due to counteractive mechanisms among actors, this situation is at continuous risk of being unbalanced by powerful actors promoting large SES interventions such as deep dredging. Such interventions bear the systemic risk of strong suppression of SES functions, and a regime shift to a lock-in trap. This overall undesirable situation might be escaped through transformative policy designs that take into account meso-level mechanisms, such as discursive power and its role in non-decision-making, pragmatic inaction, and inefficient investment and infrastructure.</p>",,,,,Corporate governance; Sustainability; Context (archaeology); Environmental governance; Deliberation; Political science; Business; Economics; Environmental planning; Politics; Ecology; Geography; Finance; Law; Biology; Archaeology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b3p7h,,10.31235/osf.io/b3p7h,,,0,,1,True,,green,lens
151-913-595-563-402,Regulation of Financial Services Industries: Selected Global Approaches,2012-09-01,2012.0,journal article,The International Journal of Management,22775846,,,James S. Sagner,"This article discusses the alternative approaches to financial regulation in current use in selected major economies, varying from functional regulation in the U.S. to consolidated regulation in the U.K. and Japan. Specific comments are provided on the successes and failures of each approach. The conclusion is that a consolidated regulatory scheme is preferable to the functional model, organized by individual investor and by business investor risk category; e.g., insurance risk for the safety of customer funds that are on deposit with a financial services firm, business risk to protect the integrity of the intermediation process, and systemic risk for the security of the financial system. The world's financial services industry has been undergoing a series of dynamic transitions for at least the past two decades. Change factors include technology, globalization, nearly universal acceptance of capitalism, the ending of trade barriers, the strategic decision by companies to pursue apparent opportunities outside of traditional lines of business and the global credit crisis that began in 2008. The situation is complicated for governments that have attempted to respond to these changes due to varying forms of regulation used in the leading economies. These approaches vary from functional regulation in the U.S. to consolidated regulation in the U.K. and Japan. This paper reviews the current state of financial regulation and concludes with specific comments on the successes and failures of each approach. The senior executives of the Megafinancial Corporation (MegaFi) are attending their regular weekly strategy meeting chaired by the company 's president and CEO, Seymour Dough. The major agenda item is the consideration of a new product idea sponsored by the Vice President for Marketing, Will Sell. MegaFi is a leader in the global financial markets in securities, insurance and banking, but is facing increased competitive pressures and additional scrutiny from regulators in the major developed countries. The new product - Universal Mortgage - is intended to solidify the company 's position in real estate by offering a new variation on mortgage lending. MegaFi believes that current depressed conditions in real estate offer an opportunity for a new approach to mortgage lending that could eventually lead to a significant share of the market. The concept is a mortgage loan based on the appraised value of the home or commercial property, but with a guarantee of 75% of the average annual increase in property value (if any) experienced in the property 's market area (for example, in the county or zip code location in the U.S.). The increase would be based on transactions for equivalent property from sales data as recorded by a local board of realtors.' In an example provided at the meeting by Will Sell, a house owned for ten years with a $300, 000 mortgage (based on an original appraisal of $400, 000) could be sold back to MegaFiat a guaranteed average annual gain of 6%, which is 7 5% ofthe area's residential property increase of 8%. The homeowner would net $446,400 2 without having to go through the process of selling the house or paying a real estate agent's commission (6% in most places in the U.S.), and without risking apnee reduction due to a temporary market decline. MegaFi would then be able to sell the house for whatever price the market sets, presumably $863, 600, 3 through its real estate agency, without paying any agent's commission (as all ofthe company's agents are salaried). Of course, the homeowner could always choose to sell his house through the conventional process, but he would experience delays in listing time, showing time including open houses, mortgage contingency and inspection time for the buyer, and closing time. The obvious advantage to MegaFi is the potential profit of nearly $150,000;4 the benefit to the homeowner is a guarantee executed at the time ofthe original purchase of 75% ofthe appreciation of equivalent property and no waiting period to complete the transaction. …",29,3,288,,Finance; Financial services; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Commission; Appraised value; Financial regulation; Real estate; Business risks,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2762924171/regulation-of-financial-services-industries-selected,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2762924171/regulation-of-financial-services-industries-selected,,,278569865,,0,,0,False,,,lens

ABSTRACT The world financial market identified the eminence for socially responsible investment touched by the business organizations due to the pressure of the society to encourage them to follow the sustainable development model and, hence, created indexes with the objective to reunite them as a way to verify the profitability of these applications: in Brazil, in 2005, the business sustainable index was created (BSI). Such question represents a challenge for the organizations because there’s a controversy about this, for one side, the theoretical current of shareholder defends that the enterprises must generate an amount only to the shareholders and, by the theoretical current of the stakeholder, this group is extended for the society, customers, suppliers, etc. Over this academic controversy, studies realized in the Brazilian scenery verified if the sustainable organizations were more lucrative or not in relation to the organizations that didn’t adopt this practice, however the pointed results in these studies were conflicting between each other. Thereby, as a way to contribute for the theme discussion, this study had as objective to investigate the risk and return relations of the enterprises that are members of the BSI in the period of 2008 to 2010, verifying if they show bigger average returns and smaller systemic risks. To reach this objective, we used the F test with 5% of significance. The results found suggest that the average returns and the systemic risks of the sample, compared to the amounts of a control group in pairs with it, were not significant. In other words, the listed enterprises in the BSI don’t offer significant advantages compared to the enterprises in the control group in any analyzed period. We recommend other researches about the theme including the segment banks that belong to the BSI and a larger period of investigation. Keywords : Sustainable Development.

It is equally capable of undermining macroeconomic performance and therefore constitutes a very significant risk to both soundness and stability of any financial institution. Foreign direct investments are therefore adversely affected. Unlike that of the capitalist economy and other conventional banking institutions, the risks which ML poses to Islamic finance attracted little or no critical study. This could give the impression that Islamic finance is not in tune with Anti-Money Laundering Laws (AML) and the regulatory regime or that it is anti-AML. The resultant effect of this is unnecessary hostility to Islamic Financial products, which appears not to be in the interest of global economy.

It is revealed that while no financial institution is immune to laundering, the risk-sharing nature of Islamic finances poses less systemic risk than conventional finance.

Our main contribution is the development of a systemic risk measure Delta Quantile-Located Conditional Autoregressive Expected Shortfall, ΔQLMV−CoCARES. This new measure captures the extreme downside risk in terms of the ES of the system should both the financial system and the institution simultaneously be in distress. The evidence suggests that cross significant volatility and ES effects exist between the system and financial institutions. Furthermore, our measure presents better forecasting performance than standard or novel systemic risk measures based on VaR such as CoVaR or ΔQLMV−CoCAViaR and it is effective at predicting financial crises. We also develop a new systemic stress indicator SSIES based on ΔQLMV−CoCARES systemic risk measure which presents higher forecasting ability than other standard stress indicators.</jats:p>",21,1,1,72,Quantile; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Multivariate statistics; Mathematics,,,,,http://academic.oup.com/jfec/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jjfinec/nbaa050/36349128/nbaa050.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbaa050,,10.1093/jjfinec/nbaa050,3130999644,,0,000-104-254-929-992; 001-274-723-652-948; 001-479-651-999-983; 004-644-450-850-109; 005-922-988-268-798; 006-491-472-590-553; 007-398-058-153-868; 008-063-522-305-207; 008-479-042-011-321; 008-509-116-471-262; 009-371-534-301-730; 009-926-395-777-419; 010-343-664-389-328; 012-231-431-152-115; 012-525-456-033-239; 013-244-730-266-402; 013-537-266-431-88X; 015-111-888-186-326; 018-168-475-223-121; 021-172-045-260-061; 022-304-930-380-208; 022-358-408-158-616; 024-465-633-104-522; 024-828-296-919-906; 034-070-166-715-290; 034-506-125-461-911; 036-765-900-901-244; 037-122-689-375-425; 042-359-804-509-609; 042-389-907-188-892; 043-587-030-139-536; 045-283-165-008-496; 045-599-041-334-450; 046-352-365-586-832; 046-484-791-935-331; 047-590-216-708-912; 048-131-116-146-418; 048-332-187-830-533; 052-187-280-017-818; 052-950-632-687-919; 056-041-050-320-014; 056-084-592-994-224; 057-175-125-323-966; 057-203-943-288-264; 057-845-058-337-355; 061-814-564-097-318; 064-586-496-729-797; 068-926-087-240-142; 069-238-937-251-989; 069-677-919-058-194; 070-068-604-264-120; 070-489-793-724-987; 071-587-032-736-41X; 074-170-580-336-674; 079-394-100-805-449; 080-672-111-417-698; 084-090-075-592-338; 092-714-135-858-55X; 094-836-682-333-662; 098-810-406-052-231; 099-115-796-601-17X; 102-850-016-997-677; 103-310-519-835-660; 110-493-884-621-554; 110-818-696-196-864; 112-976-303-677-568; 114-834-647-050-047; 115-806-665-215-624; 116-431-610-698-356; 122-779-428-131-390; 127-123-260-609-038; 127-134-528-683-700; 134-679-744-503-78X; 135-686-400-830-121; 136-342-668-308-059; 142-152-017-536-613; 142-283-968-423-876; 146-148-603-590-018; 146-399-055-378-628; 153-779-195-390-459; 161-277-950-172-86X; 161-388-814-416-825; 168-422-163-339-942; 179-085-738-786-351; 181-953-131-517-867; 196-120-155-272-989; 198-831-686-707-017,0,False,,,lens

The data collected were surgical and were retrospectively analyzed. The data collected included medical history, local, patient satisfaction, marginal bone loss, and systemic risk factors affecting implant survival. Outcome variables assessed were peri-implantitis, implant success, and survival at the follow-up visit. The data were expressed in terms of percentage and number, and the results were derived.Peri-implantitis was seen in 31.05% (n = 136) of implants. 76.02% (n = 333) of implants were considered successful at recall. Concerning survival, compromised and satisfactory survival was shown by 10.04% (n = 44) and 2.96% (n = 13) of implants, respectively. 10.95% (n = 48) of implants were considered as failures.The present study concludes that good, long-term survival rates are associated with full mouth rehabilitation using dental implants.",14,5,1014,1014,Medicine; Rehabilitation; Dentistry; Implant; Survival rate; Tooth loss; Peri-implantitis; Physical therapy; Oral health; Surgery,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_788_21,,10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_788_21,,,0,006-848-703-177-862; 020-958-628-675-507; 021-670-505-787-924; 054-558-279-577-490; 058-990-745-152-739; 094-046-335-404-861; 098-984-561-766-795; 136-601-029-258-132,0,True,cc-by-nc-sa,gold,lens

Suppose (X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A relevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of influence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways. In this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t] called Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t] called Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of risk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance, insurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under the assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and asymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful model classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive the asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to infinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in the models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this reflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains significant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce an extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and MES for high thresholds t where little data are available. We show that these estimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and real data sets.",,,,,Estimator; Econometrics; Independence (probability theory); Extrapolation; Mathematics; Consistency (knowledge bases); Systemic risk; Extreme value theory; Economics; Statistics; Mathematical economics; Discrete mathematics; Financial crisis; Macroeconomics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1603.09406,,10.48550/arxiv.1603.09406,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

As a result, some assets will have to be liquidated and sold to outsiders at firesale prices, giving rise to a potentially high losses given default (LGDs) for creditors of failed institutions. This study analyzes the consequences of this firesale mechanism for systemic risk. Our findings suggest that systemic risk is likely to be heavily underestimated when the potential for firesales, and thereby the endogenous nature of LGDs, is not taken into account. The magnitude of the negative bias increases with asset return correlations, banks’ return variability, the degree of asset specificity of bank loans and the degree of concentration in the banking sector. The analysis suggests that time-varying liquidity requirements are an effective way to reduce the potential for firesales and thereby lower systemic risk.",44,,145,157,Financial economics; Debt; Loss given default; Business; Systemic risk; Creditor; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Asset specificity; Asset return; Monetary economics,,,,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927539817300877 https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/systemic-risk-with-endogenous-loss-given-default https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/empfin/v44y2017icp145-157.html https://core.ac.uk/display/92653563 https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/systemic-risk-with-endogenous-loss-given-default(7e9c3e1d-1e12-4302-a473-2886c88acd02).html https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F7e9c3e1d-1e12-4302-a473-2886c88acd02 https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/systemic-risk-with-endogenous-loss-given-default,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jempfin.2017.09.012,,10.1016/j.jempfin.2017.09.012,2763718046,,0,002-856-834-652-090; 003-758-832-327-304; 003-803-424-332-155; 006-381-442-206-445; 010-992-763-475-15X; 011-694-578-272-482; 015-330-084-659-28X; 017-174-524-823-567; 017-486-496-247-162; 024-683-400-469-155; 024-828-296-919-906; 026-277-648-555-398; 030-306-352-344-019; 035-104-934-704-682; 052-619-799-818-546; 056-084-592-994-224; 057-505-167-634-278; 057-792-401-373-577; 061-187-520-305-47X; 063-231-522-252-189; 069-075-831-555-278; 075-897-862-903-52X; 078-894-821-491-595; 109-825-859-874-050; 111-721-296-524-027; 113-272-606-061-219; 114-072-503-092-856; 115-806-665-215-624; 134-548-354-615-84X; 142-130-724-224-398; 153-779-195-390-459,3,True,,green,lens

Laster,"A hedge fund is a privately offered investment vehicle that pools the contributions of investors in order to invest in a variety of assets, such as securities, futures, options, bonds and currencies. Hedge funds have attracted growing attention from policy makers, financial market participants and the general public due to their rapid growth and substantial scale, their importance to banks as clients and the impact of their trading activity on global capital markets. Because of their rapid growth and the market disruptions caused by Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998, some analysts believe that hedge funds pose systemic risks. However, this is unlikely. A thorough review of the avenues through which hedge funds could cause systemic problems indicates that, although a major disruption emanating from the hedge fund sector is possible, it would be diffi cult for the sector to be highly disruptive to fi nancial markets. Post-LTCM, regulatory authorities have encouraged banks to monitor their hedge fund clients through constraints on their leverage. This has thus far proven effective, as the recent failure of Amaranth demonstrates. That failure, the largest yet, caused hardly a ripple in the wider financial markets. Hedge funds support the robustness of markets in many ways. They provide attractive investment alternatives and improve economy-wide risk sharing. In addition, they promote fi nancial market stability by assuming risks that other market participants are unwilling or unable to bear; by providing liquidity; and by placing trades that move mispriced assets toward their “fundamental” values. Of course, hedge funds could raise problems through their dominant role in some markets, active trading strategies, use of leverage and relative lack of transparency. Counterparties must therefore be cognizant of the risks they bear from hedge funds. Also, regulators must continue to promote better hedge fund risk management and transparency through their regulation of counterparties while remaining vigilant about potential systemic risks emanating from the sector. On balance, however, hedge funds enhance market stability and are unlikely to be the source of a systemic failure.",,10,45,54,Finance; Open-end fund; Economics; Alternative beta; Hedge fund; Institutional investor; Fund of funds; Hedge accounting; Prime brokerage; Global assets under management; Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bfr:fisrev:2007:10:5 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bfr/fisrev/2007105.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bfr:fisrev:2007:10:5,,,1553405558,,0,,6,False,,,lens

Dual representations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to obtain the main results of this paper on time consistency; namely, an equivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to multiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of multivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets with transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal (1995), Roux and Zastawniak (2016), Loehne and Rudloff (2014)) does not satisfy the usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in (Feinstein and Rudloff (2021)), scalar risk measures with the same scalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The deduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time consistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires consideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a direct notion of a ""moving scalarization"" for scalar time consistency that corroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi-objective problems (Karnam, Ma, and Zhang (2017), Kovacova and Rudloff (2021)).",,,,,Multivariate statistics; Time consistency; Scalar (mathematics); Consistency (knowledge bases); Econometrics; Mathematics; Transaction cost; Actuarial science; Computer science; Mathematical economics; Risk analysis (engineering); Economics; Statistics; Medicine; Discrete mathematics; Finance; Geometry,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1810.04978,,10.48550/arxiv.1810.04978,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

We argue that the impact of credit default swap markets on fi nancial stability crucially depends on clearing mechanisms and capital and liquidity requirements for large protection sellers. In particular, the culprits are not so much speculative or ""naked"" credit default swaps but inadequate risk management and supervision of protection sellers. When protection sellers are inadequately capitalised, OTC (over-the-counter) CDS markets may act as channels for contagion and systemic risk. On the other hand, a CDS market where all major dealers participate in a central clearing facility with adequate reserves can actually contribute to mitigating systemic risk. In the latter case, a key element is the risk management of the central counterparties, for which we outline some recommendations.",,,,,Clearing; Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Element (criminal law); Credit default swap; Risk management; Financial system; Capital (economics),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-00545742.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:journl:hal-00545742,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-00545742.html,,,3124660006,,0,,21,False,,,lens

Michalis; Peter Stone; Ik-Kyung Jang,"Background— Despite the exposure of the entire vasculature to the atherogenic effects of systemic risk factors, atherosclerotic plaques preferentially develop at sites with disturbed flow. This study aimed at exploring in vivo the relationship between local endothelial shear stress (ESS) and coronary plaque characteristics in humans using computational fluid dynamics and frequency-domain optical coherence tomography.; ; Methods and Results— Three-dimensional coronary artery reconstruction was performed in 21 patients (24 arteries) presenting with acute coronary syndrome using frequency-domain optical coherence tomography and coronary angiography. Each coronary artery was divided into sequential 3-mm segments and analyzed for the assessment of local ESS and plaque characteristics. A total of 146 nonculprit segments were evaluated. Compared with segments with higher ESS [≥1 Pascal (Pa)], those with low ESS (<1 Pa) showed higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaques (37.5% versus 20.0%; P =0.019) and thin-cap fibroatheroma (12.5% versus 2.0%; P =0.037). Overall, lipid plaques in segments with low ESS had thinner fibrous cap (115 μm [63–166] versus 170 μm [107–219]; P =0.004) and higher macrophage density (normalized standard deviation: 8.4% [4.8–12.6] versus 6.2% [4.2–8.8]; P =0.017). Segments with low ESS showed more superficial calcifications (minimum calcification depth: 93 μm [50–140] versus 152 μm [105–258]; P =0.049) and tended to have higher prevalence of spotty calcifications (26.0% versus 12.0%; P =0.076).; ; Conclusions— Coronary regions exposed to low ESS are associated with larger lipid burden, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma in humans.

Tolliver‐Lynn; Alvina M. Marris; Maureen A. Sullivan; Mira Armans,"Resilience is a key characteristic to study in families, particularly those who have experienced significant systemic risk factors. While much resilience research focuses on ethnic and cultural minorities, little research focuses specifically on American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) families. The parent-child relationship has been demonstrated to be a key characteristic in families, and this relationship may also serve as a protective factor for AI/AN families. Positive parent-child relationships are consistently linked to positive child outcomes, and parental psychological symptoms are linked with child psychological symptoms in non-Native families. These associations warrant further examination among AI/AN families. We hypothesized that the parent-child relationship would moderate the link between parent distress (i.e., depressive and anxious symptoms) and child internalizing problems in a sample of 57 AI/AN parents of children 3-5 years of age.

Brovko,"<jats:p>The study’s relevance is determined by the significant impact that digitalization has on the economic and social activities of modern states, which engenders new risks and threats to the functioning of va­rious systems and institutions. Based on the evolutionary-institutional analysis and systems analysis methods, the study identifies the threats of digitalization and the associated macroeconomic risks and describes the current approaches to digital risk management. The evolution in the understanding of risk and contemporary approaches to risk assessment is traced in relation to business, social, economic, investment, military, and political threats. Among the critical risks of digitalization, an important place is occupied by cyber risks, which are part of the strategic risks of enterprises, credit risks and regulatory risks. These risks affect markets and create a systemic risk stemming from the possible damage to elements of the infrastructure and market. Technology-driven risks have a systemic character as they may affect more than one country, economic sector, as well as a wide range of natural, technological, and social systems. The study offers an analysis of digitalization risk assessment methods (STRIDE, CIA, OCTAVE) and provides an overview of the qualitative and quantitative methods used to assess digital threats. Modern approaches to cyber risk management include modeling threats and vulnerabilities. These methods may prove especially useful to identify, classify and prioritize threats and to develop selective risk reduction measures. The concepts of FinTech and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) are discussed in relation to the associated risks to the stability of national and international financial systems. The study also considers the concept of e-government, the stages of the evolution of e-government characterized by different risks to systems of public administration.</jats:p>",20,1,216,245,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31063/altereconomics/2023.20-1.11,,10.31063/altereconomics/2023.20-1.11,,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Gorman,"<jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> Xiaoqing Jing, Jinhong Xie “Did you see the deal on Groupon?” is a question that can now be heard around the water cooler as Group Buying gains in popularity. A relatively new and unique Internet-enabled selling strategy, Group Buying provides consumers a discounted group price if they achieve a required group size and coordinate their transaction time. The authors suggest that Group Buying allows a seller to gain from facilitating consumer social interaction, i.e., using a group discount to motivate informed customers to work as “sales agents” to acquire less-informed customers through interpersonal information/knowledge sharing. Group Buying is more profitable than traditional individual-selling strategies when the information gap between expert and novice consumers is neither too high nor too low (e.g., for products in the midstage of their life cycle) and when interpersonal information sharing is very efficient. The authors also show that, unlike Referral Rewards programs, Group Buying requires information sharing before any transaction takes place, thereby increasing the scale of social interaction but also incurring a higher cost. The insight for management: Group Buying is optimal when interpersonal communication is very efficient or when the product valuation of the less-informed consumer segment is high. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> Erik Brynjolfsson, Yu (Jeffrey) Hu, Duncan Simester How does the Internet affect the relative profitability of “best sellers” and “niche products”? Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of best-selling products. The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of niche products, thereby creating the Internet's “long tail” phenomenon: Niche products have a rising proportion of total sales. The authors analyze data collected from a multichannel retailer and show that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional channels. The authors find that consumers' usage of Internet search and discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, is associated with an increase in the share of niche products. They conclude that this shift may partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. For example, why would listeners rely on Billboard's “top 40” when they can sample thousands of songs almost costlessly? The insight for management: If these trends in technology persist, they portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales as niche products become less niche. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> Kay Giesecke, Baeho Kim In diversified financial markets and economies, the probability of widespread independent defaults is low. However, the 2007–2009 financial crisis shows us that the interconnectedness of financial markets can lead to systemic risk. The authors develop dynamic measures of the systemic risk of the financial sector as a whole. They define systemic risk as the conditional probability of failure of a sufficiently large fraction of the total population of financial institutions. This definition recognizes that the cause of systemic distress is the correlated failure of institutions to meet obligations to creditors, customers, and trading partners. Their measures provide accurate out-of-sample forecasts of the term structure of systemic risk in the United States for the period from 1998 to 2009. The insight for management: Financial risk models should incorporate both individual institutional risk and systemic risk to buffer institutions against future uncertainties. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> Turan G. Bali, Nusret Cakici, Fousseni Chabi-Yo This paper proposes a generalized measure of riskiness that nests original measures pioneered in 2008. The authors introduce the generalized options' implied measure of riskiness based on the risk-neutral return distribution of financial securities. The authors provide asset allocation implications and show that the forward-looking measures of riskiness successfully predict the cross section of 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month-ahead risk-adjusted returns of individual stocks. The insight for management: The generalized measure of riskiness is able to rank equity portfolios based on their expected returns per unit of risk and hence yields a more efficient strategy for maximizing expected return of the portfolio while minimizing its risk. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> Anil Arya, Brian Mittendorf If an executive is rewarded for “putting out fires,” does that create an incentive to become a corporate arsonist? Many individuals' performance incentives are driven by a desire to shape external perceptions (and thus future pay). But smooth sailing gets less attention for the individual executive than does recovery from a tsunami. The authors find that when individuals' actions are driven by career incentives, an aggregate measure (e.g., group or team output) can sometimes alleviate moral hazard concerns and improve efficiency. The reason is this: Aggregation intermingles the contribution to performance of skill and effort. The entanglement increases the prospect that the market will attribute an employee's effort-driven contribution to transferable skills, so the employee exerts greater effort as a means of posturing to the market. Of course, the incentive benefit of aggregation must be weighed against the incentive cost because of information loss. Information loss from aggregation can reduce the market's reliance on the measure and thus diminish agents' desire to undertake effort to influence the measure. The insight for management: Individual measures of performance may be direct but may introduce some incentives for malfeasance that can be mitigated by aggregate measures. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> René Aïd, Gilles Chemla, Arnaud Porchet, Nizar Touzi How do vertical integration and forward markets affect energy markets? Forward markets and vertical integration are two mechanisms commonly used for demand and spot price risk diversification, but what is their impact on prices, risk premia, and retail market shares? The authors illustrate how these two strategies affect the French electricity market. They find that forward hedging and vertical integration both reduce the retail price and increase retail market shares. On the other hand, vertical integration restores the symmetry between producers' and retailers' exposure to demand risk, whereas linear forward contracts do not. The insight for management: Both mechanisms reduce price and increase market share, but vertical integration is superior to forward hedging when retailers are highly risk averse. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> René Carmona, Juri Hinz How should call options on futures contracts be priced on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions allowances?

Simcoe Are the attitudes and beliefs of CEOs linked to their firms' innovative performance? CEOs often innovate to provide evidence of their ability. Overconfident CEOs, who underestimate the probability of failure, are more likely to pursue innovation. The authors examine CEO stock options exercised from publicly traded firms between 1980 and 1994 to study the relationship between a CEO's “revealed beliefs” about future performance and various measures of corporate innovation such as new patent creation. The authors show a positive association between overconfidence and citation-weighted patent counts. This effect is larger in more competitive industries. The insight for management: Overconfident CEOs are more likely to take their firms in a new technological direction. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title /><jats:p> Nikolay Archak, Anindya Ghose, Panagiotis G. Ipeirotis User reviews of products such as digital cameras proliferate on Amazon.com and other websites. Such user-generated product reviews serve as a valuable source of information for customers making product choices online. But how can this highly unstructured data be used efficiently to increase sales and profits? Of course, the “number of stars” and the number of reviews are indicators, but the information embedded in product reviews is much richer and more detailed. Clearly a review is subjective and multifaceted (picture quality, compactness, ease of use, etc.), and the textual content of product reviews is critical to subsequent consumer choices. The authors use text mining to incorporate review text from 15 months of reviews on digital cameras and camcorders on Amazon.com. Because free-form text is messy, the authors clustered rare textual opinions based on mutual information and used expert opinion on the review semantics. The authors predict product popularity based on quantification of the information provided in the textual reviews. The insight for management: Textual data can be used to learn consumers' preferences for different product features and can be used for predicting future changes in sales. </jats:p></jats:sec>",57,8,iv,vi,Business; Computer science; Process management,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1423,,10.1287/mnsc.1110.1423,,,0,,0,True,,bronze,lens

Although central clearing has been widely implemented, it has reproduced many of the same characteristics of financial markets that contributed to the 2008 crisis: concentrated risk, moral hazard, and a reliance on faulty risk models. What accounts for the recalcitrance of the OTC derivatives market to a regulatory change? The chapter argues that focusing on the technologies and practices used to govern derivatives markets helps explain the absence of more radical regulatory policy shifts in derivatives regulation. Although there has been a significant shift in who regulates OTC markets, much less has changed at the level of the specific practices that govern these markets, and the chapter examines the continued reliance on netting, collateralization, and risk modeling within clearinghouses.</p>",,,,,Clearing; Business; Market economy; Politics; Derivatives market,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190864576.003.0007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190864576.003.0007,,10.1093/oso/9780190864576.003.0007,2790120872,,0,,1,False,,,lens

In the context of pricing cyber insurance policies, issues of interdependence arise for both systematic and systemic cyber risks; classical actuarial valuation needs to be extended to include more complex methods, such as concepts of risk-neutral valuation and (set-valued) monetary risk measures.",,,,,Valuation (finance); Systemic risk; Systematic risk; Actuarial science; Context (archaeology); Business; Systematic review; Risk management; Risk analysis (engineering); Economics; Financial crisis; Finance; MEDLINE; Political science; Law; Paleontology; Biology; Macroeconomics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2209.07415,,10.48550/arxiv.2209.07415,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

051-635-840-011-984,Essays on Financial Regulation in Macroeconomics,,2012.0,dissertation,,,,,Julien Bengui,"Title of dissertation: ESSAYS ON FINANCIAL REGULATION IN MACROECONOMICS Julien Yonathan Bengui, Doctor of Philosophy, 2012 Dissertation directed by: Professor Anton Korinek and Professor Enrique G. Mendoza Department of Economics This dissertation investigates two aspects of how to regulate the financial sector optimally in order to increase macroeconomic stability and mitigate the risk of future financial crises. Chapter 1 analyzes the desirability of international coordination in financial regulation. It develops a two-country model of systemic liquidity risk-taking in which financial market imperfections provide a rationale for macro-prudential regulation. In the model, curbing liquidity risk-taking via regulation lowers the price of liquidity during financial crises and thereby reduces the costs associated with market incompleteness. But regulation also entails costs in the form of distortions to productive investment decisions. The discrepancy between the domestic dimension of the costs and the global dimension of the benefits of regulation generates free-riding incentives among regulators operating in different countries. The theory predicts that absent international coordination, national authorities are tempted to regulate their financial systems in a way that results in excessive illiquidity. It therefore speaks in favor of a stronger global coordination of banking regulation. Chapter 2 analyzes the social optimality of private debt maturity choices. It studies debt maturity decisions in a dynamic macroeconomic model in which financial frictions give rise to systemic risk in the form of amplification effects. Long-term liabilities provide insurance against shocks to the asset side of the balance sheet, but they come at an extra cost. The debt maturity structure therefore maps into an allocation of macroeconomic risk between lenders and leveraged borrowers, and fundamental shocks propagate more powerfully in the economy when the maturity is shorter. The market equilibrium is not constrained efficient as borrowers fail to internalize their contribution to systemic risk and take on too much short-term debt in a decentralized economy. The theory indicates that a tax on short-term debt – a form of macroprudential policy – leads to Pareto improvements and results in less volatile allocations and asset prices.

And yet, in this article, we show that default risk has a bigger impact on equity values than it does on bond values.; Our work is based on a default intensity model that we extrapolate to equities. This model does not presuppose a particular method for estimating distance to default. As a result, unlike Merton structural models, which only apply to indebted companies, it can be used to assess default risk for any company.; Highlighting a default risk premium in the cost of capital calculation makes it possible to reconcile the CAPM with evaluation methods based on forecasts in the event of survival. At the same time, the CAPM and default risk can explain the vast majority of bond spreads.; The test consisting of estimating “physical” implied default probabilities and the share of systemic risk included in corporate euro bond spreads at end-2015 led us to detect the likely existence of excessive remuneration of investment grade bonds. This finding corroborates identical conclusions reached earlier by other researchers. This potential market anomaly could indicate a windfall for investors. Performing this test again at various points in the economic and financial cycle would help establish whether the bond market is serving a free lunch to investors not bound by regulatory reserve requirements.",,,,,Financial economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Capital asset pricing model; Bond market; Cost of equity; Bond; Cost of capital; Systematic risk,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/85659.html https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/85659/,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/85659.html,,,2796198971,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Using Bayesian techniques, we estimate an asymmetric two-country DSGE model that allows for cross-border loan facilities where monetary and macroprudential policies can play a role in mitigating the risk of the financial system. We divide the dataset of the Euro Area between core and peripheral countries to take into account the recent structural divergences of business and credit cycles. First, introducing macroprudential policy clearly increases welfare from 0.004% and 0.376% of unconditional consumption. Greater welfare gains are observed for the coordination scheme with national implementation. Second, cross-border loans are not a critical feature to assess the systemic risk at the national level. Finally concerning the interactions between monetary and macroprudential policy, we find that the implementation of monetary policy should only aim to maintain price stability in the Eurosystem: the financial and price stability mandates should remain separated.",,,,,Welfare; Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Economics; Price of stability; Banking union; Loan; Financial accelerator; Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium; Monetary economics,,,,,,,,,594236697,,0,003-569-815-235-798; 010-554-340-662-375; 011-875-725-336-128; 029-043-831-307-015; 040-524-972-023-230; 043-537-799-993-736; 043-654-363-216-517; 043-727-189-255-290; 045-807-863-208-027; 049-847-145-086-696; 067-623-360-712-290; 068-535-657-306-142; 075-815-351-103-959; 076-392-953-888-903; 078-712-100-682-666; 079-805-388-248-314; 084-948-620-843-679; 124-632-692-866-51X; 125-858-241-963-423; 126-055-910-636-962; 127-703-945-173-565; 133-618-882-200-079; 139-044-800-498-472; 147-961-528-896-014; 167-759-845-373-117; 174-694-121-077-784; 184-805-537-816-693; 186-465-578-111-715; 196-139-919-676-984,1,False,,,lens

Curt Hunter; David A. Marshall,"This paper critically reviews the literature examining the role of central banks in addressing systemic risk. We focus on how the growth in derivatives markets might affect that role. Analysis of systemic risk policy is hampered by the lack of a consensus theory of systemic risk. We propose a set of criteria that theories of systemic risk should satisfy, and we critically discuss a number of theories proposed in the literature. We argue that concerns about systemic effects of derivatives appear somewhat overstated. In particular, derivative markets do not appear unduly prone to systemic disturbances. Furthermore, derivative trading may increase informational efficiency of financial markets and provide instruments for more effective risk management. Both of these effects tend to reduce the danger of systemic crises. However, the complexity of derivative contracts (in particular, their high implicit leverage and nonlinear payoffs) do complicate the process of regulatory oversight. In addition, derivatives may make the conduct of monetary policy more difficult. Most theories of systemic risk imply a critical role for central banks as the ultimate provider of liquidity.

In this paper we examine the reliability and robustness of such risk measures, focusing on CoVaR, marginal expected shortfall, and option-based tail risk estimates. We show that CoVaR exhibits undesired characteristics in the way it responds to idiosyncratic risk. In the presence of contagion, the risk measures provide conflicting signals on the systemic risk of infectious and infected banks. Finally, we explore how limited data availability typical of practical applications may limit the measures' performance. We generate systemic tail risk through positions in standard index options and describe situations in which systemic risk is misestimated by the three measures. The observations raise doubts about the informativeness of the proposed measures. In particular, a direct application to regulatory capital surcharges for systemic risk could create wrong incentives for banks.",,,,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Tail risk; Robustness (economics); Index (economics); Capital requirement; Incentive; Expected shortfall; Systematic risk,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:bubdps:042013 https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/bubdps/042013.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:bubdps:042013,,,3124260395,,0,,16,False,,,lens

In contrast to the previous trading models based on random matching or exogenous networks, we allow traders to explicitly choose their trading partners as well as the number of trading links in a dynamic framework. We show that traders with higher trading needs optimally choose to match with traders with lower needs for trade and they build fewer links in equilibrium. As a result, traders with the least trading need turn out to be the most connected and have the highest gross trade volume. The model therefore endogenously generates a core-periphery trading network that we often observe: a financial architecture that involves a small number of large, interconnected institutions.

Kaufman,"In the U.S., as in most countries with well-developed securities markets, derivative securities enjoy special protections under insolvency resolution laws. Most creditors are ""stayed"" from enforcing their rights while a firm is in bankruptcy. However, many derivatives contracts are exempt from these stays. Furthermore, derivatives enjoy netting and close-out, or termination, privileges which are not always available to most other creditors. The primary argument used to motivate passage of legislation granting these extraordinary protections is that derivatives markets are a major source of systemic risk in financial markets and that netting and close-out reduce this risk. To date, these assertions have not been subjected to rigorous economic scrutiny. This paper critically reexamines this hypothesis. These relationships are more complex than often perceived. We conclude that it is not clear whether netting, collateral, and/or close-out lead to reduced systemic risk, once the impact of these protections on the size and structure of the derivatives market has been taken into account.",,,,,Finance; Derivative (finance); Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Collateral; Netting; Insolvency; Bankruptcy; Financial system; Derivatives market,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=730648 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID730648_code379856.pdf?abstractid=730648&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=730648,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.730648,,10.2139/ssrn.730648,2115132126,,0,000-641-079-364-691; 002-595-065-089-092; 023-531-691-127-93X; 024-351-190-580-451; 030-063-698-161-451; 034-233-045-058-910; 043-138-576-437-312; 043-342-896-174-118; 046-169-328-895-892; 075-897-862-903-52X; 084-706-035-314-918; 089-597-401-024-139; 095-521-575-398-292; 108-250-967-808-025; 112-031-931-589-187; 113-616-282-590-646; 155-824-577-078-420; 164-753-602-753-469; 173-969-065-811-772; 191-813-833-346-431,23,True,,green,lens

029-829-465-102-574,CIFEr - Impact of credit default swaps on financial contagion,,2014.0,conference proceedings article,2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr),,IEEE,,Yoshiharu Maeno; Satoshi Morinaga; Kenji Nishiguchi; Hirokazu Matsushima,It had been believed in the conventional practice that the risk of a bank going bankrupt is lessened in a straightforward manner by transferring the risk of loan defaults. But the failure of American International Group in 2008 posed a more complex aspect of financial contagion. This study presents an extension of the asset network systemic risk model (ANWSER) to investigate whether credit default swaps mitigate or intensify the severity of financial contagion. A protection buyer bank transfers the risk of every possible debtor bank default to protection seller banks. The empirical distribution of the number of bank bankruptcies is obtained with the extended model. Systemic capital buffer ratio is calculated from the distribution. The ratio quantifies the effective loss absorbency capability of the entire financial system to force back financial contagion. The key finding is that the leverage ratio is a good estimate of a systemic capital buffer ratio as the backstop of a financial system. The risk transfer from small and medium banks to big banks in an interbank network does not mitigate the severity of financial contagion.,,,152,157,Systemic risk; Economics; Financial contagion; Interbank network; Debtor; Electronic mail; Credit default swap; Default; Financial system; Financial risk; Business; Asset (economics); Loan; Monetary economics,,,,,https://meiji.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/impact-of-credit-default-swaps-on-financial-contagion https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6924067/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1411.html#MaenoNMM14a http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1356,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cifer.2014.6924067,,10.1109/cifer.2014.6924067,2066990252; 3105064221,,0,003-803-424-332-155; 007-215-413-735-324; 007-335-165-078-455; 013-550-091-544-773; 014-376-299-796-844; 016-908-482-410-847; 022-465-590-461-470; 023-354-291-918-017; 025-303-272-106-219; 035-821-379-237-107; 055-524-357-166-744; 056-025-953-608-887; 058-879-947-933-394; 059-934-099-107-836; 062-665-995-202-765; 076-660-734-865-574; 077-436-811-650-375; 086-913-430-474-676; 096-169-731-559-884; 109-381-535-599-334; 119-311-812-026-438; 123-699-515-895-205; 140-499-268-375-017; 146-286-609-813-716; 149-345-108-338-458; 154-826-170-461-623,0,True,,green,lens

Dacorogna; Marie Kratz,"Risk diversification is the basis of insurance and investment. It is thus crucial to study the effects that could limit it. One of them is the existence of systemic risk that affects all the policies at the same time. We introduce here a probabilistic approach to examine the consequences of its presence on the risk loading of the premium of a portfolio of insurance policies. This approach could be easily generalized for investment risk. We see that, even with a small probability of occurrence, systemic risk can reduce dramatically the diversification benefits. It is clearly revealed via a non-diversifiable term that appears in the analytical expression of the variance of our models. We propose two ways of introducing it and discuss their advantages and limitations. By using both VaR and TVaR to compute the loading, we see that only the latter captures the full effect of systemic risk when its probability to occur is low.",,,,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Diversification (finance); Portfolio; Risk measure; Risk management; Expected shortfall; Financial risk; Value at risk,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1312.0506.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1312.0506,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1312.0506.html,,,3124830265,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Desde a crise que se iniciou com os \""subprimes\"" nos Estados Unidos em 2008 e se espalhou para as economias de todo o mundo, novas discussões de como ela poderia ter sido evitada e qual caminho deveriam os países seguir para sair da estagnação já surgem no mundo acadêmico em direção ao estudo da complexidade. Em termos econômicos, algumas críticas feitas ao estudo da economia tradicional, principalmente atribuídas ao excesso de restrições utilizados nos modelos, podem ser agora afrouxadas, uma a uma, através de modelagens baseadas em agentes. Já no entendimento e controle do risco financeiro, redes complexas prestam fundamental distinção. Os modelos até então utilizados para controle de riscos no mercado financeiro não levam em consideração o risco global, porém apenas o risco local. Muitas teorias sobre a diminuição do risco através da diversificação são aceitas e realmente produzem sistemas mais estáveis, porém com pouca resiliência, ou seja, o número de crises diminui, porém as que ocorrem são muito mais graves. Este trabalho sugeriu um modelo baseado em agentes, onde um sistema econômico simples foi construído, para ser capaz de gerar crises. Este modelo formado por firmas e demanda estocástica, utiliza bancos para simular o mercado financeiro. Tais bancos estão conectados entre si através de uma rede interbancária. Para testar os efeitos de risco sistêmico, foram realizados três testes. No primeiro aumentou-se a alavancagem máxima permitida e os bancos conseguiram obter mais lucro e maior crescimento, porém a partir de certo patamar o sistema entrou em colapso, com frequente crises. No segundo aumentou-se a conectividade média e os bancos também obtiveram maior lucro, porém com crises muito mais profundas. No aumento do índice de cluster da rede interbancária, assim como nos dois primeiros testes os bancos conseguiram maior crescimento, porém agora sem os mesmos efeitos indesejáveis causados pelo aumento do risco.Economic and financial studies have been changing and searching new methodologies. Since the 2008 subprime crisis, which spread into economies around the globe, new discussions on how it could have been prevented, and paths which countries should follow to emerge from stagflation have been discussed by the academic world towards the complexity subject. In economic terms, some of the criticism of neoclassic economics, mainly due to excessive constrains used by its models, can now be eased, one by one, through agent based modeling. Regarding financial risk understanding and control, complex networks assume fundamental distinction. Models applied so far in financial market risk control dont consider global risk, but only the local one. Many theories on risk diversification are accepted and indeed produce more stable systems, although with little resilience, which means smaller number of crisis, but when it does occur, are more serious ones. This paper suggested an agent based model, using a simple economic system capable of generating crisis. This model was constituted by firms and stochastic demand, using banks to simulate the financial market. These banks were connected though a banking network. In order to test systemic risk, the model performed three tests. First, the maximum leverage allowed was increased and banks were able to achieve higher profits and growth, but from a certain level, the system collapsed with frequent crisis. Second, the average connectivity was increased and banks obtained higher profits, however with more severe crisis. Finally, increasing banking network cluster index, similarly to the first two tests, banks achieved higher growth, but without the undesirable effects caused by risk increase",,,,,,,,,,https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/100/100132/tde-05012016-225818/ https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/100/100132/tde-05012016-225818/publico/Dissertacao_Eduardo_de_Souza_Dias_corrigida.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/d.100.2016.tde-05012016-225818,,10.11606/d.100.2016.tde-05012016-225818,2282170954,,0,,0,True,cc-by-nc-sa,gold,lens

First, contrary to the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, market prices of financial assets do not reflect “correct” prices based on current information, but market actors acquire financial assets on the shared expectation they will rise (Minsky 1986). This leads to waves of excessive credit creation in the economy and the mispricing of financial risk. Second, market actors do not act on the basis of “rational expectations,” but on the basis of “intersubjective expectations.” They look to one another for signals regarding how to react to market events. When their intersubjectively shared social understandings are disappointed, they can panic and freeze, generating enormous market volatility in search for a new “equilibrium” (Hall 2008). Third, since financial market behavior is performative rather than reflective of exogenously functioning market processes, this perfomativity amplifies market volatility and destructive mass-market behavior. We are now bearing the consequences of our misconceptions about how basic processes of market rationality actually operate.; ; Much of the difficulty in which we presently find ourselves may be traced to the belief by actors in the financial markets, and by central bankers with supervisory responsibility for the financial system, that financial markets behave in accordance with the Efficient Markets Hypothesis of neoclassical economics.

The study is unique in the sense that CBRT's monetary policy reaction function is augmented with a distinctive financial stress index, i.e. the composite index of systemic stress (CISS). The index pays special attention to the systemic risk component of financial markets by taking into account the cross-correlations between financial market segments. The responsiveness of the CBRT to financial stress is measured by a generic policy interest rate, comprising of the overnight rate, BIST interbank rate and weighted average funding rate. CBRT has publicly announced the change in its policy framework as a response to heightened financial stability concerns after the third quarter of 2010. This study aims to look whether the CBRT's response to financial systemic stress has really changed or not after 2010 by carrying out a subsample regression analysis. The results are further crosschecked with rolling window and interaction dummy regression analysis. The empirical results collected from these econometric exercises indicate that the CBRT's monetary policy was leaning more against financial stress after mid-2010 compared to the previous period.",16,4,143,150,Monetary policy; Macroeconomics; Systemic risk; Economics; Interbank lending market; Interest rate; Financial market; Composite index; Monetary policy reaction function; Overnight rate; Monetary economics,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:tcb:cebare:v:16:y:2016:i:4:p:143-150 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070116300312 https://core.ac.uk/display/151105685 https://ideas.repec.org/a/tcb/cebare/v16y2016i4p143-150.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbrev.2016.11.003,,10.1016/j.cbrev.2016.11.003,2562480029,,0,000-304-929-649-558; 008-323-799-170-366; 010-092-425-623-742; 010-314-531-841-314; 041-383-051-582-230; 048-332-187-830-533; 050-582-026-508-109; 058-141-538-292-636; 061-343-613-711-882; 070-983-023-571-308; 075-358-686-087-902; 089-026-642-855-76X; 101-215-847-469-438; 104-886-492-734-525; 109-341-167-101-865; 117-221-789-992-512; 124-801-464-924-209; 136-464-609-195-985; 154-109-207-580-932; 161-148-627-366-188; 167-916-452-423-677; 175-250-623-605-371; 180-909-177-447-206; 187-644-701-670-783; 194-306-764-870-311,12,True,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold,lens

We see both costs and benefits from these developments in the cross-border bank exposures.

018-892-260-236-66X,Towards Sovereign Equity,2016-01-01,2016.0,,,,,,Stephen Park; Tim R Samples,"IntroductionSovereign finance is at a crossroads, facing both new challenges and opportunities. Ongoing sovereign debt crises in Europe have spurred fears worldwide. During the summer of 2015, Greece's crisis threatened to unravel the Eurozone, the monetary union that lies at the heart of the European Union.1 Ukraine is grappling with a debt crisis exacerbated by political upheaval and armed conflict.2 In 2014, Argentina entered into another chaotic default following a series of controversial decisions by U.S. courts and years of bitter holdout litigation.3 Sovereign finance is plagued by unique problems, which pose systemic risks to the global economy and serious problems for investors, governments, and ordinary citizens alike.4 The need for innovation in sovereign debt is greater than ever. This Article considers whether innovation towards sovereign equity could help mitigate problems associated with sovereign debt crises.5Sovereign finance stands alone in the global financial system. Sovereign debt markets operate in a legal and regulatory void, largely free from direct regulatory or legal authority.6 As a result, sovereign debt is a unique experiment in contract design with particular challenges as well as opportunities.7 As bond issuers, sovereigns are subject to certain special requirements under domestic securities law and are able to invoke special defenses that limit their liability.8 While the doctrine of restrictive sovereign immunity permits private actions against sovereign issuers, judicial enforcement is inconsistent and often ineffective.9 Governments as debtors are not subject to domestic bankruptcy laws, and despite periodic efforts over the past couple of decades, there is no supranational insolvency regime for sovereigns.10 Despite the concerns implicated by Argentina, Greece, Ukraine, and other highly-indebted countries, political prospects of a supranational insolvency regime or a comprehensive regulatory framework for sovereign finance remain dim and highly speculative.Governments - unlike corporations-do not issue equity stock and therefore rely primarily on fixed income bonds to externally finance their investments and operations.11 While investors can own government assets (such as through privatization of state-owned enterprises), one cannot invest in the equity of a country. This limits and distorts a sovereign's financing options as debt, unlike equity, must at some point be repaid at a fixed interest rate.12 In recent years, however, several countries have issued GDP-linked securities, which provide interest payments indexed to the sovereign issuer's rate of growth. Sovereign equity, in this modified and limited form, has played a key role in two of the most important sovereign restructurings in modern history: Argentina and Greece.13 Sovereign equity has been portrayed as a long-term solution to the Greek debt crisis.14 More recently, GDP-linked securities have been incorporated as an integral part of Ukraine's proposed debt restructuring.15 While the viability of these proposals remains to be seen, in this time of instability and uncertainty in the sovereign debt markets, sovereign equity merits consideration as a means for financial innovation. Although academic economists, central banks, and international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have extensively explored the concept of sovereign equity,16 this issue has received relatively little attention from legal scholars.This Article aspires to rectify this gap in legal scholarship by exploring the doctrinal, institutional design, and normative implications of sovereign equity. State contingent debt instruments, such as GDP-linked securities, facilitate risk-sharing between sovereign debtors and private creditors by expressly linking interest payments to macroeconomic variables.17 Numerous economic studies identify how GDP-linked securities can help reduce the risk of sovereign default and propose pricing frameworks for GDP-linked securities to account for the effects of varied and dynamic macroeconomic conditions. …",21,2,240,,Fixed income; Debt; Sovereign immunity; Business; State (polity); Sovereign default; Debt crisis; Insolvency; Bond; Financial system,,,,,http://works.bepress.com/tim_samples/5/,http://works.bepress.com/tim_samples/5/,,,3124959372,,0,,3,False,,,lens

Bail-in allows to internalize the costs of bank failures instead of imposing externalities upon the rest of society through public bailouts. The final objective of the bail-in tool is then to encourage bank creditors to be more selective in their investment decisions and to take fully into account the adequacy of the bank's capital reserves to the desired level of business risk. The decision of the European legislator to apply bail-in to total liabilities instead of risk-weighted assets (as in the Basel III/CRD IV framework) should facilitate market oversight over the level of capital and bailinable liabilities for each bank. The BRRD and the SRM Regulation provide that the bail-in tool may be applied either in order to recapitalize a bank or banking group and restructure it as a going concern, or to provide capital either for setting up a bridge bank, transferring the business to a third party or setting up an asset management vehicle. Certain liabilities may be exempted from the application of the bail-in tool if systemic risks would ensue. As the bail-in tool enables the authorities to restructure and recapitalize a bank without having to immediately separate the bank's critical functions from the non-viable part of the business, it is the resolution tool most likely to be used for large, complex and highly interconnected financial institutions, As it has been observed by some qualified commentators, for the largest banks systemic risks might emerge already for relatively limited levels of losses. Besides, presently the bailinable liabilities are largely held by creditors who made their investment ahead of the present legislation. Our study shows that in some EU Member States the average capitalization level for some of the largest banks is such that it would be necessary to apply the bail-in to a relatively high volumes of senior unsecured debt and other liabilities before the intervention of the Single Resolution Fund. Our study also shows that the bailinable liabilities with remaining maturity of at least one year – those that represent the most solid basis for bail-in – in some cases are lower than 15% of the total liabilities.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Banking union; Bridge bank; Single Resolution Mechanism; Basel III; Bank rate; Official cash rate; Financial system; Chinese financial system,,,,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2714757 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2714757,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2714757,,,2238904512,,0,,0,False,,,lens

A puzzling fact is the existence of widespread over-compliance of banks regarding national and international regulatory capital requirements. Some light is shed on this pattern by studying bank capitalization decisions using 1,267 banks from twenty-nine OECD countries. The effect of market pressure (competition) on bank capitalization is found to be positive, whereas the direct effect of regulation is ambiguous. Three points can be made. First, the effectiveness of regulation must be evaluated taking into account the – often overlooked – indirect effects. Secondly, the impact of regulation can be amplified by competitive forces when there are synergies between regulatory and market pressures. Such synergies seem to have played a key role in the widespread adoption and effectiveness of international regulatory capital requirements (the Basle Accord). And thirdly, the prospects for international regulatory convergence in any area are influenced by the interconnectedness (synergies vs. rivalries) between regulatory and market processes.",36,03,509,525,Business; Systemic risk; International economics; Convergence (economics); Capitalization; Competition (economics); Capital requirement; Oecd countries; Regulatory policy; Interconnectedness,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cup/bjposi/v36y2006i03p509-525_00.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cup:bjposi:v:36:y:2006:i:03:p:509-525_00 http://www.cis.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/cis-dam/CIS_DAM_2015/WorkingPapers/WP_2005/2005_WP05_Bernauer_Koubi.pdf https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0007123406000263 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/on-the-interconnectedness-of-regulatory-policy-and-markets-lessons-from-banking/0AC115889B2A11BCBFCE6ACCAB60325D https://www.cis.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/cis-dam/CIS_DAM_2015/WorkingPapers/WP_2005/2005_WP05_Bernauer_Koubi.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/info/4092260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0007123406000263,,10.1017/s0007123406000263,2107450424,,0,003-025-422-339-881; 010-933-217-930-581; 021-027-031-155-817; 026-441-432-537-942; 033-671-216-534-410; 035-002-500-157-952; 037-303-143-949-143; 038-591-287-877-463; 040-531-566-689-139; 042-206-620-337-868; 043-786-091-359-956; 044-644-307-135-373; 059-260-806-593-258; 059-872-092-879-787; 078-263-790-045-371; 088-781-745-633-409; 106-833-462-408-941; 127-189-200-724-650; 132-314-232-662-897; 141-718-668-290-665; 141-735-814-884-686; 147-534-512-677-873; 148-839-556-783-022; 159-465-056-004-024,11,True,,green,lens
100-435-287-253-951,CBI (2) - Managing Regulatory System with Megamodelling,,2018.0,conference proceedings article,2018 IEEE 20th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI),,IEEE,,Jean-Sébastien Sottet; Eric Grandry; Marija Bjekovic,"Digital transformation accelerates the development of business ecosystems, and leads to increasing cross-domain and cross-sectoral business interconnections. While the regulatory environment is traditionally managed within fragmented sectoral silos, integrating those increasing business interconnections causes the introduction of cross-market domain regulations and multi-sectoral obligations to regulate such ecosystems. The above-mentioned developments challenge already established regulatory practices and create necessity to manage the emergence of cross-market systemic risks and control their propagation and more importantly help regulatory bodies in their policy making. Managing interconnected risks requires to break regulation silos while integrating the perspectives of all actors. In this paper, we propose an approach and an architecture to support risk-based policy cycle within regulatory system. The approach is centred on the principles of megamodelling, and in particular the concept of Regulatory megamodel. While megamodel is intended to allow for and manage a macroscopic view over the regulatory system, with all its complexities, it also accommodates individual actors to gain insight into locally relevant concerns, however not ignoring cross-domain and cross-market implications and dependencies. This is expected to facilitate compliance reporting, control processes and monitoring for the actors involved. In particular, we believe the major potential of such an approach lies in allowing regulator(s) to gain insights when it comes to cost-effective policy making, and to optimising the entire policy cycle.",,,1,10,Risk analysis (engineering); Architecture; Digital transformation; Business; Systemic risk; Business ecosystem; Control (management); Policy making; Risk management; Model-driven architecture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/CBI.2018.10041 http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/CBI.2018.10041 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/wecwis/cbi2018-2.html#SottetGB18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cbi.2018.10041,,10.1109/cbi.2018.10041,2891326394,,0,009-849-689-611-987; 014-993-021-582-01X; 022-515-387-914-06X; 040-052-938-202-013; 041-809-749-965-95X; 042-161-509-269-688; 044-588-415-850-872; 084-780-846-974-237; 088-588-505-198-474; 089-496-049-768-581; 094-928-867-367-146; 101-412-834-406-65X; 118-916-539-353-256; 120-580-660-668-976; 123-533-676-149-932; 155-855-852-192-343; 162-725-429-164-626; 194-942-319-635-265,0,False,,,lens

Evidence from the recent financial crisis,,2014.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Renata Karkowska,"Systemic risk is a very important but very complex notion in banking and how to measure it; adequately is challenging. We introduce a new framework for measuring systemic risk by using a risk-adjusted balance sheet approach. The measure models credit risk of banks as a put option on bank assets, a tradition that originated with Merton. We conceive of an individual bank’s systemic risk as its contribution to the potential sector-wide net. In this regard, the analysis of public commercial banks operating in 7 countries from Central and Eastern Europe, shows potential risk which could threaten all the financial system. The paper shows how risk management tools can be applied in new ways to measure and analyze systemic risk in European banking system. The research results is a systemic risk map for the CEE banking systems. The study finds also instability of systemic risk determinants.",1,,100,120,Financial economics; Operational risk; Business; Systemic risk; Risk management tools; Credit risk; Balance sheet; Eastern european; Financial risk management; Financial system; Financial risk,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:58803 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/58803/,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:58803,,,1959882499,,0,,0,False,,,lens

We propose a risk measure to characterize systemic events of the dynamic network, based on quantile functions theory. We provide explicit calculations or estimates for our consensus dynamic both in transient and steady-state dynamics. Our analysis highlights the dependence of risk on the spectral properties of the communication graph and the delay of the network. Unlike consensus networks with no delay, the risk measure exhibits a non-monotonic behavior in presence of time-delay. This non-monotonicity is the origin of potential aggregate fluctuation which is an undesirable systemic event of our network.",,,2351,2356,Quantile; Random variable; Dynamic network analysis; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Risk measure; Noise measurement; Mathematics; Stochastic process; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/amcc/acc2017.html#SomarakisGM17 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7963304/ http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/amcc/acc2017.html#SomarakisGM17,http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/acc.2017.7963304,,10.23919/acc.2017.7963304,2735793238,,0,008-244-703-863-841; 012-633-747-894-627; 043-422-186-368-903; 043-846-904-058-299; 053-173-014-782-735; 063-064-192-377-089; 064-371-652-217-761; 068-926-087-240-142; 088-475-000-175-399; 089-237-966-916-645; 117-961-681-405-463; 139-443-258-321-658; 140-962-167-978-515; 196-341-480-069-844,14,False,,,lens

Study was carried out for 18 months from Dec 2011 to May 2013. History regarding age, gender, chronic tobacco intake, chronic alcohol intake, hypertension, diabetes, systemic corticosteroid intake, thyroid disease and family history of glaucoma was taken.Ocular examination like IOP measurement, Gonioscopy and Visual Field Charting was done. General evaluation included anthropometric measurements–height and weight (for BMI), blood pressure by sphygmomanometer, blood sugar estimation (Fasting & Post prandial) and thyroid function test. Odds ratio was calculated to estimate the risk.Higher BMI, chronic tobacco intake, known family history, Hypertension and Diabetes were proved as positive risk factors for POAG. Thyroid dysfunction, alcohol intake and chronic systemic steroid intake were not significantly associated with POAG.",,,,,Internal medicine; Surgery; Case-control study; Odds ratio; Glaucoma; Thyroid function tests; Thyroid disease; Family history; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine; Blood pressure,,,,,,,,,2187991025,,0,001-146-897-022-851; 001-904-012-103-524; 002-873-149-683-520; 003-856-222-605-097; 003-962-915-942-335; 004-871-364-053-920; 004-873-204-585-927; 005-126-324-622-873; 010-344-899-408-882; 010-563-666-494-732; 012-391-594-143-128; 012-457-936-046-520; 014-588-090-175-750; 014-742-796-084-503; 016-048-677-103-129; 016-284-625-342-640; 018-191-065-390-854; 018-207-360-004-323; 020-475-273-071-061; 024-082-052-164-035; 025-034-004-641-722; 028-999-285-834-247; 029-468-673-357-28X; 030-210-677-097-187; 033-122-061-381-912; 035-610-840-633-897; 042-943-411-884-46X; 045-137-009-766-257; 047-446-067-796-659; 047-811-705-875-208; 051-084-999-218-778; 051-288-570-096-661; 051-710-190-210-574; 055-561-566-024-85X; 058-139-580-487-67X; 058-641-037-274-57X; 063-878-534-420-28X; 069-049-946-227-806; 082-041-659-823-87X; 094-510-236-672-445; 099-013-077-856-144; 101-350-712-721-829; 101-545-567-696-97X; 109-594-744-750-896; 118-163-943-852-221; 162-607-746-812-220,1,False,,,lens

Preventive interventions are prominent to eliminate the risks and help to build a more resilient financial system. Although tremendous efforts have been made to measure multi-risk severity levels, understand the contagion behaviors and other risk management problems, there still lacks a theoretical framework revealing what and how regulatory intervention measurements can mitigate systemic risk. Here we demonstrate regshock, a practical visual analytical approach to support the exploration and evaluation of financial regulation measurements. We propose risk-island, an unprecedented risk-centered visualization algorithm to help uncover the risk patterns while preserving the topology of financial networks. We further propose regshock, a novel visual exploration and assessment approach based on the simulation-intervention-evaluation analysis loop, to provide a heuristic surgical intervention capability for systemic risk mitigation. We evaluate our approach through extensive case studies and expert reviews. To our knowledge, this is the first practical systemic method for the financial network intervention and risk mitigation problem; our validated approach potentially improves the risk management and control capabilities of financial experts.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Systemic risk; Heuristic; Control (management); Financial networks; Intervention (counseling); Risk management; Computer science; Financial regulation; Visual analytics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2104.11863.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2104.11863.html,,,3165379685,,0,,0,False,,,lens

132-685-721-637-089,"Clearing, settlement and legal infrastructure: ways forward",,2011.0,,,,,,M. Haentjens,"Crises tend to painfully lay bare where the law has been working and where not. Some have therefore predicted that the most recent financial crisis would spark a lot of attention to the clearing and settlement industry, the business which effectuates the post-trade process. This business concerns the settlement of securities transactions, i.e. the delivery of securities against payment of funds after a trade has been entered into, either on a stock exchange or “over the counter”.Virtually all major banks participate in the settlement business. The authors who predicted renewed interest in the clearing and settlement business have history to show for. In 1990, the Drexel Burnham Lambert insolvency exposed that the US clearing and settlement legal framework had not held pace with the developments in practice—with dramatic results. In the aftermath, art.8 of the Uniform Commercial Code was reformed to create a modernised legal infrastructure for securities custody and settlement of securities transactions. While the Drexel Burnham Lambert insolvency finally led to legislative reform, it happened in two steps. The dramatic increase in securities transactions during the post-World War II decades was not matched by the development of a system through which securities could be easily delivered and corresponding payments could be made. For each and every transaction, securities certificates still had to be manually transported between banks (and brokers) holding those securities for their clients. When, in 1968, this system clogged up and securities trades took months to settle, as a first step of reform, a multi-tiered securities custody system was implemented whereby all physical certificates are held with a central securities depository (CSD), major banks and brokers maintain securities accounts (on behalf of clients and themselves) with the CSD, and clients/investors maintain securities accounts with the banks. While the new multi-tiered system allowed securities to be credited and transferred by book-entries in securities accounts, in many jurisdictions, such book-entries did not represent a legal entitlement that takes free of competing claims by the bank’s own creditors. TheDrexel Burnham Lambert insolvency, where this deficiency in the law became painfully apparent, spurred a Uniform Commercial Code art.8 reform which corrected this. During the recent financial crisis, the modernised post-trade system as just discussed was severely stressed. Whereas the trade process simply dried up, the post-trade process was tested by several insolvencies, the Lehman Brothers insolvency being the most notable instance. Fortunately, as far as I have been able to ascertain, no serious problems were encountered by clearing and settlement systems, which appear to have absorbed substantial unsettled transactions, i.e. transactions for which either the delivery (of securities) or payment failed. A much feared chain reaction did not occur. Whereas this systemic risk did not materialise—the legal infrastructure of the post-trade process proved to be relatively solid—significant inefficiencies, albeit already known, became more acutely apparent, as the downward pressure on fees for settlement functions mounted in an environment in which all financial service providers had to cut costs.",26,5,243,247,Clearing; Financial services; Business; Creditor; Stock exchange; Uniform Commercial Code; Settlement (finance); Financial crisis; Insolvency; Financial system,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fd95fc084-431e-43c1-986a-55fd3f578f0a,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fd95fc084-431e-43c1-986a-55fd3f578f0a,,,2988022847,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Part II – Interaction Risks",2019-11-10,2019.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Ryan Clements,"Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) – tradeable investments that provide a return linked to an underlying index or basket of assets – are likely the most successful financial product since the 2008 crisis. Over the last decade they’ve experienced remarkable growth. Yet these products may also be making the financial system less stable and, like Wall Street innovations of the past, connecting banks and main street with dangerous implications. This final article – of a two-part study on ETF risks – posits that these products may be introducing two “interaction risks” into financial markets due to a complex operating and trading ecosystem. First, ETFs could create information cascades, facilitate investor herding, and financial contagion. Second, ETFs could be distorting the informational efficiency of underlying asset and securities prices, and disincentivizing active price discovery, in a way that masks market risk.; ; This article builds on its predecessor, which showed how ETFs could create a fragile “illusion” of liquidity, since financial intermediaries, in a crisis, often act unpredictably and pursue discretionary incentives. The combined study compliments prior work on financial market systemic risk by analogizing ETF interaction risks to prior crises – particularly 2008. Given the comparisons, the ETF market’s continuing growth and interest by retail investors, institutions, and pensions, regulatory and academic attention should be increased to ensure risks are both understood and appropriately mitigated.

114-697-358-887-408,Introduction to Credit Derivatives,2014-08-19,2014.0,book chapter,Practical Methods of Financial Engineering and Risk Management,,Apress,,Rupak Chatterjee,"The risk of a counterparty of a financial contract failing to live up to their obligations is real and can have far-reaching consequences. The financial system is predicated on the fact that when one buys an option or bond or enters into a swap with a counterparty, the expectation is that they will honor all contingent or promised cash flows from the financial instruments in question. The failure to meet a payment of any sort is considered a credit event and is called a default. Defaults may occur when companies declare bankruptcy and can no longer meet their debt obligations in terms of interest and principal payments. Government entities—such as countries, states, and municipalities—all can issue debt and therefore can default on this debt. Individuals default when they cannot make their mortgage or credit card payments. The risk of large counterparties such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns defaulting (during the 2008 subprime crisis) can have potentially devastating effects on the financial system as a whole. Large banks such as Citi and Bank of America defaulting can lead to a “run on cash” from their ordinary depositors and potential riots in the streets. The risk of the whole financial system collapsing due to a few events such as the 2008 subprime crisis is known as systemic risk. Therefore, the US government along with the Fed bailed out the big banks during the 2008 subprime crisis. Some have argued that this bailout has created an environment of moral hazard. If banks know that they will get bailed out, they will take large risks without facing the downside consequences of taking those risks. There is always a counterplay between systemic risk and moral hazard. For instance, individuals defaulting on their mortgages does not create systemic risk; therefore, they are rarely bailed out, leading to no moral hazard issues. Airlines, on the other hand, are crucial for a country such as the United States and therefore will be bailed out, potentially leading to a moral hazard outcome. Most governments will accept the moral hazard risk over the systemic risk. The last time a US president chose not to bail out the financial system was after the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (Black Tuesday). This led to the Great Depression, which affected the whole world and lasted almost ten years.",,,237,281,Debt; Business; Systemic risk; Credit event; Counterparty; Bailout; Moral hazard; Credit default swap; Default; Financial system,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-6134-6_6 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-6134-6_6/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4302-6134-6_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4302-6134-6_6,,10.1007/978-1-4302-6134-6_6,251905639,,0,,0,False,,,lens

109-922-604-868-710,Ocular and systemic findings and their correlation with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis: a retrospective study.,,2002.0,journal article,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,10405488; 15389235,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,United States,Vicki A. Lyons-Wait; Sheila F. Anderson; John C. Townsend; Paul N. De Land,"Background. Optometrists often encounter patients with ocular signs and/or symptoms suggestive of carotid artery disease, but criteria for eye care practitioners concerning when to order carotid studies are not well established. A retrospective study in an optometry clinic was performed to determine if certain ocular findings and associated systemic risk factors were associated with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (HSCAS). Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients examined in the optometry clinic at the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999 to identify all patients who had carotid studies ordered. Charts were then reviewed to determine the ocular finding that prompted the carotid study. Statistical analysis using an odds-ratio was performed to determine whether any ocular sign/symptom or systemic risk factor was associated with HSCAS. Results. Of 3822 patients, 48 (1.26%) had carotid studies ordered. Eight (17%) had HSCAS of >50% and symptomatic patients were 1.6 times more likely to have HSCAS than asymptomatic patients. Patients with HSCAS were 1.8 times more likely to have retinal vascular occlusions, 1.9 times more likely to have normotensive glaucoma, 2.4 times more likely to have peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and 2.6 times more likely to be smokers, although none of these factors were found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS. However, the number of systemic diseases tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (HSCAS median = 3.5 and the non-HSCAS median = 2, p = 0.049). Conclusion. Although no single ocular or systemic risk factor was found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS, the number of systemic disease risk factors tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (p = 0.049). An extensive literature review was also performed to help establish guidelines for when to order carotid studies on the basis of ocular signs and/or symptoms as well as the presence of additive associated systemic risk factors.",79,6,353,362,Internal medicine; Surgery; Retrospective cohort study; Eye disease; Carotid artery disease; Vascular disease; Asymptomatic; Systemic disease; Stenosis; Risk factor; Medicine,,Aged; Amaurosis Fugax/complications; Arteriosclerosis/complications; Carotid Stenosis/complications; Eye Diseases/complications; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Vascular Diseases/complications,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12086301/ http://journals.lww.com/00006324-200206000-00008 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12086301 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/12086301,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00006324-200206000-00008,12086301,10.1097/00006324-200206000-00008,1980859529,,0,000-777-870-517-410; 001-060-172-983-658; 001-319-841-177-523; 001-907-428-450-777; 002-892-529-766-049; 003-718-236-479-882; 006-061-146-309-615; 006-409-224-508-252; 006-510-445-058-60X; 006-633-156-293-283; 006-995-194-519-544; 007-145-374-964-640; 008-060-849-681-841; 008-822-309-807-878; 009-439-746-238-09X; 009-822-499-148-207; 018-272-388-488-690; 018-648-147-157-412; 019-196-112-476-503; 019-461-698-135-670; 019-931-468-443-217; 022-945-544-998-739; 025-151-805-629-427; 027-587-679-161-738; 027-677-706-057-020; 027-804-090-994-743; 028-474-147-224-940; 028-982-638-638-380; 029-744-674-493-919; 031-263-214-587-273; 033-294-961-900-862; 035-232-693-979-840; 036-569-886-556-801; 037-308-215-066-781; 040-725-395-757-832; 041-468-460-576-555; 041-682-015-205-462; 046-962-509-864-765; 048-316-329-736-228; 049-925-394-984-201; 056-466-423-817-423; 056-821-514-813-755; 057-820-009-751-612; 058-420-892-105-591; 058-717-976-796-948; 063-458-441-969-061; 065-669-358-588-287; 069-403-473-428-809; 076-902-996-849-864; 077-508-070-910-984; 077-637-528-100-758; 078-354-355-335-239; 078-938-271-107-326; 081-598-712-879-98X; 082-520-918-442-739; 083-036-438-801-554; 089-505-204-761-462; 093-324-107-394-05X; 097-953-297-253-49X; 099-314-253-000-935; 103-411-901-359-418; 104-177-777-210-715; 109-590-471-879-951; 121-139-980-033-75X; 124-527-704-577-500; 131-771-312-054-688; 144-842-492-430-544; 164-063-883-156-661; 179-567-548-238-030,20,False,,,lens

Banking authorities often prevent systemic risk through an implicit insurance of interbank claims, or by reducing interbank transactions and centralizing banks' liquidity management. This paper investigates whether the flexability afforded by decentralized bank interactions can be preserved while protecting the central banks from the necessity of conducting undesired rescue operations. It develops a model in which decentralized interbank leading is motivated by peer monitoring. In this context, the paper derives the optimal prudential rules, and, in particular, looks at the impact of interbank monitoring on the solvency and liquidity ratios of borrowing and lending banks. Last, it provides conditions which a Too Big To Fail policy is or is not justified and studies the possibility of propagation of a bank's liquidity shock throughout the financial system.

Reddy,"John Kingman’s review of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) doubted the effectiveness of the UK’s Stewardship Code in encouraging informed and engaged stewardship by institutional investors of the companies in which they invest (issuers). Accordingly, the FRC published the Stewardship Code in 2020 in a final opportunity to prove its effectiveness and relevance, and, in particular, enhance issuer-specific engagement by institutional investors. The up-date has enhanced the reach and substance of the code. However, the legal, regulatory, contractual and competitive environment in which institutional investors exist will constantly forestall soft-law attempts to foster greater issuer-specific engagement, a point perhaps tacitly acknowledged by the 2020 Stewardship Code with its wider scope. Instead, in relation to engagement, stewardship disclosure should focus on the types of engagement that institutional investors are motivated to exercise in practice, such as engagement in response to hedge fund activism, and engagement on systemic risks.",84,4,842,873,Issuer; Business; Systemic risk; Relevance (law); Hedge fund; Institutional investor; Stewardship Code; Stewardship; Scope (project management); Public relations,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1468-2230.12636 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-2230.12636,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2230.12636,,10.1111/1468-2230.12636,3157899184,,0,,4,True,cc-by,hybrid,lens

Sarcinelli,"Charles Kindleberger once described international financial crises as an “evergreen”. Indeed, looking back over the last 400 years it is hard not to get a sense of their regularity or invincible fate. However, the current structural market transformations taking place in the wake of globalisation call for an analysis of the fresh roots of that “evergreen” of systemic risk. The author offers some semantic and theoretical premises before looking into the role of the human factor in the prevention and control of a crisis from spreading from an isolated case to the system as a whole. Cases are described in which organisational consistency and the quality of corporate governance, shared purposes and a common culture, and sufficient transparency are important to containing systemic risk and curbing panics.

INTRODUCTIONThe Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD or the Directive) is a European Union (EU) law that addresses the high level of economic instability and systemic risk revealed by recent financial crises.1 The European Commission (the Commission) promulgated this law in 2010 to address the inadequate protection for investors and to manage and minimize the systemic risk created by hedge funds and other relatively risky investment vehicles.2 The Directive labels these funds as ""alternative investment funds"" (funds) and refers to their managers as ""alternative investment fund managers"" (fund managers).3The Directive's primary policy objectives are (1) risk management and (2) the creation of a unified, or ""harmonized,"" regulatory framework that allows fund managers to market and manage funds across EU countries (Member States) if they meet the Directive's requirements.4 The first policy goal of ""risk management"" includes addressing both systemic market risks and providing greater protection to EU investors.5 The second policy goal concerning the creation of a ""harmonized [p]an-European regulatory framework"" is intended to increase transparency in the alternative investment funds market by applying uniform rules to the conduct of fund managers active in the EU, and to protect EU fund managers that comply with the Directive from competitors in thirdcountries that have weaker regulations. …",17,1,9,,Manager of managers fund; Accounting; Systemic risk; Open-end fund; Economics; Hedge fund; European union; Fund of funds; Investment fund; Closed-end fund,,,,,https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol17/iss1/9/ https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1708&context=cjil,https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cjil/vol17/iss1/9/,,,2540071107,,0,,1,False,,,lens

We first measure industry's conditional-value-at-risk (CoVaR) and the systemic risk contribution (ΔCoVaR) using the fitted time-varying t-copula function. The network of the stock industry is established based on dynamic conditional correlations with the minimum spanning tree. Then, we investigate the connection characteristics and topology of the network. Finally, we utilize seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SUR) of panel data to analyze the relationship between network topology of the stock industry and the industry's systemic risk contribution. The results show that the systemic risk contribution of small-scale industries such as real estate, food and beverage, software services, and durable goods and clothing, is higher than that of large-scale industries, such as banking, insurance and energy. Industries with large betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficient and small node occupancy layer are associated with greater systemic risk contribution. In addition, further analysis using a threshold model confirms that the results are robust.",12,7,1,19,Betweenness centrality; Business; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Financial market; Network topology; Seemingly unrelated regressions; Stock market; Centrality; Stock (geology),,"China; Cluster Analysis; Financial Management; Humans; Industry/economics; Marketing/economics; Models, Economic; Risk",,National Social Science Fund of China,https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0180382.html https://paperity.org/p/80256655/does-network-topology-influence-systemic-risk-contribution-a-perspective-from-the https://doaj.org/article/88e21dc346d44d4ba2edb2144a7d6bff https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1280382L/abstract https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180382 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28683130 https://core.ac.uk/display/149476047 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5500295 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180382&type=printable https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180382,28683130,10.1371/journal.pone.0180382,2732849779,PMC5500295,0,000-216-260-904-018; 000-846-266-307-085; 001-428-877-938-251; 003-964-735-891-306; 004-644-450-850-109; 005-908-452-498-260; 007-536-742-089-13X; 007-674-701-950-355; 015-330-084-659-28X; 015-400-882-099-281; 017-486-496-247-162; 021-362-483-183-884; 021-678-898-172-395; 024-828-296-919-906; 029-652-108-487-444; 034-275-726-375-431; 038-127-620-589-387; 040-675-832-397-079; 043-743-158-285-729; 044-728-742-487-03X; 045-777-161-498-037; 045-930-731-578-775; 046-169-328-895-892; 049-430-988-738-302; 049-661-520-876-521; 050-982-814-438-298; 053-218-295-144-866; 057-735-966-724-994; 059-919-819-631-834; 062-326-683-107-447; 062-357-536-171-862; 063-003-248-410-011; 063-516-700-620-458; 064-721-452-904-53X; 068-325-150-541-455; 075-897-862-903-52X; 078-716-378-262-242; 081-474-615-941-986; 083-508-652-775-775; 090-328-172-692-220; 093-198-304-234-587; 094-299-996-884-482; 094-836-682-333-662; 100-589-237-612-532; 109-381-535-599-334; 115-776-463-401-74X; 123-699-515-895-205; 130-419-949-306-871; 132-090-269-322-992; 135-193-081-850-17X; 142-977-638-251-377; 145-859-024-843-652; 152-942-865-514-256; 161-388-814-416-825; 170-056-544-686-862; 174-412-248-820-805; 179-258-648-263-824; 183-051-601-605-352,17,True,cc-by,gold,lens

One popular method to assess and quantify the risk of contagion is employing the co-risk measures and risk contribution measures. It is interesting and important to understand how the underlining dependence structure and magnitude of random risks jointly affect systemic risk measures. In this paper, we mainly focus on the conditional value-at-risk, conditional expected shortfall, the delta conditional value-at-risk, and the delta conditional expected shortfall. Existing studies mainly focus on the situation with two random risks, and this paper makes some contributions by considering the scenario with possibly more than two random risks. By employing the tools of stochastic order, positive dependence concepts and arrangement monotonicity, several results concerning the usual stochastic order, increasing convex order, dispersive order and excess wealth order are presented. Concisely speaking, it is found that for a large enough stress level, a larger random risk tends to lead to a more severe systemic risk. We also performed some Monte Carlo experiments as illustrations for the theoretical findings.</jats:p>",10,19,3611,3611,Expected shortfall; Value at risk; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Order (exchange); Actuarial science; Monotonic function; Focus (optics); Risk management; Risk analysis (engineering); Economics; Mathematics; Financial crisis; Business; Physics; Finance; Mathematical analysis; Optics; Macroeconomics,,,,Guangdong Natural Science Foundation,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10193611,,10.3390/math10193611,,,0,003-236-583-464-974; 006-509-760-880-208; 007-600-429-600-521; 007-755-378-863-407; 010-343-664-389-328; 015-443-081-525-842; 025-599-126-786-346; 028-042-738-531-353; 028-142-889-817-904; 033-357-331-080-017; 036-175-092-344-055; 048-949-258-344-744; 049-865-643-512-714; 055-316-202-823-133; 055-635-057-265-574; 058-303-693-282-55X; 066-667-189-399-780; 067-760-874-802-972; 068-926-087-240-142; 074-039-266-050-420; 078-932-739-215-959; 083-510-149-601-949; 086-124-676-953-827; 106-812-062-934-78X; 115-806-665-215-624; 131-584-529-551-737; 133-704-577-497-76X; 141-840-648-446-756; 160-473-061-349-09X; 168-422-163-339-942,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Georgiou; Allen Tannenbaum,"Measuring systemic risk or fragility of financial systems is a ubiquitous task of fundamental importance in analyzing market efficiency, portfolio allocation, and containment of financial contagions. Recent attempts have shown that representing such systems as a weighted graph characterizing the complex web of interacting agents over some information flow (e.g., debt, stock returns, shareholder ownership) may provide certain keen insights. Here, we show that fragility, or the ability of system to be prone to failures in the face of random perturbations, is negatively correlated with geometric notion of Ricci curvature. The key ingredient relating fragility and curvature is entropy. As a proof of concept, we examine returns from a set of stocks comprising the S\&P 500 over a 15 year span to show that financial crashes are more robust compared to normal ""business as usual"" fragile market behavior - i.e., Ricci curvature is a ""crash hallmark."" Perhaps more importantly, this work lays the foundation of understanding of how to design systems and policy regulations in a manner that can combat financial instabilities exposed during the 2007-2008 crisis.",,,,,Financial economics; Information flow (information theory); Debt; Shareholder; Ricci curvature; Systemic risk; Economics; Curvature; Stock (geology); Fragility,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1505.05182.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1505.05182,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1505.05182.html,,,3123981573,,0,,13,False,,,lens

An effective methodology to quantify systemic risk is at the heart of the process of identifying the so-called systemically important ﬁnancial institutions for regulatory purposes as well as to investigate key drivers of systemic contagion. The paper proposes a method for dynamic forecasting of CoVaR, a popular measure of systemic risk. As a ﬁrst step, we develop a semi-parametric framework using asymptotic results in the spirit of extreme value theory (EVT) to model the conditional probability distribution of a bivariate random vector given that one of the components takes on a large value, taking into account important features of ﬁnancial data such as asymmetry and heavy tails. In the second step, we embed the proposed EVT method into a dynamic framework via a bivariate GARCH process.

157-895-520-168-573,As redes complexas e o estudo do risco sistêmico no sistema financeiro,,,dissertation,,,"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Agencia USP de Gestao da Informacao Academica (AGUIA)",,Leandro Augusto Ferreira,"As crises financeiras são processos de perdas decorrentes do mecanismo do mercado financeiro. Elas afetam as instituições do sistema financeiro e por meio do processo de contágio se espalham por ele, algumas vezes analogamente ao efeito dominó. Este processo pode levar muitas instituições financeiras saudáveis a se tornarem insolventes. Isso acontece porque os agentes econômicos estão interligados por meio de relações contratuais e se tornam dependentes uns aos outros. O risco sistêmico pode ser entendido como o risco de uma grande perda em um sistema. O presente trabalho tem como objetivo utilizar as propriedades de um modelo de contágio, proposto para estudar os efeitos da propagação de crises financeiras, bem como a mensuração do risco sistêmico no sistema interbancário. Este problema foi investigado considerando três diferentes topologias de rede: Erdös-Rényi, Livre de Escala (ou Scale-Free) e Interbancária Empírica. A escolha destas topologias foi pelo fato de que duas delas - Livre de Escala e Interbancária Empírica - podem emular o sistema bancário real e a de Erdös-Rényi ter sido utilizada em diversos modelos da literatura. Cada nó representa um banco que possui balanço patrimonial constituído de passivos (patrimônio líquido, empréstimos e depósitos) e ativos (empréstimos, títulos e valores mobiliários). Foi analisada a influência da alavancagem do sistema, da probabilidade inicial de default e do número de clusters da rede Interbancária Empírica. O risco sistêmico foi medido utilizando o Indicador de Risco Sistêmico, o Índice de Risco Sistêmico e o VaR Sistêmico. Mostrou-se que as redes Livres de Escala são mais robustas em relação aos ataques aleatórios evitando o aumento da inadimplência. O aumento abrupto do impacto causados pela crise acontece devido ao aumento do grau de alavancagem do sistema. O número de clusters da rede Interbancária Empírica impacta a robustez do sistema. O modelo reproduz o resultado conhecido como Muito Interconectado para Falhar, que é quando bancos mais interconectados oferecem maior risco ao sistema.The financial crises are processes of losses arising from financial market mechanism. They affect the institutions of the financial system by the process of contagion. Sometimes it is equal to the domino effect. This process can make many healthy financial institutions become insolvents. It happens because economic agents are interconnected through contractual relations and become dependent on each other. Systemic risk can be understood as the risk of a huge loss in a system. The present work aims to study the properties of a contagion model proposed to study the effects of the spread of financial crises, as well as the measurement of systemic risk in the interbank system. This problem was investigated considering three different network topologies: Erdös-Rényi, Scale-Free and Empirical Interbank. The choice of these topologies was made by the fact that two of them - Scale-Free and Empirical Interbank - may emulate the real banking system and Erdös-Rényi has been used in several models in the literature. Each node is a bank and consists on a balance sheet split as liabilities (equity, borrowings and deposits) and assets (lendings, bonds and securities). It was analyzed the influence of the coefficient of leverage, the influence of the initial probability of default and the influence of the number of clusters on the Empirical Interbank. The systemic risk was measured using the Systemic Risk Indicator, Systemic Index and Systemic Value at Risk. It was shown that Scale-Free networks are more robust against random attacks, avoiding increases in the number of defaults. The abrupt increase in the impact caused by the crisis happens due to the increase in coefficient of leverage. The number of clusters on Empirical Interbank network impacts the robustness of the system. The model reproduces the result known as Too Interconnected to Fail, that is, banks more interconnected offer higher risk to the system",,,,,,,,,,https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/100/100132/tde-12092013-184127/publico/LEANDRO_A_FERREIRA.pdf https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/100/100132/tde-12092013-184127/,http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/d.100.2013.tde-12092013-184127,,10.11606/d.100.2013.tde-12092013-184127,1653117062,,0,,0,True,cc-by-nc-sa,gold,lens

Hutchison,"Center for Analytical Finance University of California, Santa Cruz Working Paper No. 2 The Transmission of Federal Reserve Tapering News to Emerging Financial Markets Joshua Aizenman, Mahir Binici and Michael M. Hutchison June 4, 2014 Abstract This paper evaluates the impact of tapering “news” announcements by Fed senior policy makers on financial markets in emerging economies. We apply a panel framework using daily data, and find that emerging market asset prices respond most to statements by Fed Chairman Bernanke, and much less to other Fed officials. We group emerging markets into those with “robust” fundamentals (current account surpluses, high international reserves and low external debt) and those with “fragile” fundamentals and, intriguingly, find that the stronger group was more adversely exposed to tapering news than the weaker group. News of tapering coming from Chairman Bernanke is associated with much larger exchange rate depreciation, drops in the stock market, and increases in sovereign CDS spreads of the robust group compared with the fragile group. A possible interpretation is that tapering news had less impact on countries that received fewer inflows of funds in the first instance during the quantitative years and had less to lose in terms of repatriation of capital and reversal of carry-trade activities.

The Eurostat database contains data on House price indices (HPI) at national level for all EU member states. The data starts in 2005 for some countries, and later for the others. From 2010 onwards, the available data allows a comparison encompassing all EU Member states plus Norway and Island.The advantage of the Eurostat data is that it is official data, compiled based on transaction prices and following a harmonised methodology across countries. The objective of this presentation is to show how this database can provide reliable answers to the following questions:How deep was the dip in the EU countries? When did the various countries pass with HPI pre-crisis levels? Who were the best performers in the last decade?The Eurostat database also contains data on the evolution of prices for new and existing dwellings. This presentation will reveal how the Eurostat database can be used to shed light on the analysis of the different patterns of the HPI for new and existing dwellings during the crisis and the following recovery. We show that by taking into account the dynamics of construction activity and sales of new dwellings during and after the crisis, the Eurostat data can be effectively used in the analysis of the evolution of housing markets in the EU in the last decade. A special focus will be on the countries having received a warning from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) at end 2016 having identified these residential real estate markets as a risk for financial stability.Furthermore, we show how this data can be combined with data on rent prices evolution available also in the Eurostat database from the section dedicated to the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices. One relevant question is: did rent developments between 2008 and 2018 show similar patterns to house prices or were the rents developments much softer? Knowing what the data represents helps for a correct interpretation of the official figures.In summary, these datasets being official statistics published by Eurostat support to analyse both longer-term developments like recoveries after the crisis or latest developments indicating towards overheated residential real estate markets.",,,,,Financial economics; Economic rent; Business; Systemic risk; Official statistics; Financial crisis; Index (economics); Residential real estate; House price; Database transaction,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arz/wpaper/eres2019_276.html https://eres.architexturez.net/doc/oai-eres-id-eres2019-276,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arz/wpaper/eres2019_276.html,,,2972783616,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Although largely underdeveloped in the literature, the macroprudential regulation of mortgage lending would have two goals: an ex ante goal of preventing systemic shocks in housing finance and the housing sector, and an ex post goal of ensuring that housing finance, the housing sector, and the financial system more broadly are robust enough to resist contagion and mitigate adverse consequences if and when systemic shocks occur.

There remains empirical ambiguity, how-ever, as to whether these cycles coincide. Recent papers suggest bytheir empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaultsand credit spreads tend to co-move with macro-economic variables. Iftrue, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regu-lation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1933–1997U.S. data on real GDP, credit spreads, and business failure rates toshed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate un-observed components framework to disentangle credit and businesscycles. We distinguish two types of cycles in the data, correspond-ing to periods of around 6 and 11-16 years, respectively. Cyclicalco-movements between GDP and business failures mainly arise at thelonger frequency. At the higher frequency of 6 years, co-cyclicalityis less clear-cut. We also show that spreads reveal a positive andnegative co-cyclicality with failure rates and GDP, respectively. Thispattern disappears, however, if we concentrate on the post World WarII period.

Vegh; Guillermo Vuletin,"In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it is hard to find any macroeconomic policy report that does not include some reference to financial stability or systemic risk and the resulting need for “macroprudential policies.” While there is a large and growing literature on macroprudential policies and financial stability, less attention has been paid to how macroprudential policies may facilitate macroeconomic stabilization in the presence of large capital flows. To fill such a gap, this report looks at the use of reserve requirements (RR) as a macroprudential tool. Its findings should be of particular interest to emerging market economists and policymakers that are faced with difficult questions regarding how to cope effectively with volatile capital flows. The analysis builds upon a new dataset on quarterly RR covering a large number of industrial and developing countries for the period 1970-2011. It finds that while no industrial country has resorted to active RR policy since 2004, almost half of developing countries have. Indeed, together with interest rates adjustments and forex interventions, RR seem to be an important component of a trio of policy instruments that developing countries have relied upon to navigate through the boom-bust cycles driven by capital flows. The ultimate reason for resorting to RR lies essentially on the procyclical behavior of the exchange rate over the business cycle in developing countries (with the currency depreciating in bad times and appreciating in good times) that complicates enormously the use of interest rates as a countercyclical instrument. Under such circumstances, RR are an effective instrument that can be used countercyclically when concerns about the effects of interest rates on the exchange rate become paramount. Finally, the report suggests that while, from a macroprudential point of view, the most common macroprudential instruments are equivalent, from a microprudential one they are not. Conflicts may thus arise between the micro- and macro-prudential policy stances. In addition, the overall design of macroprudential policies should follow a careful analysis of the role that different financial frictions play in various environments since similar symptoms can reflect very different underlying forces.",,,,,Emerging markets; Currency; Systemic risk; Reserve requirement; Economics; Interest rate; Exchange rate; Financial crisis; Foreign exchange market; Monetary economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/b/wbk/wbpubs/17584.html,https://ideas.repec.org/b/wbk/wbpubs/17584.html,,,3142482663,,0,,2,False,,,lens

Measuring the level of systemic importance of financial institutions, we find that size is a leading determinant confirming the usual ""Too Big To Fail"" argument. Nevertheless, the relation is non-linear during the recent global financial crisis. Moreover, since 2003, other determinants of systemic importance emerge. For example, decisions made by financial institutions on their choice of asset holdings, methods of funding, and sources of income have had a significant effect on the level of systemic importance during the global financial crises starting in 2008. These findings help to identify systemically important financial institutions by examining their relevant banking activities and to further design macro-prudential regulation towards reducing the systemic risk in the financial system.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Asset (economics); Financial crisis; Financial institution; Too big to fail; Argument,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/dnb/dnbwpp/347.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dnb:dnbwpp:347,https://ideas.repec.org/p/dnb/dnbwpp/347.html,,,3122594783,,0,,2,False,,,lens
013-258-861-586-112,"Three Essays of Applied Bayesian Modeling: Financial Return Contagion, Benchmarking Small Area Estimates, and Time-Varying Dependence",2013-09-27,2013.0,dissertation,,,,,Andrew Jay Vesper,"This dissertation is composed of three chapters, each an application of Bayesian statistical models to particular research questions. In Chapter 1, we evaluate systemic risk exposure of financial institutions. Building upon traditional regime switching approaches, we propose a network model for volatility contagion to assess linkages between institutions in the financial system. Focusing empirical analysis on the financial sector, we find that network connectivity has dynamic properties, with linkages between institutions increasing immediately before the recent crisis. Out-of-sample forecasts demonstrate the ability of the model to predict losses during distress periods. We find that institutional exposure to crisis events depends upon the structure of linkages, not strictly the number of linkages. In Chapter 2, we develop procedures for benchmarking small area estimates. In sample surveys, precision can be increased by introducing small area models which “borrow strength” by incorporating auxiliary covariate information. One consequence of using small area models is that small area estimates at lower geographical levels typically will not aggregate to the estimate at the corresponding higher geographical levels. Benchmarking is the statistical procedure for reconciling these differences. Two new approaches to Bayesian benchmarking are introduced, one procedure based on Minimum Discrimination Information, and another for Bayesian self-consistent conditional benchmarking. Notably the proposed procedures construct adjusted posterior distributions whose moments all satisfy benchmarking constraints. In the context of the Fay-Herriot model, simulations are conducted to assess benchmarking performance. In Chapter 3, we exploit the Pair Copula Construction (PCC) to develop a flexible multivariate model for time-varying dependence. The PCC is an extremely flexible model for capturing complex, but static, multivariate dependency. We use a Bayesian framework to",,,,,Finance; Bayesian probability; Copula (probability theory); Statistical model; Small area estimation; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Bayesian inference; Multivariate statistics; Economics; Operations research; Benchmarking,,,,,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11124829 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11124829/Vesper_gsas.harvard_0084L_10912.pdf?sequence=1,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11124829,,,1868202686,,0,000-846-266-307-085; 001-258-517-102-574; 001-274-723-652-948; 004-193-902-378-854; 004-277-557-249-469; 005-566-466-793-36X; 006-381-442-206-445; 006-659-120-939-252; 009-379-393-726-466; 010-737-434-773-81X; 011-438-050-903-386; 013-206-942-213-532; 014-861-903-267-148; 015-063-175-189-638; 015-187-177-332-607; 016-783-423-234-63X; 017-421-298-700-053; 018-182-957-727-198; 018-732-915-638-836; 019-479-903-647-583; 020-370-965-175-522; 026-046-227-276-595; 030-037-642-715-532; 033-166-641-839-023; 034-330-953-548-063; 034-565-642-362-436; 035-104-934-704-682; 037-596-603-345-722; 037-799-159-032-278; 038-080-443-203-467; 040-395-625-023-262; 040-983-564-788-886; 042-301-632-077-050; 042-912-478-495-82X; 043-579-708-518-573; 045-320-906-901-370; 046-064-655-058-556; 047-289-836-852-429; 047-590-216-708-912; 048-024-648-104-741; 050-194-176-735-249; 050-482-711-453-953; 052-619-799-818-546; 054-574-447-562-897; 058-069-182-360-699; 064-546-321-128-176; 064-586-496-729-797; 065-598-470-480-756; 066-305-971-315-18X; 066-327-676-270-318; 068-485-258-963-185; 072-752-524-486-456; 075-450-304-452-938; 075-897-862-903-52X; 078-883-884-677-553; 080-744-772-392-256; 081-264-294-612-376; 082-380-668-522-741; 086-260-434-815-196; 086-317-786-026-830; 088-670-290-046-803; 091-169-291-532-570; 091-384-088-522-133; 092-944-979-479-617; 093-512-050-205-147; 095-462-726-134-52X; 095-914-726-579-785; 100-446-896-445-856; 111-322-903-622-764; 113-659-246-746-658; 115-063-506-774-328; 118-143-167-239-054; 121-949-804-441-492; 124-811-334-022-150; 126-105-982-698-671; 132-516-014-763-759; 133-185-301-384-80X; 136-518-384-311-084; 138-331-652-128-642; 139-943-369-630-446; 142-357-234-903-255; 148-728-122-646-651; 150-364-231-280-588; 152-653-207-981-53X; 157-535-116-206-495; 158-257-523-418-339; 165-769-874-015-489; 175-215-055-280-105; 180-547-775-308-577; 198-944-659-141-32X,2,False,,,lens

Therefore, the research on layered financial networks is a key part of the systemic risk management. Various methods have been proposed in prior studies to find optimal partitioning of interbank networks into core and periphery subsets. However, these methods that have been adopted with approximation methods, in general, do not guarantee optimal bipartition. In this paper, a genetic simulated annealing algorithm is presented to detect a hierarchical structure in interbank networks as a hybrid heuristic algorithm, while its effects are also analyzed. The optimization of the error score for the core-periphery model is mathematically developed firstly as an improved expression of the optimization function, which incorporates the genetic algorithm into a simulated annealing algorithm to guarantee the optimal bipartition and to jump from a local optimization. The results of this algorithm are finally verified by empirical analysis of interbank networks; and, through the immunity strategy under the risk diffusion model, the significance of core-periphery structure to risk management is verified.",2020,,1,11,Mathematical optimization; Simulated annealing; Local search (optimization); Systemic risk; Heuristic (computer science); Financial market; Key (cryptography); Financial networks; Risk management; Complex network; Computer science; Function (mathematics); Genetic algorithm,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2020/2598580.pdf http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2020/2598580.pdf https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2020/2598580/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/2598580,,10.1155/2020/2598580,3094015210,,0,007-334-385-836-145; 008-069-346-004-815; 010-979-271-512-130; 012-159-433-435-625; 013-001-462-839-772; 013-366-143-910-959; 014-908-388-728-901; 018-831-663-650-903; 022-536-077-600-252; 025-915-350-487-916; 028-487-954-133-896; 028-533-634-750-363; 036-379-763-419-703; 036-615-479-671-743; 058-879-947-933-394; 063-747-800-214-332; 072-528-320-272-409; 091-991-583-786-253; 098-579-028-541-812; 106-840-243-371-267; 109-381-535-599-334; 109-809-818-125-846; 143-260-890-108-79X; 143-470-559-207-590; 151-157-458-453-53X,1,True,cc-by,gold,lens

In that sense, the chapter argues, reforming the institutional structure of the financial industry operates as a deeper form of the currently evolving macroprudential regulation. ; The chapter identifies three principal models that form a continuum of potential financial sector structural reform choices and applies this conceptual framework to analysis of post-crisis structural reforms in the U.K., EU, and U.S. It further examines how deeply issues of financial industry structure are embedded in central banks’ regulatory and policy agenda and, in light of this connection, discusses potential implications of current structural reforms for central banks’ post-crisis financial stability mandate.",,,,,Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Mandate; Volcker Rule; Lender of last resort; Macroprudential regulation; Financial regulation; Financial system; Interconnectedness,,,,,https://china.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781784719210/9781784719210.00029.xml https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3099621 https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781784719210/9781784719210.00029.xml https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3099621,http://dx.doi.org/10.4337/9781784719227.00029,,10.4337/9781784719227.00029,2782648383,,0,,2,True,,green,lens

This is reflected by the inclusion of IT risk guidelines in recent regulatory mandates, industry standards and enterprise risk management methodologies. IT risk is a key component of operational risk, mainly through two event types (or subcategories). One is business disruptions and system failures, which addresses the disruption of regular business due to system failures; the other is external fraud, which covers the threats from external parties trying to hack a firm's systems and computers. Across the US financial markets domain, operational IT events have been shown to have a larger impact on participants than IT security events or IT project failures (Goldstein 2009). Within this context, the monitoring of operational IT risk across the various organizations comprising an extended enterprise such as the US capital markets becomes an important element of systemic risk management for the economy. This paper suggests an approach to assessing IT risk within the operational risk context using an incident-based method for monitoring operational IT risk across an extended enterprise based on the Information Systems Audit and Control Association risk IT framework. The proposed monitoring methodology is illustrated with an example from an extended enterprise within the US capital market. Observations on the approach are also discussed and potential future research is outlined.",10,2,61,97,Risk analysis (engineering); Operational risk; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; IT risk; Enterprise risk management; Extended enterprise; Risk IT; IT risk management,,,,,https://www.risk.net/journal-of-operational-risk/technical-paper/2413196/monitoring-it-operational-risks-across-us-capital-markets,http://dx.doi.org/10.21314/jop.2015.156,,10.21314/jop.2015.156,3123584172,,0,,2,False,,,lens

In liquid modernity, risks and threats are becoming ever more global but remain systemic, while at the same time the solutions to these issues is relegated to the individual. The existence of a noticeable gap between society's insistence on individuality, autonomy, and self-assertion and the systemic risks to this claim, caused by a globalized flow of information, technology and politics, is thus the argument of the analysis of the video game <italic>BioShock</italic>. Science fiction as a genre here allows for the extrapolation and exaggeration of this gap by employing the posthuman as an extreme possibility of human identity creation. The dystopian imagination provides a bleak emphasis of the science-fictional dimension of consequence in terms of this development, by providing an alternative history in which rampant individualism meets an extreme form of consumer society. The human body has become the battleground of liquid modern desires to form and consume identities. Further, the medium uniquely provides the specific ideological commentary on the systemic nature of the illusion of autonomy, especially in liquid modern consumer society.</p>",,,,,Posthuman; Dystopia; Identity (music); Aesthetics; Individualism; Modernity; Sociology; Ideology; Personal identity; Argument (complex analysis); Autonomy; Epistemology; Environmental ethics; Politics; Self; Political science; Philosophy; Law; Biochemistry; Chemistry,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5949/liverpool/9781781383766.003.0005,,10.5949/liverpool/9781781383766.003.0005,,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Yermoliev; Aline Mosnier; Michael Obersteiner; David Leclère; Nikolay Khabarov; Hugo Valin; Wolf Heinrich Reuter,"Interdependencies among land-use systems resemble a complex network connected through demand–supply relations, and disruption of the network may catalyze systemic risks affecting food, energy, water, and environmental security (FEWES) worldwide. This paper describes the conceptual development, expansion, and practical application of a stochastic version of the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), a model that is used to assess competition for land use between agriculture, bioenergy, and forestry at regional and global scales. In the stochastic version of the model, systemic risks of various kinds are explicitly covered and can be analyzed and mitigated in all their interactions. While traditional deterministic scenario analysis produces sets of often contradictory outcomes, stochastic GLOBIOM explicitly derives robust decisions that leave the systems better off, independently of what scenario occurs. Stochastic GLOBIOM is formulated as a stochastic optimization model that is central for evaluating portfolios of robust interdependent decisions: ex ante strategic decisions (production allocation, storage capacities) and ex post adaptive (demand, trading, storage control) decisions. For example, the model is applied to the case of increased storage facilities, which can be viewed as catastrophe pools to buffer production shortfalls and fulfill regional and global FEWES requirements when extreme events occur. Expected shortfalls and storage capacities have a close relation with Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk risk measures. The Value of Stochastic Solutions is calculated to present the benefits of the stochastic over the deterministic model.",,,,,Environmental resource management; Environmental economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Scenario analysis; Stochastic optimization; Integrated management; Production (economics); Environmental security; Complex network; Land use,,,,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11805/,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11805/,,,2346144748,,0,,0,False,,,lens

This extremely young field of research has gained a lot of attention in recent times from academics and practioners alike because of global financial crises. The main contributions of the thesis can be grouped in four broad items.; ; Firstly, we propose a novel categorization of the risk measures advanced in recent years based on the modeling assumptions they rely upon. We identified four categories: measures based on portfolio theory, econometric indicators, network analysis and measures based on multivariate default distribution.; ; The second set of contributions regards the CIMDO framework, a methodology heavily used in systemic risk studies. We proved a new theoretical independence result that significantly extended previous ones. We also performed a comprehensive stability study where every input of the methodology was considered and whose conclusions should serve as guidance for future CIMDO users.; ; The third contribution is a new contagion model that is both tractable and flexible enough to be used with heterogeneous portfolios. We provided several theoretical results with respect to both marginal and joint default distribution. We also detailed a recursive algorithm to calculate the portfolio loss distribution in an efficient way. An application to the problem of pricing and hedging CDO products is hence shown.; ; Lastly, we introduced a new systemic risk measure in the context of contagion models called contagion loss ratio (CLR). It is based on attributing losses to either idiosyncratic or infection-driven events and represents the percentage of the total portfolio losses due to contagion. We showed how to calculate it in a variety of models and presented an application to the problem of banking stability.",,,,,Stability (learning theory); Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Set (psychology); Context (language use); Portfolio; Network analysis; Categorization; Modern portfolio theory,,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/30380 https://aisberg.unibg.it/retrieve/handle/10446/30380/15403/DT_Farina_Gianluca_2014.pdf,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/30380,,,1862230709,,0,000-846-266-307-085; 001-274-723-652-948; 001-355-306-290-901; 003-134-237-408-42X; 004-026-088-473-41X; 008-325-215-807-909; 008-620-705-366-714; 010-221-323-940-921; 010-671-720-220-221; 011-950-981-381-566; 013-118-111-585-482; 014-744-329-084-394; 015-935-034-794-258; 017-139-391-345-966; 020-879-608-801-080; 024-739-643-772-159; 026-146-369-419-270; 026-229-185-045-060; 027-781-893-882-64X; 030-306-352-344-019; 030-535-139-992-622; 030-617-409-787-549; 032-876-731-605-60X; 032-929-949-530-192; 033-535-199-193-83X; 033-551-123-947-420; 035-104-934-704-682; 036-490-978-821-850; 038-800-322-432-83X; 040-260-553-727-915; 045-705-979-262-060; 046-702-361-910-006; 047-298-610-921-502; 047-805-056-063-822; 048-427-165-992-808; 052-619-799-818-546; 055-524-357-166-744; 057-964-872-859-424; 058-982-261-191-328; 060-895-484-039-047; 063-307-180-194-027; 069-078-077-310-036; 071-822-808-161-420; 074-125-538-582-211; 074-849-208-298-983; 078-883-884-677-553; 080-141-291-906-663; 080-968-470-990-480; 083-508-652-775-775; 084-115-900-488-003; 086-771-766-095-679; 087-901-138-332-791; 089-085-561-504-861; 089-214-745-241-718; 089-312-271-767-951; 094-253-573-546-998; 096-306-267-703-00X; 097-892-937-633-962; 099-708-736-473-923; 108-116-090-859-223; 108-421-588-307-355; 109-786-562-581-071; 114-191-338-596-509; 117-134-370-076-974; 118-740-565-396-384; 119-408-273-837-119; 119-988-526-498-439; 122-235-985-162-901; 122-628-414-230-98X; 124-234-879-244-688; 124-548-275-720-331; 127-634-048-709-597; 132-581-676-290-277; 135-885-372-739-84X; 139-943-369-630-446; 143-715-772-899-533; 144-342-311-805-60X; 154-043-252-784-96X; 158-863-400-415-402; 170-056-544-686-862; 177-515-669-057-407; 181-056-832-336-76X; 183-376-861-980-736; 192-258-159-325-001; 194-454-521-747-655,0,False,,,lens

At the same time, banks' sovereign debt portfolios have featured an increasing home bias. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between these two facts, and its rationale. First, we inquire to what extent the dynamics of sovereign yield differentials relative to the swap rate and CDS premia reflect changes in perceived sovereign solvency risk or rather different responses to systemic risk due to the possible collapse of the euro. We do so by decomposing yield differentials and CDS spreads in a country-specific and a common risk component via a dynamic factor model. We then investigate how the home bias of banks' sovereign portfolios responds to yield differentials and to their two components, by estimating a vector error-correction model on 2007–13 monthly data. We find that in most countries of the eurozone, and especially in its periphery, banks' sovereign exposures respond positively to increases in yields. When bank exposures are related to the country and common risk components of yields, it turns out that (1) in the periphery, banks increase their domestic exposure in response to increases in country risk, while in core countries they do not; (2) in most eurozone countries banks respond to an increase in the common risk factor by raising their domestic exposures. Finding (1) suggests distorted incentives in periphery banks' response to changes in their own sovereign's risk. Finding (2) indicates that, when systemic risk increases, all banks tend to increase the home bias of their portfolios, making the eurozone sovereign market more segmented.; ; — Niccolo Battistini, Marco Pagano and Saverio Simonelli",29,78,203,251,Financial economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Country risk; Solvency; Core countries; Credit default swap; Risk factor (computing); Monetary economics; Yield (finance); Interest rate swap,,,,,http://oxfordjournals.org/page/6603/9 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2443992 https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/ecpoli/v29y2014i78p203-251..html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/ECOP_ECOP12029.pdf?abstractid=2443992&mirid=1 https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/article-abstract/29/78/203/2918380 http://economicpolicy.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/78/203.article-info https://econpapers.repec.org/article/blaecpoli/v_3a29_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a78_3ap_3a203-251.htm https://core.ac.uk/display/55116051,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0327.12029,,10.1111/1468-0327.12029,2145048954,,0,000-445-043-112-03X; 004-162-182-795-040; 005-634-693-343-491; 009-314-540-858-112; 010-454-886-737-49X; 010-494-243-875-158; 012-026-037-176-888; 012-255-090-748-733; 018-621-809-952-467; 019-806-902-073-579; 021-146-056-724-969; 022-215-836-643-150; 022-525-623-204-182; 022-878-939-122-478; 024-972-791-161-705; 029-209-549-941-204; 030-840-067-833-964; 031-628-697-456-460; 037-934-141-230-910; 038-472-900-446-513; 039-627-043-308-887; 040-569-546-141-292; 040-916-204-412-607; 041-219-084-104-37X; 041-833-561-895-427; 042-013-205-058-190; 046-381-192-796-753; 048-792-640-129-401; 056-652-650-590-600; 057-282-331-734-41X; 064-983-128-387-606; 067-383-732-969-442; 071-921-912-487-66X; 073-554-452-232-754; 076-792-796-362-117; 077-521-839-817-727; 086-024-113-057-449; 087-094-781-404-194; 087-150-483-296-416; 093-460-966-236-638; 093-591-325-771-665; 095-962-317-151-32X; 100-033-653-811-713; 113-800-595-934-411; 115-912-228-451-249; 121-307-599-498-531; 123-788-240-524-863; 153-050-394-015-030; 161-086-423-505-368; 171-302-492-406-837; 181-825-786-470-629; 194-074-851-158-701; 199-275-883-133-376,128,True,,green,lens

Systemic risk measures exhibit substantial variation across firms and over time. Debt and trade credit are related to both dimensions of systemic risk, while a range of other firm characteristics are associated with systemic risk in at least one direction. The differences between the dimensions of risk and their associated characteristics underline the importance of analysing both measures of risk.

036-252-084-075-904,Foreign Currency Loans and Systemic Risk in Europe,2013-06-01,2013.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Pinar Yesin,"Foreign currency loans to the unhedged non-banking sector are remarkably prevalent in Europe and create a significant exchange-rate-induced credit risk to European banking sectors. In particular, Swiss franc (CHF)-denominated loans, popular in Eastern European countries, could trigger simultaneous bank failures if depreciation of the domestic currencies prevents borrowers from servicing the loans. Foreign currency loans thus pose a systemic risk from a “common market shock” perspective. The author uses a novel dataset of foreign-currency loans from 17 countries for 2007-11 (collected by the Swiss National Bank) and builds on the method suggested by Ranciere, Tornell, and Vamvakidis (2010) to quantify this systemic risk. The author finds that systemic risk is substantial in the non-euro area, while it is relatively low in the euro area. However, CHF-denominated loans are not the underlying source of the high systemic risk: Loans denominated in other foreign currencies (probably to a large extent in euros) contribute significantly more to the systemic risk in the non-euro area than CHF-denominated loans. Furthermore, systemic risk shows high persistence and low volatility during the sample period. The author also finds that banks in Europe have continuously held more foreign-currency-denominated assets than liabilities, indicating their awareness of the exchange-rate-induced credit risk they face.",,,,,Currency; Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Euros; National bank; Eastern european; Shock (economics); Financial system; Depreciation,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:szg:worpap:1306 https://ideas.repec.org/p/szg/worpap/1306.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:szg:worpap:1306,,,3122104220,,0,,18,False,,,lens

The Financial Stability Forum (2009, p 8) defined financial procyclicality as “the dynamic interactions (positive feedback mechanisms) between the financial and the real sectors of the economy”. Financial procyclicality, according to this definition, does not refer only to the fluctuations of financial variables around a trend. Rather, as noted by Landau (2009), it encompasses all of the following three components: fluctuations around the trend, changes in the trend itself, and possible cumulative deviations from the equilibrium value.

If adopted, the Proposed ILC Rule would open the door to widespread acquisitions of ILCs by commercial firms engaged in industrial, retail, information technology, and other types of nonfinancial activities. In addition, on March 18, 2020, the FDIC approved deposit insurance applications filed by ILCs owned by two commercial firms – Square and Nelnet. ; ; The FDIC’s issuance of the Proposed ILC Rule and the FDIC’s approvals of Square’s and Nelnet’s applications represent a fundamental change in policy. Those actions effectively reverse the FDIC’s previous policy of barring acquisitions of ILCs by commercial firms. The FDIC imposed an 18-month moratorium on acquisitions of ILCs by commercial firms between July 2006 and January 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act placed a three-year moratorium on such acquisitions between July 2010 and July 2013. The FDIC did not allow any firms engaged in commercial activities to acquire ILCs from July 2006 (when the FDIC imposed its moratorium) until March 2020 (when the agency approved Square’s and Nelnet’s applications). The Proposed ILC Rule does not explain why the FDIC decided to initiate such a major change in policy with potentially transformative effects on our financial system, economy, and society. ; ; If adopted, the Proposed ILC Rule would be contrary to the public interest and unlawful for the following reasons:; ; (1) Further acquisitions of ILCs by commercial firms would (a) undermine Congress’s longstanding policy of separating banking and commerce, (b) threaten to inflict large losses on the federal “safety net” for financial institutions during future systemic crises, and (c) pose grave dangers to the stability of our financial system and the health of our economy.; ; (2) Further acquisitions of ILCs by commercial firms – including “Big Tech” firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft – would create toxic conflicts of interest and would also pose serious threats to competition and consumer welfare. ; ; (3) The FDIC’s limited supervisory powers over parent companies and other affiliates of ILCs are plainly inadequate to prevent the systemic risks, conflicts of interest, and threats to competition and consumer welfare generated by commercially-owned ILCs.; ; (4) Adoption of the Proposed ILC Rule would be contrary to the public interest factors specified in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and would also violate the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).; ; This article explains why adopting the Proposed ILC Rule would be contrary to the public interest and unlawful. In addition, the FDIC should not adopt the Proposed ILC Rule while our nation is preoccupied with the challenges of responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The FDIC should withdraw the Proposed ILC Rule, or postpone any further action on the Rule, until (1) the enormous problems caused by the pandemic have been successfully resolved, and (2) as required by the APA, the FDIC has completed the following actions: (a) explaining the factual, legal, and policy basis for its change in policy on acquisitions of ILCs by commercial firms, and (b) providing public notice of that explanation and affording the public a reasonable opportunity to submit comments on the FDIC’s change in policy and the agency’s stated reasons for making that change.

The complexity of financial institutions and the regulatory efforts make the analysis of the operational risk necessary. The main message of this book is that institution size has an important effect on operational risk exposure and management. Firstly, a well-behaving stylised stochastic process based approach underpins the applicability of Poisson frequency and fat-tailed loss distributions, however a method built from historical data on a small sample may result in estimation bias. Secondly similarly to the results for other countries the total operational risk losses in a given period are significantly correlated with gross income-based size of banks in Hungary as well, mainly driven by frequency. Finally, it is found that larger institutions are more inclined to use advanced operational risk management methods. This might be a favourable tendency from systemic risk point of view, as institutions with potentially higher system risk tend to apply more conscious risk management.",,,,,Operational risk; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Gross income; Operational risk management; Risk of loss; Basel II; Risk management; Estimation,,,,,https://www.knigozal.com/store/gb/book/operational-risk-of-banks-and-firm-size/isbn/978-3-659-36840-0,https://www.knigozal.com/store/gb/book/operational-risk-of-banks-and-firm-size/isbn/978-3-659-36840-0,,,3003711159,,0,120-957-737-992-596,0,False,,,lens
066-571-695-748-924,Narrowing the Bankruptcy Safe Harbor for Derivatives to Combat Systemic Risk,2010-06-05,2010.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Bryan G. Faubus,"Bankruptcy law establishes proceedings designed to rehabilitate debtors while protecting creditors, but a series of safe harbors effectively exempts from bankruptcy proceedings certain financial contracts known as derivatives. Accordingly, when a party to a derivative contract goes bankrupt, the counterparty may terminate the contract and seize what it is owed from the debtor’s assets. Congress enacted these safe harbors to combat the risk of systemic failure by maintaining liquidity in troubled markets; in doing so, however, they allowed counterparties to engage in opportunistic behavior and inefficiently consume a debtor’s limited assets. Because these two consequences may harm the debtor and its creditors, the safe harbors may merely substitute one kind of systemic risk for another. This Note argues that these safe harbors might more effectively combat systemic risk if they did not permit counterparties to terminate derivatives that are more valuable to the debtor. This is likely true of an insurance-like derivative known as the credit default swap (CDS). Just as insurance contracts may not be terminated — because maintaining insurance is crucial both to debtor rehabilitation and creditor protection — certain CDSs should not be eligible for termination under the safe harbors.

Whereas much of the extant literature has focused on the relationship between competition and the absolute level of risk of individual banks, in this paper we examine the correlation in the risk taking behavior of banks, hence systemic risk. The analysis finds that greater competition encourages banks to take on more diversified risks, making the banking system less fragile to shocks. Examining the impact of the institutional and regulatory environment on systemic stability shows that banking systems are more fragile in countries with weak supervision and private monitoring, high government ownership of banks, and in countries with public policies that restrict competition. Furthermore, lack of competition has a greater adverse effect on systemic stability in countries with generous safety nets and weak supervision.",,,1,41,Net interest income; Business; Systemic risk; Perfect competition; Bank regulation; Market discipline; Capital requirement; Barriers to entry; Financial system; Bank run,,,,,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/3267/1/WPS5981.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2364934_code579255.pdf?abstractid=2020584&mirid=3 https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3267/WPS5981.pdf?sequence=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2020584 https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/02/16220901/bank-competition-affect-systemic-stability https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/3267 https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-5981 https://documents.banquemondiale.org/curated/fr/943621468167965155/How-does-bank-competition-affect-systemic-stability http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/04/11/000158349_20120411082727/Rendered/PDF/WPS5981.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2364934_code579255.pdf?abstractid=2020584&mirid=1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-5981,,10.1596/1813-9450-5981,2155958625,,0,002-856-834-652-090; 003-149-711-513-422; 003-808-796-323-519; 004-391-489-299-809; 005-519-858-862-713; 006-654-812-851-865; 013-248-563-884-817; 014-010-914-304-340; 015-488-866-368-006; 017-208-519-781-22X; 017-486-496-247-162; 018-464-032-954-351; 019-567-175-265-391; 027-378-265-885-233; 028-467-189-000-94X; 030-306-352-344-019; 030-687-893-898-067; 032-564-497-549-263; 033-986-326-519-971; 035-036-887-869-30X; 035-571-732-473-946; 036-414-304-950-985; 037-530-557-213-718; 037-751-305-220-910; 040-720-401-106-866; 040-801-336-012-314; 041-612-583-019-955; 042-405-913-033-827; 045-537-347-039-282; 047-282-081-040-171; 050-039-925-983-742; 050-154-976-343-239; 054-260-384-126-569; 055-757-598-386-331; 060-040-167-116-658; 061-873-175-167-992; 064-168-585-704-549; 064-918-277-007-696; 069-308-776-594-956; 074-195-649-495-931; 074-730-108-664-263; 078-610-642-685-346; 079-911-040-533-682; 080-968-470-990-480; 081-151-194-776-364; 084-568-142-004-568; 084-570-242-067-235; 086-771-766-095-679; 087-052-046-278-94X; 087-286-227-882-478; 090-436-724-624-372; 098-140-332-366-819; 105-264-324-573-048; 108-156-475-400-399; 118-422-050-590-854; 122-117-435-157-596; 124-972-013-795-483; 128-221-806-202-631; 132-581-989-846-512; 134-960-691-657-121; 142-084-600-389-807; 144-910-395-886-066; 148-886-346-772-44X; 149-523-784-599-759; 164-495-336-277-906; 167-299-724-279-859; 168-632-570-447-305; 172-148-629-489-930; 173-498-880-660-976; 176-591-081-476-107,71,True,,green,lens

The development strategy of the firm or company must take into account various systemic and non-systemic risks and to minimize or avoid them, create the necessary financial sources in the form of reserves, collateral, insurance reserves and more. The reserve system of the enterprise provides for the official regulatory provision of funds to cover unforeseen expenses and losses, the creation of provisions for future expenses, the formation of reserves to cover doubtful and bad debts. In addition, companies can create and use hidden reserves, which are not provided by the accounting system and reporting, but play an important role in ensuring the activities of economic entities.Purpose. The main aim of the article is to analyze the structure and importance of different types of reserves and provisions, their role in stabilizing and effective activities of enterprises and corporations, determining the place of hidden reserves, providing suggestions on how to assess them.Method. The following methods are used in the research: monographic - to study the literature of the reservation system; regulatory support - to assess its availability and needs, compliance and violations; analytical - for analytical assessment of the feasibility of creating and efficient use of reserves and provisions; logical - for the purpose of legal and economic assessment of hidden reserves of enterprises and corporations.Results. An important means of protecting enterprises and corporations from systemic and non-systemic risks, including the consequences of a coronavirus pandemic, should be a rationally constructed backup system. It provides the formation of both open regulatory reserves and the search and use of hidden reserves and collateral. The interest of enterprises to increase the amount of open reserves can be achieved by reflecting in the balance sheet and other reporting of such sources in equity. In addition to the actual reserve capital created in accordance with the established standards through deductions from net income, hidden reserves and collateral must include unidentified collateral, when the time of occurrence of the relevant costs, their size, as well as the name of the creditor, or when payments for expected costs may not be known. The allocation of such reserves to equity will improve the estimated indicators of financial stability, investment attractiveness of economic entities. Among the hidden reserves should be distinguished reserves to improve the efficiency of economic activity, which are determined by the results of a detailed analysis of performance indicators. Certain resources may be released as a result of establishing an optimal accounting policy in the enterprise. Instead, it is necessary to timely identify and avoid concealment of the results of mismanagement, inaccurate presentation of information in accounting and reporting. Perspectives. Creating a reliable reserve system, its full information representation in accounting and reporting will protect companies from systemic and non-systemic risks, and the ability to objectively assess real and hidden reserves will allow real and potential investors to properly navigate in assessing the investment attractiveness of businesses.</jats:p>",,2,117,,Accounting; Business; Accounting information system,,,,,http://visnykj.wunu.edu.ua/index.php/htneu/article/viewFile/1230/1334,http://dx.doi.org/10.35774/visnyk2021.02.117,,10.35774/visnyk2021.02.117,3198127073,,0,041-941-303-287-742; 146-412-901-300-269,0,True,,bronze,lens

We build a simple model wherein banks interact via chains of repo contracts and use their proprietary collateral or re-use the collateral obtained by other banks via reverse repos. In this framework, we show that total collateral volume and its velocity are affected by characteristics of the network like the length of rehypothecation chains, the presence or not of chains having a cyclic structure, the direction of collateral flows, the density of the network. In addition, we show that structures where collateral flows are concentrated among few nodes (like in core-periphery networks) allow large increases in collateral volumes already with small network density. Furthermore, we introduce in the model collateral hoarding rates determined according to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) criterion, and we then study the emergence of collateral hoarding cascades in different networks. Our results highlight that network structures with highly concentrated collateral flows are also more exposed to large collateral hoarding cascades following local shocks.

Under the assumption that shocks are small, we provide a fairly complete characterization of the structure of equilibrium, clarifying the role of network interactions in translating microeconomic shocks into macroeconomic outcomes. This characterization enables us to rank different networks in terms of their aggregate performance.

179-884-465-087-248,Empirical aspects of financial stability,2018-04-15,2018.0,dissertation,,,,,Thorsten Riedle,"This thesis discusses the empirical aspects of financial stability and presents evidence that suggests that stock market bubbles and volatility are related, and that financial crises are also triggered by events related to non-financial sectors. Financial crises are predominantly related to boom episodes and asset price bubbles, which can seriously impact the financial system when they burst. This thesis draws upon the findings of previous papers and argues that the risk of financial instability (systemic risk) is formed during the boom phase and materialises on the eruption of crisis. In so doing, this study considers stock market bubbles as a potential source of risk for financial stability.; The severe impact on the economy in the wake of the recent financial crisis has not only demonstrated the way in which trouble in a relatively small market can escalate into a serious crisis exerting economy-wide effects, but is also an example of the important role financial stability plays in the functioning of modern economies. Chapter 1 addresses factors that contribute to financial crises and policy tools to mitigate their effects. The Global Financial Stability Map (Map), summarising and graphically presenting underlying factors that may lead to a systemic threat, shows the complex interactions among different factors that affect each other and, in combination, are relevant to financial stability. In this connection, the importance of countercyclicality is addressed and the weaknesses of the Value at Risk (VaR) measure are discussed. ; Chapter 2 examines whether longer periods of low volatility influence the formation of bubbles, which are defined as the difference between current prices and an adaptive moving average of an alternate history of asset prices, and whether stock market bubbles increase the likelihood of stock market crashes. The regression analysis employed confirms that longer episodes of low realised volatility exerts a significant influence on the formation of stock market bubbles, which, in turn, significantly increase the likelihood of stock market crises. This relationship is referred to as volatility paradox. Furthermore, the bubble is incorporated to inflate Value at Risk, in order to generate a countercyclical capital buffer for extreme events. It is shown that the inflated VaR covers the majority of the extreme negative returns. This leads to the conclusion that the information content of bubbles should be taken into account while measuring risk in stock markets.; The recent financial crisis revealed that even relatively small markets of the economy are capable of jeopardising financial stability, and the objective of Chapter 3 is to assess the contribution of both financial and non-financial sectors of an economy to systemic risk. For this purpose, the marginal systemic risk contribution, measured by ?CoVaR of 10 sectors, is estimated for the US, the UK, and Germany, through the employment of quantile regressions. The estimated ?CoVaRs are tested for significance and dominance in order to classify sectors as systemically relevant and to obtain a formal ranking of the sectors in terms of contribution to systemic risk. The outcomes reveal a weak link between VaR and ?CoVaR and significant externalities of sectors. Chapter 3 discusses the role of low volatility in excessive risk-taking and lending behaviour during booms as well as the deleveraging behaviour during bust episodes. It argues that countercyclical tools, which reduce such behaviour, can successfully mitigate financial crises. This line of argumentation is related to the countercyclical capital buffer discussed in Chapter 2, which is aimed at dampening the upward movements of asset prices. Taking into account the finding that real economy sectors also have significant effects on systemic risk, Chapter 3 proposes the application of macroprudential policy tools individually to those sectors in which bubbles emerge.; Chapter 4 compares the realised volatility levels between international stock markets. Although the volatility patterns are fairly similar, the pairwise t-test reveals a significant difference between the volatility levels of national stock markets. A two component GARCH-MIDAS model is applied to decompose conditional volatility into a short-run and a long-run volatility component and to link macroeconomic variables directly with stock market volatility. The outcomes of the GARCH-MIDAS model indicate that stock market volatility is associated with macroeconomic variables, and that stock market volatility depends upon different variables in different countries. Realised volatility is found to explain a considerable proportion of conditional volatility. The Granger causality test reveals no significant causal relationship of volatility with illiquidity or with sentiment.",,,,,Granger causality; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial crisis; Deleveraging; Stock market; Monetary economics; Stock (geology); Volatility (finance); Value at risk,,,,,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/66808/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.739534,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/66808/,,,2872875565,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Suppose (X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A relevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of influence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways. In this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t] called Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t] called Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of risk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance, insurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under the assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and asymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful model classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive the asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to infinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in the models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this reflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains significant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce an extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and MES for high thresholds t where little data are available. We show that these estimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and real data sets.",,,,,Consistency (statistics); Extrapolation; Systemic risk; Extreme value theory; Econometrics; Estimator; Scale (descriptive set theory); Mathematics; Independence (probability theory); Expected shortfall,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1603.09406.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1603.09406 https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/arxpapers/1603.09406.htm,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1603.09406.html,,,3123905467,,0,,0,False,,,lens
079-148-297-632-313,Time consistency for scalar multivariate risk measures,2018-10-11,2018.0,,arXiv: Risk Management,,,,Zachary Feinstein; Birgit Rudloff,"In this paper we present results on dynamic multivariate scalar risk measures, which arise in markets with transaction costs and systemic risk. Dual representations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to obtain the main results of this paper on time consistency; namely, an equivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to multiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of multivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets with transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal (1995), Roux and Zastawniak (2016), Loehne and Rudloff (2014)) does not satisfy the usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in (Feinstein and Rudloff (2020)), scalar risk measures with the same scalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The deduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time consistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires consideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a direct notion of a ""moving scalarization"" for scalar time consistency that corroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi-objective problems (Karnam, Ma, and Zhang (2017), Kovacova and Rudloff (2020)).",,,,,Time consistency; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Multivariate statistics; Risk measure; Mathematics; Scalar (physics),,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04978.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04978 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv181004978F/abstract,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04978,,,2897660831,,0,002-066-066-032-57X; 003-936-622-047-645; 005-030-250-952-450; 005-758-513-341-080; 006-320-797-383-302; 008-689-696-857-030; 009-076-310-251-007; 014-053-198-219-136; 014-403-726-793-957; 016-327-690-798-713; 018-248-651-680-656; 024-322-418-805-897; 024-943-160-230-29X; 027-256-688-004-017; 031-287-169-355-962; 031-292-614-757-780; 034-613-744-548-622; 035-231-433-338-524; 038-769-513-664-489; 039-650-162-527-463; 040-692-674-064-248; 042-572-006-442-764; 044-641-330-862-241; 046-590-043-474-188; 051-818-848-639-348; 053-329-447-892-831; 068-149-315-750-897; 068-926-087-240-142; 069-847-139-978-765; 072-622-917-376-068; 073-153-783-637-53X; 085-751-711-835-962; 086-861-898-357-449; 092-094-528-988-764; 092-885-097-009-456; 107-901-319-229-64X; 114-944-254-020-100; 116-055-564-283-822; 117-019-188-143-866; 122-281-393-785-31X; 125-310-543-361-109; 142-947-589-096-499; 143-479-558-855-300; 147-670-448-067-785; 150-131-233-965-911; 150-439-525-127-478; 153-268-726-676-954; 158-242-767-403-166; 162-248-768-229-296; 164-630-239-386-798; 167-800-976-805-727; 187-190-226-386-084,2,True,,,lens

The risk factors were divided into two groups: ocular and systemic. The ocular factors include refractive state, intraocular pressure, and cup-disk ratio of fellow eye. The systemic factors include diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The analysis revealed: (1) only 22.6% of patients with NAION have systemic risk factors; (2) intraocular pressure is not specific to NAION; (3) most of fellow eyes (72.6%) have cup-disk ratio not more than 0.1; and (4) most patients (90.9%) are hyperopic or emmetropic, only 9% of patients are myopic in either affected or fellow eyes. The statistical comparison between ocular (including cup-disk ratio and refractive state) and systemic factors is significant. The correlation with systemic factors in our study was not so high as previous study had reported. On the contrary, crowding effect of small cup-disk ratio, which induces a vicious circle of generally circulatory compromised disk, may play an important role in NAION. Besides, hyperopic or at least emmetropic eyes are more prone to NAION than myopic eyes. This may be due to lack of flattening of the temporal excavation, therefore adding a predisposing factor to a generally circulatory compromised disk. The risk factors associated with NAION seem more strongly correlated with ocular factors than with systemic factors.",14,4,221,225,Ophthalmology; Surgery; Retrospective cohort study; Emmetropia; Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Optic neuropathy; Intraocular pressure; Crowding effect; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,,"Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic/etiology; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/9589616 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9589616 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9589616/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9589616,9589616,,193518083,,0,,10,True,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold,lens

Ripple effects in housing prices of 10 major metropolitan areas in the USA between January 1993 and March 2016 are examined, and this study finds that intercity ripple effects are larger in lower-cost houses. In addition, ripple effects continue to increase after February 2015 only for the low-tier sample. This indicates that intercity systemic risk is currently highest for low-tier houses. Further estimations reveal that money supply is the most crucial variable for determining the level of systemic risk. However, because high-price-tier properties are prone to disposition effects when house prices fall, ripple effects tend to drop sharply during housing market downturns, except for during the subprime mortgage crisis.",63,1,1,24,Systemic risk; Subprime mortgage crisis; Metropolitan area; Economics; Variable (computer science); Ripple; Money supply; Sample (statistics); Monetary economics,,,,The Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:anresc:v:63:y:2019:i:1:d:10.1007_s00168-019-00916-z https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/anresc/v63y2019i1d10.1007_s00168-019-00916-z.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-019-00916-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00168-019-00916-z,,10.1007/s00168-019-00916-z,2944670739,,0,000-371-037-831-872; 001-476-660-081-505; 005-152-517-712-727; 006-585-412-814-09X; 007-066-783-625-230; 009-992-344-474-632; 011-656-165-748-369; 015-743-526-591-450; 018-209-668-854-462; 019-356-410-917-696; 023-667-516-920-888; 033-264-994-716-95X; 044-675-313-705-557; 048-112-191-614-88X; 048-190-289-740-562; 050-807-715-771-521; 058-174-779-759-293; 059-203-321-702-03X; 067-743-986-529-646; 074-802-372-089-093; 075-725-057-859-916; 079-952-922-807-279; 085-872-130-725-352; 090-511-634-226-255; 098-992-542-336-175; 102-147-296-857-622; 108-971-032-146-601; 118-852-373-093-764; 125-408-020-805-108; 139-379-989-024-215; 181-714-430-913-159; 193-356-872-455-536; 195-586-810-216-456,2,False,,,lens

The optimal contract will depend less on a correlated benchmark (e.g. a stock market index) if it is easier for the manager to misreport performance.

196-833-233-040-041,Does a Size Limit Resolve Too Big to Fail Problems,2013-07-01,2013.0,,Accounting and Taxation,1944592x,,,Mohamed Drira; Muhammad Rashid,"ABSTRACTDoes limiting the size of a large bank reduce its insolvency risk? This paper shows that the answer to this question depends on how exactly paring down of the bank size is done. In fact, the insolvency risk may go down or up depending on the composition of assets and liabilities of the bank relative to its pre-paring down composition. In addition, this study investigates mean-standard deviation efficiency of a typical Canadian large bank and its various possible paring down scenarios and finds both the original bank and its pared-down versions are inefficient. It then suggests mean-standard deviation efficient compositions of assets and liabilities, which do not depend on limiting the size of the bank. Therefore, the findings of this paper raise a serious doubt about the validity of the ""limit on size"" solution to the too-big-to-fail problem.JEL: G21, G01, G18KEYWORDS: Banking, Too-Big-To-Fail, Assets and Liabilities Management, Mean-Variance Analysis(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)INTRODUCTIONDuring and after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the term too-big-to-fail, to be denoted by TBTF hereafter, has been commonly used for a bank that is so large that its failure will trigger significant adverse financial and economic consequences for both financial and non-financial sectors (Ashcraft, 2005). These consequences termed the spillover effects, or systemic risk, were the main rationale behind governments' bailouts of large troubled banks in the USA and Europe during the crisis. The public rescue of a financially distressed large bank is known as the TBTF policy.The gains of the TBTF policy are the avoidance of the expected spillover effects and maintenance of financial stability, but this policy involves both short-run and long-run costs. Johnson and Kwak (2010) and King (2009), among others, argue that TBTF policy creates moral hazard problem and thereby encourages excessive risk-taking and inefficiency in resource allocation in the long-run. In addition, with the TBTF policy, the frequency of future financial crises is expected to rise, which will entail more significant financial and real costs (Goodlet, 2010). The short-run costs of the TBTF policy consist of the bailout funds which are a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to financial industry. Stem and Feldman (2009a) report that long-run costs were three times the short-run costs of rescuing the savings and loans associations in the USA in the 1980s. Because of the short-run and long-run costs and competitive nonneutrality in favor of large banks of the TBTF policy, this policy is termed to be the TBTF problem.Various measures have been proposed to tackle the TBTF problem such as, limit on size, tax on profit of TBTF banks, improving bank governance, raising capital adequacy requirements for TBTF banks, and embedded contingent capital (for a comparative evaluation of all the possible solutions to the TBTF problem that have been covered in the extant literature, see Rashid et al., 2012). Among these measures, the ""limit on size"" solution has been more popular in policy and academic circles. In Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, U.K, and USA, calls have been heard to cap the size of domestic banks (Dermine and Schoenmaker, 2010). A sample of prominent observers who have promoted limiting the size of large financial institutions are Reich (2008), Schultz (2008), Greenspan (see Buiter, 2009), Drucker (see Dickson, 2010), King, Ex-exchequer U.K (see Treanor, 2009), Johnson and Kwak (2010), and Moosa (2010).As stated by Stern and Feldman (2009b), the size limit solution has seemingly two attractive features that make it more popular and appearing easy to implement in practice. First, a bank's size is easily measurable. Second, the regulator can simply order across-the-board shrinkage of balance sheets for TBTF banks. However, a deeper analysis shows that the difficulties in implementing the ""limit on size"" solution are more serious than pretended by many of its advocates. …",5,2,65,77,Financial economics; Financial services; Systemic risk; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Balance sheet; Financial crisis; Bailout; Moral hazard; Too big to fail,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ibf:acttax:v:5:y:2013:i:2:p:65-77 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3109725381/does-a-size-limit-resolve-too-big-to-fail-problems https://ideas.repec.org/a/ibf/acttax/v5y2013i2p65-77.html http://www.theibfr2.com/RePEc/ibf/acttax/at-v5n2-2013/AT-V5N2-2013-6.pdf,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ibf:acttax:v:5:y:2013:i:2:p:65-77,,,346485475,,0,004-609-955-797-725; 008-712-456-504-95X; 014-513-763-463-25X; 017-731-317-988-202; 020-210-204-087-795; 022-364-682-385-273; 023-642-922-248-731; 024-828-296-919-906; 035-821-379-237-107; 051-643-166-752-456; 068-303-174-202-24X; 078-837-660-080-558; 100-827-589-804-811; 106-714-850-007-793; 113-024-435-703-56X; 113-104-322-748-294; 120-479-794-822-485; 131-031-197-904-697; 132-260-384-475-272; 156-526-627-332-628; 197-158-784-937-381,0,False,,,lens

Despite its potential, demand has remained low in many early experiments and field trials. Little research has been done, however, on demand for insurance as it is coupled with other services such as loans. Here, willingness to pay for drought index insurance backed loans is investigated using contingent valuation methodology. Results demonstrate that on average the sample population has a willingness to pay high enough to sustain a market viable insured loan product without subsidization with 56% of the target population expressing a willingness to pay for an insured loan at the market price. Results also show a positive and significant WTP for individual policies and to avoid basis risk resulting from rainfall measurement.",,,,,Public economics; Business; Systemic risk; Basis risk; Willingness to pay; Loan; Contingent valuation; Index (economics); Product (business); Market price,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/aaea15/205696.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/aaea15/205696.html,,,3021604274,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Arruda,"<jats:p>Easier accessibility and demand for so-called last chance tourism has contributed to rapid growth in Arctic cruise ship tourism. Arctic cruising brings many benefits to remote coastal communities but also presents an array of risks. In the light of this context, this article explores the concept of systemic risk of cruise ship incidents in general, findings which are then placed in an Arctic context and consideration given of the role the insurance sector may play in addressing cruise ship incidents. The study is based on metadata, both from academic and nonacademic sources. Findings are drawn from 11 global case studies of cruise ship incidents, 5 of which are polar examples. In the worst-case scenario, an array of serious economic, business, environmental, sociocultural, and security impacts may unfold in the Arctic, presenting risks that may be considerably worse than in other parts of the world. Arctic-specific challenges include extreme weather conditions and the presence of sea-ice, navigation and communication conditions, and lack of infrastructure (port facilities, Search and Rescue capabilities). Significant knowledge gaps across the Arctic have been identified, for example, in terms of seabed mapping, how to deal with industry-related activities, and the risks and nature of environmental change. When cruise ship risks in the Arctic are considered, both passenger and shipowner risk need to be accounted for, including Search and Rescue cover. Although data are limited, there is evidence that the sociocultural risks of an Arctic cruise ship incident are insufficiently addressed, either via insurance mechanisms or cross-border, navigational safety guidelines such as the Polar Code. The academic contribution of the study is the systemic scale of the analysis, and the practical and political implications are to lay the foundation for solution discussion that is of relevance in an Arctic and insurance context.</jats:p>",9,1,,,Systemic risk; Perspective (graphical); Geography; Cruise; Arctic; Environmental planning,,,,,https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article/9/1/00009/118040/Systemic-risk-of-cruise-ship-incidents-from-an,http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2020.00009,,10.1525/elementa.2020.00009,3180740394,,0,004-332-761-045-251; 006-192-235-010-009; 006-667-796-123-376; 008-314-915-547-235; 009-381-283-473-704; 010-547-331-239-65X; 010-685-886-593-578; 011-178-832-107-714; 011-324-253-842-661; 014-142-266-851-470; 015-117-209-694-108; 016-814-178-473-029; 017-644-953-938-059; 017-724-195-861-338; 017-741-830-753-593; 018-041-889-291-986; 019-571-972-961-404; 022-791-846-121-220; 028-188-459-521-146; 030-403-200-407-054; 032-946-118-612-896; 035-581-511-625-634; 038-354-305-619-03X; 039-890-264-363-597; 041-468-168-170-89X; 047-970-631-393-780; 048-221-704-297-932; 048-482-387-780-44X; 049-114-709-629-724; 050-420-467-488-420; 050-861-129-466-29X; 053-550-213-441-969; 053-849-661-254-231; 056-340-281-022-436; 057-715-324-746-712; 059-647-491-317-350; 059-648-596-545-645; 067-973-644-552-655; 068-250-025-152-123; 077-652-297-346-659; 079-419-986-878-10X; 080-553-503-792-233; 080-638-391-401-199; 081-310-185-831-806; 083-923-115-080-407; 084-079-501-829-506; 086-169-120-289-122; 087-190-153-673-609; 089-105-101-384-77X; 091-224-765-539-918; 094-220-235-524-947; 100-528-064-961-830; 102-019-530-939-874; 107-118-364-594-529; 107-635-465-168-997; 110-149-709-846-833; 122-629-791-706-554; 126-601-266-772-597; 133-548-713-960-711; 142-695-001-120-403; 145-091-642-292-514; 191-749-902-579-105,2,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Further, we quantify the effect on financial stability in a model of interbank networks with liquidity withdrawal. We find that the NBAs led to a concentration of interbank deposits at both the city and the bank level, creating systemically important banks in major financial centers.

Results suggest that market illiquidity, as measured by bid-ask spreads and a new Bloomberg measure, is a strong and statistically significant driver of price volatility in European bonds during both periods. Concentration of holdings by one sector has a significant upward effect on volatility only during the recent Bund Tantrum. During both periods, we can show that households, money market funds and other financial intermediaries engaged in procyclical selling of bonds, while banks and pension funds have been contrarian investors. We sketch how liquidity shocks and concentration can impact financial stability in the euro area, through several amplification channels and the investment behavior of different sectors.

The conceptual principle and methodological techniques behind the mechanisms involved [in such dynamics] have been harder to grasp than researchers understood them to be. In this paper, we show how to construct a large variety of behaviors by applying a simple algorithm to networked agents, which could, conceivably, offer a straightforward way out of the complexity. The model starts with the probability that systemic risk spreads. Even in a very random social structure, the propagation of risk is guaranteed by an arbitrary network property of a set of elements. Despite intensive systemic risk, the potential of the absence of failure could also be driven when there has been a strong investment in protection through a heuristically evolved protection level. It is very interesting to discover that many applications are still seeking the mechanisms through which networked individuals build many of these protection process or mechanisms based on fitness due to evolutionary drift. Our implementation still needs to be polished against what happens in the real world, but in general, the approach could be useful for researchers and those who need to use protection dynamics to guard against systemic risk under intrinsic randomness in artificial circumstances.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Systemic risk; Computer science,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11622 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190711622P/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11622,https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11622,,,2966704991,,0,002-247-793-205-679; 004-682-225-354-448; 008-532-975-744-973; 008-773-898-306-597; 012-016-136-020-88X; 018-975-331-902-441; 019-411-385-852-219; 021-239-481-297-147; 024-953-859-303-113; 026-490-576-145-711; 026-567-979-322-906; 027-508-890-446-810; 032-966-446-271-531; 035-987-434-598-176; 036-432-387-214-025; 036-437-824-130-368; 039-987-850-341-156; 042-186-830-103-749; 047-951-368-055-675; 048-466-370-963-397; 051-296-115-852-621; 054-063-769-408-521; 057-445-319-191-751; 061-871-987-984-921; 063-173-438-249-136; 063-190-811-897-241; 069-469-328-299-205; 069-552-634-797-138; 075-056-758-468-39X; 084-261-081-444-976; 090-355-489-501-836; 092-585-411-488-957; 093-880-452-664-935; 096-169-731-559-884; 098-950-277-295-601; 100-571-373-075-14X; 105-155-068-520-357; 108-391-001-538-433; 120-708-485-123-820; 123-478-081-380-503; 123-828-705-118-421; 126-111-070-540-135; 152-650-640-468-872,0,True,,,lens

This requires that the holders of bail-in able debt have the capacity of absorbing losses but also that the application of bail-in does is consistent with financial stability. Sophisticated investors have typically a larger financial capacity than unsophisticated investors but they are also more reactive to information and/or imposition of losses and are therefore more likely to generate runs and systemic risk. In contrast, retail investors are slower movers and as such they constitute a more stable source of funding. As a result, we do not advocate the ban of the sale of subordinated debt to retail investors. Rather, it is crucial that the rules concerning the marketing of these products are appropriately designed and their implementation is supervised by competent authorities.",,,,,Debt; Business; Systemic risk; Marketing; Subordinated debt; Market discipline; Financial stability,,,,,,,,,2510028184,,0,,0,False,,,lens

091-104-939-789-188,"Essays on big data, financial risk and forecasting",,,,,,,,Arpita Mukherjee,"This dissertation is composed of two separate yet closely linked essays in the ﬁeld of ﬁnancial econometrics, dealing with one unifying theme; modeling and forecasting ﬁnancial risk using high-frequency ﬁnancial time series data. The ﬁrst essay aims to shed light on the efficacy of using alternative estimation and testing methodologies related to volatility, jumps, and co-jumps in the ﬁnancial markets. The second essay on the other hand provides insight into the marginal predictive and economic gains associated with using density and point forecasts for directional volatility prediction. ; ; In recent years, the ﬁeld of ﬁnancial econometrics has seen tremendous gains in the amount of data available for use in modeling and prediction. Much of this data is very high frequency, and even “tick-based”, and hence falls into the category of what might be termed as big data. The availability of such data has spurred numerous theoretical advances, especially in the areas of volatility (risk) estimation and prediction, and price jump and co-jump detection. Successful risk management, asset pricing, and asset allocation, all depend signiﬁcantly on asset-return volatility dynamics and discontinuous asset price movements (jumps). Moreover, co-jumps reﬂect market correlation and are instrumental in identifying systemic risk across multiple sectors and markets. Thus, in the first essay of this dissertation, we begin with a survey of numerous non-parametric estimators of integrated volatility and testing methodologies used to analyze asset-price jumps and co-jumps. Thereafter, to illustrate the ﬁnite sample properties of the competing methods discussed in this essay, we carry out an empirical analysis using stock prices of DOW 30 companies and ETFs. With a sampling period of more than a decade, covering the 2008-2009 ﬁnancial crisis, our empirical investigation reveals commonalities and statistical differences in volatility movement, jump, and co-jump activities as depicted by the different estimators and tests. For instance, jump-robust volatility estimators and the volatility estimator robust to neither jumps nor noise, report similar continuous asset price movements, only when the jump-robust volatility estimator utilizes a data-driven truncation approach to eliminate jumps above a certain threshold. Certain jump detection methodologies are found to indicate more frequent jumps after the ﬁnancial crisis period (post-2009), thus signifying the over-detection of “small” and “moderate” jumps during the said period. Finally, co-jump tests which utilize results at the intersection of two jump tests, report a higher percentage of days identiﬁed as having co-jumps, possibly due to a larger false rejection rate. ; ; In the second essay, we provide new empirical evidence of the relative usefulness of interval (density) and point forecasts of asset-return volatility, in the context of ﬁnancial risk management. In our evaluation, we utilize both statistical criteria, i.e. accuracy of directional volatility predictions, and economic criteria i.e. proﬁtability of trading strategies based on said predictions. We construct interval forecasts using non-parametric kernel estimators, while point forecasts are based on “linear” heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models as well as “nonlinear” deep-learning recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Additionally, we utilize a novel trading strategy that builds on the contemporaneous return-volatility relationship and leads to new insights related to linkages between economic and statistical methods of forecast evaluation. Our empirical ﬁndings based on high-frequency data suggest that interval forecasts can improve upon point forecasts in terms of trading proﬁtability, regardless of the “linear” or “nonlinear” nature of the point-forecasting model. Moreover, interval forecasts perform better than linear model-based point forecasts, when it comes to directional predictive accuracy. These ﬁndings are consistent with hypotheses concerning both nonlinear volatility dynamics and the ability of interval forecasts to accurately estimate “large price jump” induced future volatility movements. We conduct a follow-up series of Monte Carlo experiments, which are motivated by our ﬁnding that for translation of statistical improvements into economic gains, the choice of volatility estimation technique is crucial. Our experiments reveal that the inability of certain volatility estimators to accurately predict “pseudo true” volatility density for speciﬁc magnitudes of “price jumps” or “microstructure noise” in the price process, can explain why these same estimators are less proﬁtable when used in our empirical trading strategies.Ph.D.Includes bibliographical reference",,,,,Financial economics; Economics; Big data; Financial risk; Volatility (finance),,,,,https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/64956/,http://dx.doi.org/10.7282/t3-54br-jm18,,10.7282/t3-54br-jm18,3127058831,,0,,0,False,,,lens
010-697-861-061-442,Alternative Compensation Mechanisms as Remedies for Uninsurability of Liability,2004-07-01,2004.0,journal article,The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance - Issues and Practice,10185895; 14680440,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Germany,Michael Faure,"One of the crucial issues resulting from expanding liability risks is whether alternative compensation mechanisms, other than (liability) insurance might be better able to cover socalled uninsured risks. Generally it is held in the literature that the issues that threaten the insurability of (liability) insurance today (uncertainty concerning probability and damage, causal uncertainty, retroactivity issues) would also affect other compensation mechanisms. Indeed, it is often held, for instance, that the general idea that no matter what type of compensation system one looks for it should always be organized in such a manner that the one who creates the risk should also bear the financial consequences, is an element which is crucial for every type of compensation mechanism. Hence, the question arises whether the reasons for uninsurability in traditional (liability) insurance could be removed if one would seek alternative compensation mechanisms. This question is warranted, especially after the Twin Towers incident of 11 September 2001 which indicated that catastrophes can occur that largely outweigh the capacity of traditional insurance undertakings. Therefore in this paper I will on the one hand analyse whether insurance compensation mechanisms other than traditional liability insurance would be better able to cover ‘‘uninsurable’’ risks under some circumstances. In addition, I would like to examine whether other financial arrangements (this is different from insurance) would be able to provide financial compensation if risks remained uninsured through the traditional insurance markets. In that respect the question obviously arises why other compensation mechanisms would be better able to cover those particular risks than insurance. In this paper I will look at some of these alternative mechanisms, not only from an insurance theoretical point of view, but also by looking at some actual compensation mechanisms which have been used in practice.

I introduce a new measure based on the harmonic distance of Acemoglu et al. (2015) and, motivated by their theoretical results, compare it to well-known centrality measures already applied in the systemic risk literature which do not take into account the structure of a contagion mechanism. I derive an explicit formula of size-adjusted harmonic distances and extend it with the usage of liquid assets for a heterogeneous banking system. The simulation results on scale-free and complete networks do not confirm that this new distance would perform better than ""off-the-shelf"" measures but its performance becomes similar to the best known measures in case of averaged networks which are applied in central banking analysis. This new measure is capable of identifying systemically important institutions and its time variation is also presented in an interbank network. I also test for the scale-free property of the Hungarian interbank lending network and besides, network measures as systemic risk indicators are analyzed on Hungarian data.",,,,,Financial economics; Stability (learning theory); Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Interbank lending market; Measure (mathematics); Financial networks; Interbank network; Macroprudential regulation; Centrality,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mnb/wpaper/2017-1.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mnb/wpaper/2017-1.html,,,2580818729,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Weiß; Janina Muhlnickel,"Abstract Are some insurers relevant for the stability of the financial system? And if yes, what firm fundamentals and aspects of insurers’ business models cause them to destabilize an entire financial sector? We find that several insurers did indeed contribute significantly to the instability of the U.S. financial sector during the recent financial crisis. We empirically confirm that insurers that were most exposed to systemic risk were on average larger, relied more heavily on non-policyholder liabilities and had higher ratios of investment income to net revenues.

The key to disaster decision-making is how to manage risk and uncertainty. Uncertainty in a disaster is not simply a matter of choosing one of several options, but the options themselves change dynamically depending on the situation. The combination of options that can be taken will also affect the risk posed by uncertainty. VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) is a term used to describe a situation such as a large-scale disaster, which is difficult to predict, complex, and uncertain. In a VUCA situation, the traditional problem-solving approach of grasping the overall risk situation and examining the optimal solution from among all the possible options is often simply not possible. Various risks are interrelated, and a slight change in the situation can transform the overall risk. Decision-making in such a systemic risk model requires a risk-based approach, starting from what is the risk to oneself, structuring and understanding the risks surrounding oneself, and identifying what information is necessary to minimize the risk. In this chapter, we will use these concepts to illustrate the difficulties in decision-making during disasters and discuss the information that should be collected and utilized to reduce risks in health management during disasters.KeywordsInformationDecision-makingVUCASystemic riskRisk-based approach",,,263,272,Ambiguity; Risk analysis (engineering); Structuring; Risk management; Computer science; Factor analysis of information risk; Key (lock); Business; Risk management information systems; Information system; Engineering; Computer security; Management information systems; Finance; Electrical engineering; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-98297-3_23,,10.1007/978-3-030-98297-3_23,,,0,004-049-740-084-717; 010-007-761-175-257; 026-774-028-413-273; 030-624-869-621-959; 039-952-336-655-662; 045-868-267-443-716; 106-402-539-585-539,0,False,,,lens

Eisner,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Nephrolithiasis is a common cause of morbidity with a 5-10% lifetime prevalence worldwide. Yearly expenditures in the United States exceed $2 billion. Previous epidemiologic analyses suggested an increase in the prevalence of stone disease in the United States from the 1970s to the 1990s. The current study examines the prevalence of nephrolithiasis in the United States, comparing stone prevalence data from the 1990s with that from 2007-2008. METHODS: History of kidney stone disease was assessed using the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III – 1988-1994 and NHANES 2007-2008). RESULTS: Over the past 2 decades, overall lifetime kidney stone prevalence increased for all participants (5.2% to 8.5%, p 0.001). Prevalence increased 69.4% for men (6.3% to 10.6%, p 0.001) and 50.0% for women (4.1% to 6.4%, p 0.001). Increases were seen in all racial/ethnic groups. Statistically significant increases in stone prevalence were seen whether patients had BMI 30 (5.2% to 8.0%), BMI 30 (6.8% to 10.7%), no diabetes mellitus (5.2% to 8.1%), diabetes mellitus (9.2% to 16.8%), no hypertension (4.3% to 7.0%), or hypertension (9.6% to 13.6%) (p 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Nephrolithiasis is increasing in the United States over the past 2 decades. Increased prevalence of nephrolithiasis was noted for patients with and without known systemic risk factors for nephrolithiasis.",187,4,,,Ethnic group; Demography; Kidney stones; Kidney stone disease; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHANES III; Stone disease; Lifetime prevalence; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,,,,,https://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347(12)02836-4/pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022534712028364 https://www.auajournals.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.juro.2012.02.2474,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2012.02.2474,,10.1016/j.juro.2012.02.2474,1970353409,,0,,1,False,,,lens

We apply the approach within an extensive agent based model to determine the macroeconomic consequences due to catastrophic events. The agent based approach is capable of modelling an entire national economy with all sectors, including households, firms and banks. It is based on an input-output model with 64 industries where all goods and services are produced endogenously. We show that without a copula approach only average annual losses on the country level would be available which limits analysis on long term effects. However, with the copula approach, which includes the estimation of basin scale loss distribution through catastrophe modelling, exposure estimation through Corine land cover mapping, assessment of appropriate copulas and parameter estimation, including an algorithm to couple coupled basins as well as an upscaling procedure to the country level, the whole risk spectrum can be estimated. The direct loss estimates from the copula approach, separated into different risk bearers, are used to build a damage scenario generator which gives the input for the agent based model. The agent based model in turn assesses the additional indirect losses due to the event which can be much larger than the direct losses alone. The agent based model is calibrated to the case of Austria at a scale 1: 10, e.g. with hundreds of thousands of agents and the agents are calibrated according to micro data, including business information, balance-sheets, and income statements. We show that there can be severe effects due to large scale natural disaster events through different transmission channels, even leading to systemic risks. This detailed information should be useful for determining risk management options on various scales.",,,,,Risk assessment; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Natural disaster; Copula (linguistics); Goods and services; Geography; Land cover; Agent-based model; Risk management,,,,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13875/,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13875/,,,2557672489,,0,043-492-443-839-555,0,False,,,lens

This study aims to quantify the degree of systemic risk in the agricultural markets under future climate change and evaluate the effects of trade liberalization when systemic risk exists. Simulation analysis, using computable general equilibrium (CGE) model based on harvest predictions from crop model and global climate model (GCM), suggests the following. (1) In rice, which has the largest synergistic effect of output fluctuation, the output synergy was significant in combinations of trading countries with more than 40%. (2) This synchronicity of yields increases fluctuations in agricultural production and agricultural price by 22% and 84%, respectively. (3) Although trade liberalization can alleviate the vulnerability of agricultural production under climate change, in countries with large imports of agricultural products, such mitigation effect on price fluctuation by trade liberalization declines due to systemic risk. Therefore, by taking into accounts the systemic risk under future climate change, it is necessary to examine the true effects of agricultural trade policies and prepare countermeasures in advance.",,,,,Agriculture; Agricultural productivity; Climate change; Systemic risk; Economics; Natural resource economics; Financial market; Computable general equilibrium; Food prices; Free trade,,,,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/10094.pdf https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=6008,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=6008,,,3036634572,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Thirty percent of epilepsy patients between the ages of 5 and 25 develop seizures related to illness or accidents involving an injury to the head. Decision making for prevention and care is crucial for fighting morbidity and mortality of such disease. Considering the multiplicity of diagnostic and treatment alternatives the best sequence of such alternatives should be the objective to detect for any pathologist and specialized physician in treating patients. Here, we introduce a portfolio decision model for the optimal detection of coupled diagnostic and treatment alternatives. The model is composed by two multicriteria decision analysis models which assess the risk of diagnostic and treatment alternatives as a function of alternative criteria, individual- and context-dependent criteria of patients. The minimization of the sequential risk considering all combinations of alternatives and their costs determine Pareto efficient frontiers that provide optimal solutions to decrease the mortality risk due to epilepsy for any resource level available. Preliminary results show that traditional diagnostic and treatment alternatives (i.e., EEG and ketogenic diet, respectively) are the highest scoring diagnostic alternative considering efficacy, potential risks of misdiagnosis, execution time, and time to process the results of the tests.This happens because of the limited data and application of the most recent innovative alternatives. The portfolio decision model is a very flexible model for formalizing pathology into systems pathology in a quantitative fashion. The approach is largely adoptable for any disease other than epilepsy and it makes physicians decision making transparent and quantitative based. The model emphasizes the strong importance to consider population health criteria, individual factors, and sequential decisions simultaneously for minimizing the systemic risk of diseases over time.",,,,,Pareto principle; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Operations management; Population health; Epilepsy; Disease; Portfolio; Decision model; Multi-objective optimization; Medicine,,,,,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/sequential-portfolio-decision-model-for-epilepsy-death-risk-reduc https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/iemssconference/2014/Stream-E/13 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/sequential-portfolio-decision-model-for-epilepsy-death-risk-reduction(277f5ce3-a394-4e43-a63c-75e4fa8c924d).html,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/sequential-portfolio-decision-model-for-epilepsy-death-risk-reduc,,,2295912358,,0,018-992-693-252-655; 023-200-881-981-444; 120-712-100-406-558; 140-098-001-211-016,0,False,,,lens

A drug-eluting bioresorbable stent (BRS) was thus developed as an alternative to DES, which can be absorbed entirely after its therapeutic period. Magnesium (Mg)-based BRSs have attracted a great deal of attention due to their suitable mechanical properties, innovative chemical features, and well-proven biocompatibility. However, the primary disadvantage of Mg-based BRSs is the rapid degradation rate, resulting in the early loss of structural support long before the recovery of vascular function. Recently, a new type of patented Mg–Nd–Zn-Zr alloy (JDBM) was developed at Shanghai Jiao Tong University to reduce the degradation rate compared to commercial Mg alloys. In the present investigation, a poly(d,l-lactic acid)-coated and rapamycin eluting (PDLLA/RAPA) JDBM BRS was prepared, and its biosafety and efficacy for coronary artery stenosis were evaluated via in vitro and in vivo experiments. The degree of smooth muscle cell adhesion to the PDLLA/RAPA coated alloy and the rapamycin pharmacokinetics of JDBM BRS were first assessed in vitro. JDBM BRS and commercial DES FIREHAWK were then implanted in the coronary arteries of a porcine model. Neointimal hyperplasia was evaluated at 30, 90, and 180 days, and re-endothelialization was evaluated at 30 days. Furthermore, Micro-CT and optical coherence tomography (OCT) analyses were performed 180 days after stent implantation to evaluate the technical feasibility, biocompatibility, and degradation characteristics of JDBM BRS in vivo. The results show the ability of a PDLLA/RAPA coated JDBM to inhibit smooth muscle cell adhesion and moderate the drug release rate of JDBM BRS in vitro. In vivo, low local and systemic risks of JDBM BRS were demonstrated in the porcine model, with preserved mechanical integrity after 6 months of implantation. We also showed that this novel BRS was associated with a similar efficacy profile compared with standard DES and high anti-restenosis performance. These findings may confer long term advantages for using this BRS over a traditional DES.",11,1,7330,7330,Biomedical engineering; In vivo; Biocompatibility; Drug-eluting stent; Neointimal hyperplasia; Stent; Coronary arteries; Revascularization; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Medicine,,"Alloys; Animals; Aorta, Thoracic/pathology; Cell Adhesion; Containment of Biohazards; Coronary Angiography/methods; Coronary Restenosis; Coronary Vessels/drug effects; Drug-Eluting Stents; Magnesium/chemistry; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology; Neodymium/chemistry; Patient Safety; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Polyesters/chemistry; Rats; Sirolimus/pharmacology; Stress, Mechanical; Swine; Tomography, Optical Coherence; X-Ray Microtomography; Zinc/chemistry; Zirconium/chemistry",Alloys; Polyesters; Neodymium; poly(lactide); Zirconium; Magnesium; Zinc; Sirolimus,"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; medical-engineering cross fund of Shanghai Jiao Tong University",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795781/ http://www-nature-com-443.webvpn.bjmu.tsg211.com/articles/s41598-021-86803-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016955 http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33795781/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatSR..11.7330Z/abstract https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86803-0 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-110813/v1.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33795781 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-86803-0.pdf https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-110813/v1 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8016955,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-86803-0,33795781,10.1038/s41598-021-86803-0,3110458864,PMC8016955,0,002-258-024-064-764; 002-814-868-518-492; 002-845-770-210-627; 006-828-548-535-261; 009-462-209-325-708; 010-545-829-488-902; 010-748-450-652-026; 010-926-982-478-857; 011-495-469-598-879; 013-380-008-773-964; 016-323-965-125-262; 017-909-261-320-937; 021-280-482-922-172; 022-725-890-760-294; 023-242-328-029-963; 026-239-691-041-125; 026-360-485-616-068; 027-816-652-790-725; 028-140-681-835-610; 029-930-920-949-299; 032-284-276-838-217; 036-223-296-742-796; 036-261-516-962-377; 036-853-555-872-891; 039-930-266-071-524; 050-483-432-723-45X; 051-321-125-750-743; 051-947-295-302-745; 052-399-964-317-453; 053-243-461-280-615; 056-412-940-012-486; 058-207-215-674-188; 062-061-105-985-095; 064-828-576-456-10X; 066-566-980-327-495; 069-226-679-989-172; 069-909-611-367-214; 069-974-553-214-949; 070-454-238-520-053; 072-507-491-251-466; 076-524-202-085-650; 078-718-149-579-042; 084-839-064-476-560; 086-980-487-011-381; 087-307-283-039-143; 087-628-463-760-656; 098-614-995-819-497; 102-965-126-165-257; 109-623-310-594-89X; 116-852-137-092-564; 122-599-428-798-066; 139-787-805-487-171; 140-454-393-487-748; 161-252-972-773-411,6,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Die Gruppe hat ihren Bericht am 25. Februar 2009 vorgelegt. Kapitel III des Berichts behandelt das Aufsichtssystem auf EU-Ebene und gelangt im Wesentlichen zu zwei Empfehlungen: - Errichtung einer praventiv tatigen, institutsubergreifenden („macroprudential“) Aufsichtseinrichtung mit dem Namen „European Systemic Risk Council“ [ESRC] - Umwandlung der bestehenden Ebene-3 Ausschusse („3L3 committees“) in ein neues europaisches System von Finanzaufsicht [ESFS] mit hoheitlichen Funktionen Vor allem die geforderte Neustrukturierung der Aufsicht ist unter verschiedenen Gesichtspunkten kritisch zu wurdigen. Die Erwagungen konzentrieren sich dabei auf die Frage, ob die Umsetzung der Vorschlage ohne Anderung des primaren Gemeinschaftsrechts moglich erscheint. Der Abschluss von separaten Verwaltungsabkommen oder von Staatsvertragen, mit denen ad hoc neue Einrichtungen geschaffen werden konnten, soll im Folgenden nicht weiter untersucht werden. Zwar konnte auf diese Weise ein vollstandiger Rechtsrahmen fur Aufsichtseinrichtungen auf EU-Ebene geschaffen werden. Er konnte auch die Grundlage fur die Ubertragung von Hoheitsbefugnissen bilden, doch ware dies mit gravierenden Nachteilen verbunden. Es ist keineswegs sicher, dass alle Mitglieder der EU eine solche Vereinbarung unterzeichnen wurden, so dass unterschiedliche Aufsichtssysteme entstehen wurden. Einer der Hauptgrunde fur eine Aufsicht auf europaischer Ebene wurde verfehlt. Zum anderen wurde eine institutionelle Parallelstruktur im Kernbereich der EU, dem gemeinsamen Binnenmarkt mit den Grundfreiheiten, geschaffen, die zahlreiche gravierende Probleme der Koordination und Abstimmung zwischen diesen, voneinander unabhangigen Systemen hervorrufen wurde.",,,,,,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/imfswp/24.html https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:zbw:imfswp:24 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:imfswp:24,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/imfswp/24.html,,,2221851714,,0,,1,False,,,lens

In particular, several empirical studies have revealed that systemic risk can be created and transmitted by hedge funds, which are private investment funds that have historically evaded regulation under the federal securities laws. In response to the risk created by hedge funds, Congress granted the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) authority under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 to designate hedge funds as Systemically Important Financial Institutions (“SIFIs”). Such a designation would automatically result in stringent capital constraints and limitations on liquidity risk on these nonbank institutions. However, in the over six years since FSOC has been granted this authority, it has failed to identify even one hedge fund as a SIFI. The council has encountered a variety of challenges such as criticisms to systemic risk studies sanctioned by FSOC, and massive resistance to the SIFI designation process by numerous industry participants. If this designation were applied to hedge funds it would severely limit the abilities of hedge fund advisers to pursue certain strategies. For these reasons, it is highly unlikely that FSOC will designate a hedge fund as a SIFI.The inability of FSOC to regulate systemically harmful funds is particularly troubling because several post-financial crisis studies have revealed that systemic risk can still be created and transmitted by hedge funds. Given FSOC’s inability to close this hedge fund loophole, this Article argues that Congress should explore appointing the SEC as the primary regulator of systemically harmful funds because; (1) the transparency framework inherent in the federal securities laws can supply a more effective means for mitigating systemic risk than the prudential framework currently mandated for SIFIs, and (2) appointing the SEC in this regard would reduce the fragmentation of our current regulatory structure which has been extended and complicated by the creation of FSOC. While the federal securities laws are typically used to promote investor protection, this Article posits that enhancing transparency to hedge fund counterparties and investors can decrease systemic risk by empowering such market participants to better protect themselves against risk. Enhancing protection in this manner could in-turn weed out systemically harmful funds from the marketplace, without imposing the severe capital constraints that would be mandated under FSOC’s model. With respect to reducing the fragmentation of our current regulatory structure, this Article argues that lawmakers should dedicate resources to reforming our existing agencies instead of creating additional layers of ineffective regulation that could lead to repeated failures, undue complexities, and wasted resources.",58,2,639,702,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Liquidity risk; Financial market; Hedge fund; Investment (macroeconomics); Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Enforcement,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/cary-martin/30/ https://via.library.depaul.edu/lawfacpubs/1237/ https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3571&context=bclr https://works.bepress.com/cary-martin/30/download/ https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol58/iss2/6/,https://works.bepress.com/cary-martin/30/,,,3115792952,,0,,7,False,,,lens

Both suggest that the contagious risk arising from an assumed bank failure is trivial, whereas the amplification effects of the losses due to the financial interlinkage are non-trivial.",34,,101236,,Business; Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Vulnerability; China; Financial networks; Bank failure; Financial contagion; Interbank network; Monetary economics,,,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/90658/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S154461231930368X https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/finlet/v34y2020ics154461231930368x.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2019.07.009,,10.1016/j.frl.2019.07.009,2906306439,,0,015-330-084-659-28X; 023-920-010-872-504; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-582-421-227-58X; 031-344-537-376-598; 040-742-355-738-164; 048-260-813-735-366; 048-297-576-911-977; 054-293-409-557-957; 054-909-517-727-91X; 067-160-857-197-994; 069-972-601-367-511; 075-897-862-903-52X; 094-358-206-649-929; 122-102-443-580-78X; 155-402-052-450-031,17,True,,green,lens

The algorithm is tested against a default contagion algorithm on three ensembles of networks with increasing density, estimated from real-world banking data related to the largest 227 EU15 financial institutions indexed in a stock market. Results suggest that DebtRank is capable of capturing increasing rates of systemic risk in a more sensitive and continuous way, thereby acting as an early-warning signal. The paper proposes three policy instruments based on this approach: the monitoring of systemic risk over time by applying the augmented DebtRank on time snapshots of interbank networks, a stress-testing framework able to test the systemic importance of financial institutions on different shock scenarios, and the evaluation of distribution of systemic losses in currency value.",,,,,Finance; Currency; Systemic risk; Value (economics); Financial networks; Realm; Context (language use); Stock market; Computer science; Shock (economics),,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1412.html#Gurciullo14a https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1412.1679.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1412.1679 https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1679 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1679,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1412.html#Gurciullo14a,,,3124594279,,0,,0,True,,,lens

The underlying idea is that the economy as a whole will be destabilized, if the financial sector is completely left to market forces. Accordingly, proposals have been made to establish higher standards for the regulation of equity capital in the banking industry and to set rules of banking supervision which pay more attention to domino effects creating systemic risks. But these proposals ignore that banks were less leveraged in former times when regulation of equity capital did not yet exist; moreover, there is no historical evidence that more government intervention reduces instabilities in the financial sector. If the shareholders of leading banks had more control over their managers, the instability of the financial sector might be much more effectively contained than by stricter supervision and regulation.",,,,,Shareholder; Business; Systemic risk; Economic interventionism; Control (management); Banking industry; Financial sector; Market forces; Historical evidence; Financial system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/arqudp/81.html https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/30844/1/611352958.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:arqudp:81 https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/30844,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/arqudp/81.html,,,1557412347,,0,,0,False,,,lens

During periods of high hydrocarbon prices, favorable economic prospects make the financial sector keen to lend, leading to higher domestic credit growth and easier access to external financing. Fiscal policy is a very important tool for macroeconomic management, but due to the significant time lags and expenditure rigidities, it has not been a flexible enough tool to prevent credit booms and the build-up of systemic risk in the GCC. This, together with limited monetary policy independence because of the pegged exchange rate, means that macro-prudential policy has a particularly important role in limiting systemic risk in the financial system. This importance is reinforced by the underdeveloped financial markets in the region that provide limited risk management tools and shortcomings in crisis resolution frameworks. This paper will discuss the importance of macro-prudential policy in the GCC countries, look at the experience with macro-prudential policies in the boom/bust cycle in the second half of the 2000s, and use the broad frameworks being developed in the Fund and elsewhere to discuss ways existing frameworks and policy toolkits in the region can be strengthened given the characteristics of the GCC economies.",,,,,Economic policy; Monetary policy; Business; Systemic risk; Economic sector; Financial market; Exchange rate; External financing; Commodity; Fiscal policy; Financial system,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/Macroprudential-Policy-Countries-Zsofia-Arvai-ebook/dp/B00KMSQAIG https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1401.pdf https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/006/2014/001/article-A001-en.xml https://www.elibrary.imf.org/doc/IMF006/20672-9781484334430/20672-9781484334430/Other_formats/Source_PDF/20672-9781475527735.pdf,https://www.amazon.com/Macroprudential-Policy-Countries-Zsofia-Arvai-ebook/dp/B00KMSQAIG,,,562901593,,0,012-416-083-784-386; 025-821-732-006-228; 032-044-335-343-837; 038-436-090-750-311; 045-270-832-632-020; 051-254-983-398-523; 067-628-997-258-948; 092-320-632-498-362; 094-909-854-173-533; 110-780-782-278-996; 126-964-475-713-772; 127-043-901-162-505; 140-349-861-178-766; 155-330-219-797-433; 180-528-330-194-534; 186-943-944-813-834,4,False,,,lens

Banks’ holdings of sovereign debt build a network of financial linkages with European countries that exhibits a long-tail distribution of node degrees. A highly connected network core of 15 banks is identified. These banks accounted for the majority of sovereign debt investments between December 2010 and December 2013 but exhibited only average and sometimes even below average capitalizations. Consequently, they constituted a potential source and transmission channel of systemic risk, especially due to their proneness to portfolio contagion. In a complementary regression analysis, the effect of counterparty risk on Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads of 15 EU sovereigns is investigated. Among the banks exposed to the debt of a particular issuer, the biggest institutions in terms of their own asset sizes are identified and some of their balance sheet characteristics included into the regression. The analysis finds that the banks’ implied volatilities had a significant and increasing effect on CDS spreads during the recent crisis years, providing evidence of the presence of counterparty risk and its effect on EU sovereign debt pricing. Furthermore, the role of the domestic financial sectors is assessed and found to have affected the CDS spreads.",3,3,244,279,Debt; Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Internal debt; Portfolio; European union; Credit default swap; External debt; Financial system,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7072/3/3/244/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7072/3/3/244 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:gam:jijfss:v:3:y:2015:i:3:p:244-279:d:53101 https://doaj.org/article/bc512284c54746d88f8b99acc5013c6f https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jijfss/v3y2015i3p244-279d53101.html https://econpapers.repec.org/article/gamjijfss/v_3a3_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a244-279_3ad_3a53101.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijfs3030244,,10.3390/ijfs3030244,1603078470,,0,001-274-723-652-948; 004-682-225-354-448; 004-969-538-054-17X; 005-204-459-316-321; 008-779-198-451-846; 015-747-077-507-142; 016-798-036-818-696; 017-879-639-284-727; 024-538-068-782-439; 027-850-377-267-815; 028-529-933-272-558; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-306-352-344-019; 038-472-900-446-513; 038-566-294-724-874; 039-005-535-503-64X; 042-387-243-987-771; 046-702-361-910-006; 047-325-472-840-931; 051-564-024-635-830; 051-953-212-619-722; 055-957-363-052-667; 057-425-306-078-065; 062-942-993-659-510; 068-623-362-943-689; 070-614-396-564-561; 070-822-422-524-333; 076-307-007-126-663; 077-436-811-650-375; 077-525-074-871-112; 078-597-394-303-885; 101-100-172-554-705; 102-493-287-318-901; 109-381-535-599-334; 114-080-211-575-67X; 116-327-783-464-857; 119-031-570-848-300; 124-079-689-885-882; 125-640-811-575-675; 145-173-591-605-70X; 145-901-489-655-260; 153-006-057-028-377; 187-301-166-275-583; 195-681-144-057-136,6,True,cc-by,gold,lens

037-328-101-649-901,Understanding the fundamental dynamics of interbank networks,2017-03-01,2017.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Teruyoshi Kobayashi; Taro Takaguchi,"The global financial crisis in 2007-2009 demonstrated that systemic risk can spread all over the world through a complex web of financial linkages. In particular, interbank credit networks shape the core of the financial system, in which interconnected risk emerges from a massive number of temporal transactions between banks. However, the lack of fundamental knowledge about the dynamic nature of interbank networks makes it difficult to evaluate and control systemic risk. Here, we analyze the dynamics of real interbank networks at a daily temporal resolution. While daily networks have been flexibly changing their structure from day to day, entailing entries and exits of banks, we discover explicit dynamical patterns that have been surprisingly stable over time even amid the global financial crisis. The emergence of these dynamical patterns is accurately reproduced by a model, in which banks' demand for trading follows a random walk. The discovery of fundamental patterns in the daily evolution of interbank networks will enhance our ability to evaluate systemic risk and could contribute to the dynamic management of financial stability.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Dynamics (music); Structure (mathematical logic); Core (game theory); Control (management); Financial crisis; Dynamic management; Financial stability; Monetary economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/koe/wpaper/1711.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:koe:wpaper:1711,https://ideas.repec.org/p/koe/wpaper/1711.html,,,3121820955,,0,,0,False,,,lens
083-263-175-319-407,Circuit Theory of Finance and the Role of Incentives in Financial Sector Reform - Circuit theory of finance and the role of incentives in financial sector reform,,1998.0,journal article,Policy Research Working Papers,18139450,The World Bank,,Biagio Bossone,"The author analyzes the financial system's role in economic growth and stability, addressing several core policy issues associated with financial sector reform in emerging economies. He studies finance's role in the context of a circuit model, with interacting rational, forward-looking, heterogeneous agents. He shows finance to essentially complement the price system in coordinating decentralized intertemporal resource allocation choices made by agents operating with limited information and incomplete trust. He discusses the links between finance and incentives for efficiency and stability in the context of the circuit model. He also identifies incentives and incentive-compatible institutions for reform strategies for financial sectors in emerging economies. Among his conclusions: 1) Circuit theory features important methodological advantages to analyze the role of finance, and to assess structural weaknesses of financial systems under different institutional settings and in different stages of economic development. 2) Incentives for prudence and honesty can protect the stability of the circuit by directing private sector forces unleashed by liberalization. In particular: a) Financial institutions should be encouraged to invest in reputational capital. b) Governments should complement the creation of franchise value by strengthening supervision and by adopting a regulatory regime based on rules designed to align the private incentives of market players with the social goal of financial stability. c) Safety nets to reduce systemic risk should minimize the moral hazard from stakeholders by limiting risk protection and by making the cost of protection sensitive to the risk taken. d) Governments should encourage self-policing in the financial sector. e) Where information and trust are scarce, there is a potential market for them, and governments can greatly improve incentives for optimal provision of information. f) Governments should strengthen the complementarity between the formal and the informal financial sectors. Emphasizing incentives is not to deny the importance of good rules, capable regulators and supervisors, and strong enforcement measures. It is to suggest that the returns on investments to set up rules, institutions, and enforcement mechanisms can be greater if market players have an incentive to align their own objectives with the social goal of financial stability.",,,1,,Finance; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Indirect finance; Financial sector development; Incentive; Geography of finance; Financial intermediary; Financial risk,,,,,http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/pt/828421468766469349/Circuit-theory-of-finance-and-the-role-of-incentives-in-financial-sector-reform https://ssrn.com/abstract=597223 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=597223 https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/1813-9450-2026,http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-2026,,10.1596/1813-9450-2026,2108146991,,0,003-558-154-673-550; 006-789-783-972-024; 007-476-658-028-762; 007-939-690-189-695; 008-934-189-860-266; 010-960-050-942-823; 026-081-682-577-166; 027-271-073-874-150; 040-806-046-774-911; 051-223-450-457-613; 072-399-192-308-770; 075-401-188-052-732; 078-540-552-159-202; 089-940-430-530-626; 090-197-009-451-948; 119-467-021-577-138; 121-394-722-855-679; 134-513-513-338-561; 136-829-927-859-029; 139-768-751-635-509; 182-726-716-644-85X; 193-192-837-246-247,5,True,,green,lens

Issues discussed in this study involve: (i) financial linkages and systemic risk assessment; (ii) procyclicality of the financial system; (iii) appropriate regulatory arrangement, bank governance and executive compensation. Regarding the systemic risk issue, we found evidence of negative externalities imposed onto the banking system value-at-risk (VaR) by banks and other types of financial institutions such as finance, securities and insurance companies. Therefore, bank regulators needs to be aware of the additional risk imposed onto the system during distress time and take this into account when assessing the risk level of banks. Next, the results from panel data regressions suggested that the level of procyclicality decreased from the pre-Asian Crisis period when compared to the post-crisis period. Moreover, the nature of cyclicality differed by asset classes. Therefore, we proposed that, if their goal was to mitigate excessive cyclicality, supervisors must also take into account types of loans as well. Finally, the paper outlines the importance of implementing regulatory statues that will minimize regulatory arbitrage as well as promoting cautious financial innovations and bank governance, which were identified as a few of the fundamental causes leading to the onset of the U.S. financial crisis.",,,,,Finance; Structured finance; Financial analysis; Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Financial risk management; Financial regulation; Financial system; Financial risk; Financial ratio,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bth/wpaper/2009-04.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bth/wpaper/2009-04.html,,,1591372921,,0,003-348-741-765-69X; 030-578-154-188-157; 045-002-506-144-629; 046-169-328-895-892; 051-749-937-973-931; 052-530-791-207-934; 055-353-697-261-007; 074-849-208-298-983; 076-534-845-676-322; 080-805-342-346-694; 088-404-242-589-57X; 088-993-997-046-627; 091-191-160-809-497; 095-074-086-510-843; 113-243-594-068-188; 118-405-601-922-735; 136-247-986-607-382; 150-347-168-528-987; 181-346-274-461-667; 182-401-964-998-619,1,False,,,lens

However, CCPs are also highly interconnected with financial institutions and markets and therefore too important to fail. The increased volumes cleared through CCPs and their increasing global scope, in particular in the OTC derivatives market, make it even more important that systemic risks related to CCPs are managed. This paper argues that the current set of international policy measures does partly address these risks, but that alternative policy measures are needed to reduce remaining systemic risks. For example, the paper recommends network analysis to be conducted by CCPs and authorities to gauge potential losses and suggests a common international approach to central bank services to help reduce the dependency of CCPs on services provided by commercial banks.",,,,,Finance; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Financial market; Collateral; Capital requirement; Risk management; Derivatives market,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/wp1521.pdf?abstractid=2568596&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2568596 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/wp1521.pdf?abstractid=2568596&mirid=1&type=2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2568596,,,2071147125,,0,001-128-310-074-195,3,False,,,lens

Since the problem of Global Warming, became imminent, researches of all kind are striving to find new, more environment friendly solutions to meet their energy demands. Due to technology limitations, and systemic risks, renewable resources still are exploited poorly and most of the generation depends on fossils. A growing body of literature proves that shortage of energy supply affects directly economic growth, so we face this challenge: “How to produce cleaner energy with maximum reliability?” Albania generates electricity 100% from hydro resources. Even though there have been a lot of new investments in power generating sector, we believe that we are still exposed to an excessive amount of risk because of lack of diversification. So, this paper addresses issues on planning electric generation supply to achieve maximum reliability for Albania, by analyzing present generation risk from hydro resources and considering diversification effect on Albania’s electricity generating portfolio. We begin by analyzing to day work that support portfolio planning in power sector. Then we address the Modern Portfolio Theory and analyze how it proposes solutions to an optimization problem. After that we take a brief overview of the power sector current situation and its dependence on import. By using a small simulation we will try to demonstrate that adding new generating technologies can reduce risk and improve power generation.",11,10,,,Environmental economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Marketing; Work (electrical); Diversification (finance); Electricity; Energy supply; Portfolio; Electricity generation; Modern portfolio theory,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/79589521/applying-modern-portfolio-theory-to-plant-electricity-planning-in-albania https://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/view/5423 https://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/download/5423/5319 https://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/5423/5319,https://paperity.org/p/79589521/applying-modern-portfolio-theory-to-plant-electricity-planning-in-albania,,,1486739139,,0,007-423-541-975-476; 059-717-975-501-745; 062-698-668-788-384,3,False,,,lens

To understand the relationship between business cycles and cascades of bankruptcies, we model a three-sector economy with goods, credit and interbank market. In the interbank market, the participating banks share the risk of bad debits, which may potentially spread a bank’s liquidity problems through the network of banks. Our agent-based model sheds light on the correlation between bankruptcy cascades and the endogenous economic cycle of booms and recessions. It also demonstrates the serious trade-off between, on the one hand, reducing risks of individual banks by sharing them and, on the other hand, creating systemic risks through credit-related interlinkages of banks.

Chatzizisis; Ahmet U. Coskun; Michael Jonas; Elazer R. Edelman; Charles L. Feldman; Peter Stone,"Although the entire coronary tree is exposed to the atherogenic effect of the systemic risk factors, atherosclerotic lesions form at specific arterial regions, where low and oscillatory endothelial shear stress (ESS) occur. Low ESS modulates endothelial gene expression through complex mechanoreception and mechanotransduction processes, inducing an atherogenic endothelial phenotype and formation of an early atherosclerotic plaque. Each early plaque exhibits an individual natural history of progression, regression, or stabilization, which is dependent not only on the formation and progression of atherosclerosis but also on the vascular remodeling response. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the remodeling of the atherosclerotic wall are incompletely understood, the dynamic interplay between local hemodynamic milieu, low ESS in particular, and the biology of the wall is likely to be important. In this review, we explore the molecular, cellular, and vascular processes supporting the role of low ESS in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling and indicate likely mechanisms concerning the different natural history trajectories of individual coronary lesions. Atherosclerotic plaques associated with excessive expansive remodeling evolve to high-risk plaques, because low ESS conditions persist, thereby promoting continued local lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, matrix breakdown, and eventually further plaque progression and excessive expansive remodeling. An enhanced understanding of the pathobiologic processes responsible for atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling might allow for early identification of a high-risk coronary plaque and thereby provide a rationale for innovative diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for the management of coronary patients and prevention of acute coronary syndromes.",49,25,2379,2393,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Pathology; Regeneration (biology); Mechanotransduction; Inflammation; Endothelium; Vascular disease; Pathogenesis; Coronary atherosclerosis; Medicine; Circulatory system,,"Blood Flow Velocity; Coronary Artery Disease/diagnostic imaging; Coronary Circulation/physiology; Coronary Vessels/physiology; Disease Progression; Endothelium, Vascular/physiopathology; Female; Humans; Male; Mechanoreceptors/physiology; Nitric Oxide/metabolism; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/genetics; Oxidative Stress; Regeneration; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stress, Mechanical; Ultrasonography, Interventional; Vascular Resistance/physiology","Nitric Oxide; NOS3 protein, human; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073510970701220X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17599600 https://www.jacc.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.059 https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/49/25/2379.abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S073510970701220X http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17599600/ https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/accj/49/25/2379.full.pdf https://experts.nebraska.edu/en/publications/role-of-endothelial-shear-stress-in-the-natural-history-of-corona https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yiannis_Chatzizisis/publication/6237199_Role_of_Endothelial_Shear_Stress_in_the_Natural_History_of_Coronary_Atherosclerosis_and_Vascular_Remodeling._Molecular_Cellular_and_Vascular_Behavior/links/541667ac0cf2bb7347db49f8.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17599600 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17599600/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.059,17599600,10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.059,196835504,,7,000-554-945-456-950; 000-784-201-270-655; 001-302-011-575-214; 002-081-970-417-609; 002-626-642-608-50X; 003-397-290-232-798; 003-596-509-994-458; 005-056-739-090-812; 006-263-205-817-691; 006-878-423-352-870; 006-941-920-033-896; 007-747-177-474-376; 009-217-145-612-484; 009-351-731-162-292; 010-605-111-710-406; 013-530-366-288-783; 014-473-779-177-334; 014-568-760-068-754; 015-511-248-277-548; 015-801-161-440-686; 015-974-133-576-266; 016-443-432-324-417; 017-339-528-615-928; 017-960-673-814-144; 018-167-501-273-356; 018-748-266-627-593; 018-943-816-802-231; 019-719-237-535-554; 020-391-423-394-563; 021-840-269-129-266; 022-057-169-197-204; 022-268-590-578-035; 022-383-399-159-477; 024-144-907-769-39X; 024-560-445-876-520; 025-203-682-831-853; 026-763-721-601-068; 027-834-483-830-499; 028-338-494-105-923; 028-551-267-800-865; 029-322-794-608-792; 029-355-685-406-99X; 030-244-352-414-282; 030-520-122-432-870; 030-634-902-569-099; 030-738-969-480-319; 031-052-212-427-129; 031-549-287-155-651; 032-267-029-852-48X; 032-460-197-214-73X; 033-561-477-033-684; 035-455-013-435-179; 036-307-315-272-055; 036-476-059-731-060; 036-685-425-931-283; 039-817-928-432-663; 040-314-958-999-813; 041-203-461-605-748; 041-459-905-230-588; 042-618-228-053-618; 042-874-273-808-568; 044-500-008-404-729; 044-579-416-051-285; 048-370-837-831-341; 048-419-221-451-302; 049-472-602-956-581; 050-592-189-630-896; 051-163-887-050-128; 053-047-366-422-330; 053-769-115-972-949; 054-422-230-490-914; 054-522-196-423-889; 054-780-102-042-754; 054-808-641-598-26X; 055-180-871-165-844; 055-982-623-061-805; 059-844-689-398-283; 060-672-712-283-183; 061-325-930-273-768; 062-390-911-170-787; 062-433-964-475-522; 063-204-981-733-690; 063-405-768-028-870; 063-929-330-582-33X; 064-019-835-122-711; 064-696-260-002-927; 065-264-821-944-12X; 066-275-019-967-498; 066-939-374-018-747; 069-483-477-828-36X; 069-818-017-263-048; 071-049-861-484-506; 071-947-335-134-383; 072-170-110-247-754; 072-232-355-001-622; 072-393-087-423-921; 072-847-271-666-61X; 073-219-248-218-973; 073-727-282-852-178; 073-750-551-082-18X; 074-882-671-349-265; 075-390-296-362-649; 077-567-240-959-394; 080-613-177-742-637; 080-934-684-211-459; 081-028-424-273-639; 087-799-915-864-998; 088-512-052-851-66X; 088-955-570-080-968; 090-342-740-776-299; 090-994-559-387-962; 091-367-879-786-050; 094-087-909-497-480; 095-875-570-572-173; 097-487-010-001-514; 097-972-102-010-986; 098-052-987-172-361; 098-222-984-369-723; 099-580-568-359-389; 107-179-829-888-519; 107-651-549-018-46X; 109-885-235-306-826; 119-424-089-382-361; 121-544-490-495-213; 122-476-671-801-843; 124-871-101-020-984; 126-806-695-049-734; 135-129-157-630-004; 150-538-893-927-624; 162-077-607-075-798; 166-518-941-456-111; 168-186-553-896-021; 174-106-134-025-437; 184-510-853-229-388,1223,True,elsevier-specific: oa user license,,lens

In this informal analysis and design proposal, we describe how infrastructure for digital assets can serve as a useful monetary and fiscal policy tool and an enabler of existing tools in the future, particularly during crises, while aligning the trajectory of financial technology innovation toward a brighter future. We propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both internet purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. We also propose an approach to digital currency that would allow for more efficient and transparent clearing and settlement, implementation of monetary and fiscal policy, and management of systemic risk. The digital currency could be implemented as central bank digital currency (CBDC), or it could be issued by the government and collateralised by public funds or Treasury assets. Our proposed architecture allows both manifestations and would be operated by banks and other money services businesses, operating within a framework overseen by government regulators. We argue that now is the time for action to undertake development of such a system, not only because of the current crisis but also in anticipation of future crises resulting from geopolitical risks, the continued globalisation of the digital economy, and the changing value and risks that technology brings.",,,,,Digital currency; Treasury; Currency; Business; Monetary policy; Globalization; Economics; Financial system; Finance; Monetary economics; Market economy; Archaeology; History,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2006.03023,,10.48550/arxiv.2006.03023,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

Physical climate risks can disrupt port operations, which, apart from infrastructure damages (i.e. direct impacts), can have domestic and cross-border economic losses through transport dependencies on ports (i.e. systemic impacts). For instance, Hurricane Katrina (2005) disrupted operations in multiple ports in New Orleans, resulting in more than USD800 million export losses and price spikes of food products, affecting supply-chains globally (Trepte and Rice, 2014). Both climate change and changes in global trade flows (in absolute terms and trade patterns) can increase systemic risks to ports and economies in the future. In order to improve the resilience of the transport and supply-chain networks, present-day and future climate-induced systemic risks to ports need to be quantified on a global scale.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here we present a global analysis of present-day and future systemic risk to ports due to physical climate impacts (cyclones, fluvial flooding, coastal flooding, pluvial flooding). To do this, we combine multi-hazard risk estimates of global port infrastructure (Verschuur et al. 2021, under review), covering ~1400 ports, with the output of a newly developed global maritime freight model that quantifies the dependencies of sectors and nations on ports. We show how climate-induced port disruptions can initiate economic ripple effects across geographies, although the vulnerability to these impacts differ across countries and sectors. Moreover, we project how systemic risk would increase by 2050 under various climate and trade scenarios, supporting the business case for adaptation. &amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These results can help inform resilience strategies at the port-level (e.g. port elevation) , as well as the supply-chain level (e.g. diversification of transport and import). Moreover, it can support national port infrastructure planning to reduce the systemic risk. &amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>",,,,,Supply chain; Port (circuit theory); Business; Vulnerability (computing); Climate change; Pluvial; Flooding (psychology); Systemic risk; Natural resource economics; Environmental science; Economics; Engineering; Computer science; Financial crisis; Psychology; Ecology; Oceanography; Computer security; Macroeconomics; Marketing; Geology; Electrical engineering; Psychotherapist; Biology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1427,,10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1427,,,0,,0,False,,,lens
030-903-321-285-971,Global Index on Financial Losses due to Crime in the United States,2021-05-07,2021.0,,arXiv: Risk Management,,,,Thilini Mahanama; Abootaleb Shirvani; Svetlozar T. Rachev,"Crime can have a volatile impact on investments. Despite the potential importance of crime rates in investments, there are no indices dedicated to evaluating the financial impact of crime in the United States. As such, this paper presents an index-based insurance portfolio for crime in the United States by utilizing the financial losses reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for property crimes and cybercrimes. Our research intends to help investors envision risk exposure in our portfolio, gauge investment risk based on their desired risk level, and hedge strategies for potential losses due to economic crashes. Underlying the index, we hedge the investments by issuing marketable European call and put options and providing risk budgets (diversifying risk to each type of crime).

Bank regulation is strikingly not neutral in this aspect, it explicitly favors short-duration adjustable-rate loans over long-duration fixed-rate loans in the framework of the gap management. This asymmetry in the regulation creates perverse incentives both for banks and households, which can lead to aggressive risk-taking, over-indebtedness of unhedged households, high procyclicality of mortgage markets, and increased systemic risks. We present a stress test model to quantify potential losses stemming from this specific risk from the perspective of lender institutions. We estimate the average extra capital that is needed to cover the additional risk of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the EU to be 0.53% of the value of the total mortgage portfolio and 1.97% of the value of the adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio. We propose introducing a stress test model as a new mandatory element into banks' risk management framework.",17,3,e0263599,e0263599,Portfolio; Stress test; Interest rate; Monetary economics; Mortgage underwriting; Systemic risk; Default risk; Interest rate risk; Business; Economics; Credit risk; Risk management; Actuarial science; Financial economics; Financial system; Financial crisis; Mortgage insurance; Finance; Insurance policy; Macroeconomics; Casualty insurance,,Family Characteristics; Housing,,"National Office for Research, Development, and Innovation; National Office for Research, Development, and Innovation; National Research, Development and Innovation Office - NKFIH; National Research, Development and Innovation Office - NKFIH",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263599,35312687,10.1371/journal.pone.0263599,,PMC9048703,0,010-590-580-205-606; 013-036-738-409-299; 013-793-831-953-852; 017-651-240-426-323; 019-738-927-274-56X; 024-087-019-948-05X; 035-562-657-430-625; 046-893-937-311-60X; 053-048-091-929-443; 061-913-109-871-539; 066-216-604-291-695; 066-613-118-516-421; 068-927-655-874-528; 075-599-572-858-18X; 081-839-449-635-64X; 084-120-576-759-188; 089-712-913-358-002; 093-478-739-048-202; 095-260-778-590-185; 098-759-455-202-573; 116-103-785-428-873; 122-505-735-084-565; 129-356-416-159-847; 151-704-531-850-313; 152-236-961-214-255; 157-767-041-822-471; 192-786-642-332-681,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

The evolution of log-monetary reserves of $N$ banks is described by coupled diffusions driven by controls with delay in their drifts. Banks are minimizing their finite-horizon objective functions which take into account a quadratic cost for lending or borrowing and a linear incentive to borrow if the reserve is low or lend if the reserve is high relative to the average capitalization of the system. As such, our problem is an $N$-player linear-quadratic stochastic differential game with delay. An open-loop Nash equilibrium is obtained using a system of fully coupled forward and advanced backward stochastic differential equations. We then describe how the delay affects liquidity and systemic risk characterized by a large number of defaults.

This period of low macroeconomic uctuations, also called the Great Moderation, is often attributed to a successful policy of stabilization, including improvements in the conduct of monetary policy. This paper argues, using a standard banking model with inecient borrowing, that such stabilization policies during moderate times can increase the magnitude of a nancial crisis due to higher optimal risk exposure by nancial intermediaries. Taking into account amplication eects during a crisis, a stabilization policy may also result in higher aggregate volatility of output and lower aggregate welfare.

We compute the index for 10 European countries, exploiting the information incorporated in the CDS premia of 44 large banks over the period January 2007 – September 2010. In this way, we provide a market based measure of the liability incurred by the Governments, due to the implicit bail-out guarantees they provide to the financial sector. We find that during the financial crisis the systemic component of the default risk in the banking sector has significantly increased in all countries, with the exception of Germany and the Netherlands. As a consequence, the Governments’ liability implicit in the bail out guarantee amounts to a quite relevant share of GDP in several countries: it is huge for Ireland, lower but still important for the other PIIGS (Italy is the least affected within this group) and for the UK. Finally, our estimate is very close to the overall amount of money already committed in the rescue plans adopted in Europe between Octo ber 2008 and March 2010, despite strong cross-country differences: in particular, Germany and Ireland seem to have committed an amount of resources much larger than needed; to the contrary, the Italian Government has committed much less than it should.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Government; Liability; Financial crisis; Government budget; Index (economics); Distribution (economics); Homogeneous; Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ctc:serie3:ief0103,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ctc:serie3:ief0103,,,3126044101,,0,,2,False,,,lens

However, next to its many advantages, the joint currency and single monetary policy increased the probability of property bubbles in the EU low income countries. The excessive speculations, which resulted in the burst of the US property bubble, the financial crisis, as well as the fiscal problems and the recession in Europe in 2010, uncovered the weaknesses of the financial integration and the inability of the European financial system to absorb large shocks. The financial losses, and the risk that some banks and moreover, even some euro zone member countries might become insolvent, underlined the existence of large systemic risks. As a result, cross border lending declined, the European credit market was affected negatively and the uncertainty concerning the stability of the euro increased. The second phase of the crisis in Europe was a starting point to develop some new international solutions to those problems aimed at increasing the stability of the European financial system. Our paper presents an overview of the literature on the advancement of financial integration in the euro zone, as well as in other regions including Poland.

093-621-578-795-037,Supervision of Banking Networks Using the Multivariate Threshold-Minimum Dominating Set (mT-MDS),2022-06-06,2022.0,journal article,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,19118074; 19118066,MDPI AG,,Periklis Gogas; Theophilos Papadimitriou; Maria-Artemis Matthaiou,"<jats:p>The global financial crisis of 2008, triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, highlighted a banking system that was widely exposed to systemic risk. The minimization of the systemic risk via a close and detailed monitoring of the entire banking network became a priority. This is a complex and demanding task considering the size of the banking systems; in the US and the EU they include more than 10,000 institutions. In this paper, we introduce a methodology which identifies a subset of banks that can: (a) efficiently represent the behavior of the whole banking system, and (b), provide, in the case of a failure, a plausible range of the crisis dispersion. The proposed methodology can be used by the regulators as an auxiliary monitoring tool to identify groups of banks that are potentially in distress and try to swiftly remedy their problems and minimize the propagation of the crisis by restricting contagion. This methodology is based on graph theory, and more specifically, complex networks. We termed this setting a “multivariate Threshold–Minimum Dominating Set” (mT-MDS), and it is an extension of the Threshold–Minimum Dominating Set methodology. The method was tested on a dataset of 570 U.S. banks, including 429 solvent ones and 141 failed ones. The variables used to create the networks were as follows: the total interest expense; the total interest income; the tier 1 (core) risk-based capital; and the total assets. The empirical results reveal that the proposed methodology can be successfully employed as an auxiliary tool for the efficient supervision of a large banking network.</jats:p>",15,6,253,253,Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Multivariate statistics; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Range (aeronautics); Multivariate normal distribution; Minimum capital; Minification; Business; Capital adequacy ratio; Economics; Econometrics; Engineering; Incentive; Microeconomics; Machine learning; Macroeconomics; Programming language; Aerospace engineering,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jrfm15060253,,10.3390/jrfm15060253,,,0,000-796-436-932-682; 007-215-413-735-324; 014-622-546-804-612; 015-330-084-659-28X; 016-556-778-208-713; 021-663-749-315-338; 021-663-931-535-732; 027-049-803-718-428; 028-097-496-112-874; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-582-421-227-58X; 036-615-479-671-743; 038-127-620-589-387; 038-773-261-874-86X; 042-252-558-354-17X; 049-661-520-876-521; 053-218-295-144-866; 053-450-861-314-097; 058-879-947-933-394; 061-642-316-115-574; 068-986-037-255-244; 074-499-124-873-904; 075-897-862-903-52X; 078-894-821-491-595; 088-164-972-758-558; 090-328-172-692-220; 091-384-088-522-133; 124-373-760-730-021; 124-699-285-377-635; 132-801-581-730-809; 140-760-989-008-723; 148-121-842-477-103; 149-557-070-363-758,1,True,cc-by,gold,lens

However, innovations are in general new tools materializing around existing strategies in order to make them more widely available and measurable. Their pace of evolution parallels the complexity of the interconnectedness between institutions as well as the development of technologies facilitating a number of transactions never before imagined. However, complexity brings with it opacity, and it is crucial today to implement synthetic and comprehensive measures of the global exposure of an institution and of the contagion risk present in the system. This requires a much clearer definition of expectations and responsibilities as well as a form of governance based on the dynamics of flow regardless of the instruments and strategies in question. Otherwise, important questions such as exposure to liquidity risk will remain too vast and too abstract.",,1,11,22,Risk analysis (engineering); Systemic risk; Political science; Order (exchange); Liquidity risk; Parallels; Pace; Context (language use); Corporate governance; Management science; Interconnectedness,,,,,,,,,2727490952,,0,,0,False,,,lens

To this end, we develop an environment where banks offer insurance to their depositors against both idiosyncratic and aggregate real uncertainty, by holding a portfolio of liquidity and productive illiquid assets. Moreover, banks’ asset portfolios and the probability of a depositors’ self-fulfilling run are jointly determined via a “global game”. In equilibrium, an endogenous pecking order emerges: if the recovery rate associated with early liquidation of the productive assets is sufficiently low and the depositors are sufficiently risk averse, the banks first employ liquidity and then liquidate the productive asset, in order to finance depositors’ withdrawals. Ex ante, the banks hold more liquidity than in a full-information economy, where there are no self-fulfilling runs and risk is only due to idiosyncratic and aggregate real uncertainty.",,,,,Global game; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Asset (economics); Portfolio; Monetary economics; Bank run,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2980873,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2980873,,10.2139/ssrn.2980873,3168635524,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

Leduc; Stefan Thurner,"When banks extend loans to each other, they generate a negative externality in the form of systemic risk. They create a network of interbank exposures by which they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper, we show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to devise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that captures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different impact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax a Systemic Risk Tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the matching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique equilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient, i.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume. On the other hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings exist, which are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively stimulate a `rewiring' of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it more resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume. Moreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like tax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it taxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to have a limited effect on reducing systemic risk while it decreases transaction volume.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Externality; Microeconomics; Financial networks; Interbank network; Financial transaction tax; Insolvency; Centrality; Database transaction,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1606.03595.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1606.03595,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1606.03595.html,,,3123229558,,0,,2,False,,,lens

This is because ‘shadow banking’ is often used as a catch-all term to refer to financial activities and transactions that may not be subject to traditional realms of regulation, but the amorphous nature of the term is unsatisfactory for informing debates on regulatory perimeter and policy. Often, a ‘functional’ approach is suggested in order to understand the nature of financial activities and transactions that are lumped into the ‘shadow banking’ category. The ‘functional’ approach focuses on the economic function of the financial activity in question, regardless of the type of institution carrying it out. By looking at the economic function performed by the financial activity in question, one may better be able to ascertain the underlying demand and supply for such function and the risks that such functions give rise to, particularly whether systemic risk is implicated. The approach may also highlight the functional similarities and differences with already-regulated financial activity in order to form views as to the regulatory perimeter for shadow banking activities. The ‘functional’ approach to shadow banking is therefore a prima facie useful approach to surveying the universe of shadow banking and informing the policy-making process in relation to shadow banking activities and transactions at national and international levels.This article however raises queries as to the limitations of the ‘functional’ approach, and whether such limitations would ultimately hamper the development of regulatory policy. In particular, we question whether the functional approach is too embedded in market-liberal assumptions, and gives rise to a ‘like-for-like’ presumption in favour of the design of regulatory methodology. Further, we query whether the functional approach, though conceptually promising, is subject to the legal arbitrage that it seeks to overcome. Nevertheless, this article does not deny the achievements made by adopting the ‘functional’ approach and suggests how it should be put to optimal use.The article begins by briefly sketching why commentators and policy-makers have endorsed a ‘functional’ approach to understanding shadow banking. It then proceeds to examine the nature and origins of the functional approach in financial regulation more generally. We assess the achievements of the functional approach in understanding and mapping shadow banking, followed by exploring the limitations we perceive. We suggest that the optimal application of the functional approach must be stakeholder-inclusive and focused primarily on global surveillance. Such an approach is therefore not frontloaded with implications for policy-making, leaving policy choices to be debated in open and inclusive dialogue, so that the relevant international and national authorities may determine their policy choices. We argue that such an approach is optimal as it is likely to produce more objective factual findings that are unpartisan in nature and accessible to many. We argue that such an approach may be regarded as part of an endeavour towards a near-Habermasian dialogue between economy and society. Such a dialogue is desirable, and may be an important piece in the wider context of the political economy of financial regulation.",,,,,Supply and demand; Economy; Systemic risk; Prima facie; Arbitrage; Economics; Market fragmentation; Functional approach; Presumption; Financial regulation,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2735000,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2735000,,,2300865920,,0,,0,False,,,lens

This has included the use of regulatory sandboxes, favourable tax treatment, and some limited financial support for start-up firms, alongside wider pro-competition policies in banking and payments. This chapter provides an economic analysis of these policies, arguing that they can lack coherence. Policies should focus on the broader and more significant challenge of digital transformation—using digital technology to address market and organisational failures across financial services—and addressing the governance challenges that restrict this digital transformation of finance. This requires measures, such as open banking, to eliminate barriers to competition. It further requires substantial regulatory engagement and dialogue with the industry on the development of the information and data infrastructures that will allow them to properly support customer needs, control prudential and systemic risk, and meet other key regulatory objectives.

Wolff,"• At the extraordinary European Council of 21 July European leaders should first pave the way to restoring solvency in Greece by initiating debt reduction. This implies: i) reducing the interest rate on official lending, ii) requesting from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) support for an immediate bond buy-back programme, and iii) asking the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) for an immediate evaluation of the risks to financial stability involved in a future restructuring of sovereign debt in the euro area. • Second, immediate growth-enhancing measures should be financed through unused European Union Structural Funds and European Investment Bank loans (€16 billion), which should be used to: i) raise the quality of higher education, ii) finance wage subsidies in manufacturing and tourism to generate an internal devaluation while containing domestic-demand costs; and iii) create research laboratories to underpin an upgrading of Greece’s value chain. • Third, risks to financial stability in the euro area should be addressed by breaking the vicious circle of sovereign debt and banking risk. The EFSF should be able to guarantee national deposit insurance schemes; at the same time, the European Banking Authority should assume stronger supervisory powers. • This is an immediate action plan.

The challenging task of identifying, modeling, and analyzing the causes and effects of such feedback loops requires a proper systems engineering perspective lacking in the remedies proposed in recent literature. We propose that signed directed graphs (SDG), a modeling methodology extensively used in process systems engineering, is a useful framework to address this challenge. The SDG framework is able to represent and reveal information missed by more traditional network models of financial system. This framework adds crucial information to a network model about the direction of influence and control between nodes, providing a tool for analyzing the potential hazards and instabilities in the system. This paper also discusses how the SDG framework can facilitate the automation of the identification and monitoring of potential vulnerabilities, illustrated with an example of a bank/dealer case study.",,,,,Network model; Risk analysis (engineering); Automation; Systemic risk; Work in process; Control (management); Financial networks; Task (project management); Computer science; Identification (information),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ofr:wpaper:15-01 https://ideas.repec.org/p/ofr/wpaper/15-01.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ofr:wpaper:15-01,,,3124663406,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Systemic risk in the financial system arises to a large extent as a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange, and securities. The interplay of the various exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007 to 2013. We show that focusing on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90%. By assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected systemic losses are up to a factor of four higher now than before the financial crisis of 2007–2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of one thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates the total risk. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels.",20,,70,81,Finance; Risk assessment; Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Financial crisis; Financial risk management; Financial regulation; Risk factor (computing); Financial risk,,,,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11393/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572308915000856 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:eee:finsta:v:20:y:2015:i:c:p:70-81 https://core.ac.uk/display/85833672 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F579ee8cb-82db-451f-b272-1064a706c85a https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Serafin_Martinez-Jaramillo/publication/276923341_The_multi-layer_network_nature_of_systemic_risk_and_its_implications_for_the_costs_of_financial_crises/links/5591754008ae47a34910a6fa.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeefinsta/v_3a20_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a70-81.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/finsta/v20y2015icp70-81.html https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150504276P/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/33971636.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfs.2015.08.001,,10.1016/j.jfs.2015.08.001,348488691,,0,001-274-723-652-948; 001-619-997-217-899; 008-197-257-997-110; 015-330-084-659-28X; 017-507-126-953-22X; 019-687-296-589-620; 020-586-688-906-501; 020-699-158-967-631; 022-404-239-527-189; 023-264-592-074-082; 025-094-460-907-584; 025-303-272-106-219; 026-217-938-515-250; 030-582-421-227-58X; 033-555-944-909-438; 034-618-882-762-654; 034-967-004-796-717; 035-104-934-704-682; 035-821-379-237-107; 036-931-922-556-569; 039-876-604-039-240; 047-556-082-206-132; 052-619-799-818-546; 057-229-969-248-039; 057-320-712-894-93X; 057-816-578-318-497; 062-547-592-425-211; 064-120-679-762-739; 066-726-956-150-060; 066-740-154-957-592; 069-420-783-846-939; 077-436-811-650-375; 077-525-074-871-112; 080-429-212-781-296; 083-508-652-775-775; 083-781-202-643-801; 088-149-451-347-256; 090-328-172-692-220; 101-731-103-558-535; 101-937-167-520-388; 102-504-579-206-224; 105-395-385-823-338; 110-637-199-001-314; 121-474-354-271-951; 123-699-515-895-205; 124-132-600-843-548; 125-011-400-279-052; 127-548-643-861-269; 142-631-391-157-152; 151-026-253-897-292; 161-381-189-526-903; 165-328-461-905-383; 183-376-861-980-736; 192-182-712-951-086,191,True,,green,lens

The first part deals with systemic risk in the banking sector. First, it asks whether countercyclical macroprudential policy tools can be an effective way of reducing cyclicality in bank lending. The main finding is that these policies can be counterproductive and may incentivize more intertwined banks, and hence, endanger financial stability. The next paper investigates, and provides some evidence of, the possibility that banks actively change their portfolios in order to influence the likelihood of joint bank failure. The second part of this dissertation studies the connection between public finance and financial stability. Chapter 4 looks into the interaction between bank capital regulation and taxation and finds that banks trade off leverage risk against portfolio risk in response to a higher corporate income tax rates. Finally, Chapter 5 analyses banks’ excessive holdings of domestic government debt as one of the sources of the interrelatedness of public finance and bank stability. Two possible explanations of banks’ home bias are tested: voluntary government bond hoarding and government induced bond buying.",,,,,Finance; Public policy; Systemic risk; Economics; Public finance; Bank failure; Government debt; Government bond; Monetary economics; Bond; Leverage (finance),,,,,https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/essays-in-financial-stability-and-public-policy https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atilburguniversity.edu%3Apublications%2F9e6a078e-4278-4438-8d2c-cb151438e582 https://ideas.repec.org/p/tiu/tiutis/9e6a078e-4278-4438-8d2c-cb151438e582.html https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/8610161/Balint_Horvath_phd_thesis_mod.pdf,https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/essays-in-financial-stability-and-public-policy,,,2260897673,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The proposed contagion mechanism provides an endogenous rule for early defaults in a network of financial institutions. The main result is to demonstrate a mean field interaction that can be found as the limit of the finite bank system generated from a finite Eisenberg-Noe style network. In this way, we connect two previously disparate frameworks for systemic risk, and in turn we provide a bridge for exploiting recent advances in mean field analysis when modelling systemic risk.

Surgical techniques currently used for treating bone defects may count on different alternatives, including autologous vascularized bone grafts, homologous bone graft provided by musculoskeletal tissue bank, heterologous bone graft (xenograft), or prostheses, each one of them dealing with both specific advantages and complications and drawbacks. The main concerns related to these techniques respectively are: donor site morbidity and limited available amount; possible immune response and viral transmission; possible animal-derived pathogen transmission and risk of immunogenic rejection; high invasiveness and surgery-related systemic risks, long post-operative. physical recovery and prostheses revision need. Nowadays, an ideal alternative is the use of osteoconductive synthetic bone substitutes. Many synthetic substitutes are available, used either alone or in combination with other bone graft. Synthetic bone graft materials available as alternatives to autogeneous bone include calcium sulphates, special glass ceramics (bioactive glasses) and calcium phosphates (calcium hydroxyapatite, HA; tricalcium phosphate, TCP; and biphasic calcium phosphate, BCP). These materials differ in composition and physical properties fro each other and from bone (De Groot in Bioceramics of calcium phosphate, pp 100-114, 1983; Hench in J Am Ceram Soc 74:1487-1510, 1994; Jarcho in Clin Orthop 157:259-278, 1981; Daculsi et al. in Int Rev Cytol 172:129-191, 1996). Both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric HA-based substitutes represent the current first choice in orthopedic surgery, in that they provide an osteoconductive scaffold to which chemotactic, circulating proteins and cells (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, osteoinductive growth factors) can migrate and adhere, and within which progenitor cells can differentiate into functioning osteoblasts (Szpalski and Gunzburg in Orthopedics 25S:601-609, 2002). Indeed, HA may be extemporarily combined either with whole autologous bone marrow or PRP (platelet rich plasma) gel inside surgical theatre in order to favour and accelerate bone regeneration. A case of bifocal ulnar bone defect treated with stoichiometric HA-based bone substitute combined with PRP is reported in here, with a 12-month-radiographic follow-up.",93,2,89,96,Osseointegration; Surgery; Mesenchymal stem cell; Progenitor cell; Platelet-rich plasma; Bone regeneration; Calcium; Orthopedic surgery; Medicine; Scaffold,,"Accidents, Occupational; Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage; Bone Substitutes; Bone Transplantation; Ceramics; Debridement; Drug Implants; Durapatite/administration & dosage; External Fixators; Fracture Fixation/instrumentation; Fractures, Open/surgery; Fractures, Ununited/surgery; Humans; Internal Fixators; Intraoperative Complications/etiology; Male; Middle Aged; Osseointegration; Platelet-Rich Plasma; Surgical Flaps; Tissue Scaffolds; Ulna Fractures/etiology; Wound Infection/drug therapy",Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bone Substitutes; Drug Implants; Durapatite,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19711008/ https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/major-bone-defect-treatment-with-an-osteoconductive-bone-substitu https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12306-009-0028-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19711008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12306-009-0028-0,19711008,10.1007/s12306-009-0028-0,1987370961,,4,012-038-321-704-551; 013-518-311-401-003; 019-219-541-481-625; 019-637-475-126-490; 021-128-173-800-423; 033-138-155-163-015; 036-393-136-916-461; 042-527-579-167-701; 044-785-862-040-321; 045-187-875-374-976; 049-159-730-459-861; 053-448-562-847-376; 054-214-144-898-386; 056-749-275-734-940; 062-076-096-502-048; 065-581-171-260-058; 067-274-172-732-62X; 069-299-129-691-23X; 071-609-957-707-295; 071-785-075-479-684; 073-057-531-829-834; 073-532-930-972-005; 088-267-752-956-669; 094-039-889-826-745; 105-061-351-557-166; 110-663-797-689-867; 114-617-000-630-859; 125-064-446-852-888; 173-696-558-637-126,44,False,,,lens

Taking up the recommendations of the De Larosiere report, one of the main initiatives is the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which will have responsibility for identifying, monitoring, assessing and responding to potential threats and risks to financial stability in the EU. Subject to the endorsement of the underlying legal acts, this new body will receive analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support from the ECB. The establishment of the ESRB consequently has relevant implications for the statistical work of the ECB and the ESCB. The aim of this paper is to describe two key work streams that are being undertaken in order to prepare for the ESRB. These workstreams concern the enhancement of the Consolidated Banking Data (CBD) and the development of a statistical definition of Large Banking and Insurance Groups (LBIGs).",34,,18,27,Accounting; Business; Systemic risk; Work (electrical); Order (exchange); Key (cryptography); Financial crisis; Financial stability,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/h/bis/bisifc/34-03.html,https://ideas.repec.org/h/bis/bisifc/34-03.html,,,3121215418,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Some of the most urgent challenges facing those responsible for improving and regulating patient safety are therefore how to identify, interpret, integrate and act on the early warnings and weak signals of emerging risks—before those risks contribute to a disastrous failure of care. These challenges are fundamentally organisational and cultural: they relate to what information is routinely noticed, communicated and attended to within and between healthcare organisations—and, most critically, what is assumed and ignored. Analysing these organisational and cultural challenges suggests three practical ways that healthcare organisations and their regulators can improve safety and address emerging risks. First, engage in practices that actively produce and amplify fleeting signs of ignorance. Second, work to continually define and update a set of specific fears of failure. And third, routinely uncover and publicly circulate knowledge on the sources of systemic risks to patient safety and the improvements required to address them.",23,6,440,445,Systemic risk; Health care; Occupational safety and health; Safety culture; Patient safety; Poison control; Risk management; Computer security; Public relations; Health policy; Medicine,Communication; Health Policy; Incident Reporting; Risk Management; Safety Culture,Disasters/prevention & control; England; Hospital Administration/standards; Hospitals/standards; Humans; Malpractice/statistics & numerical data,,,https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/23/6/440.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24599729/ https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/lookup/ijlink/YTozOntzOjQ6InBhdGgiO3M6MTQ6Ii9sb29rdXAvaWpsaW5rIjtzOjU6InF1ZXJ5IjthOjQ6e3M6ODoibGlua1R5cGUiO3M6NDoiQUJTVCI7czoxMToiam91cm5hbENvZGUiO3M6MzoicWhjIjtzOjU6InJlc2lkIjtzOjg6IjIzLzYvNDQwIjtzOjQ6ImF0b20iO3M6MzA6Ii9ibWpxaXIvNi8xL3UyMjA5NDYudzcwNDEuYXRvbSI7fXM6ODoiZnJhZ21lbnQiO3M6MDoiIjt9 https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002685 https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/early/2014/03/22/bmjqs-2013-002685.full.pdf https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/23/6/440 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24599729 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24599729,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002685,24599729,10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002685,2126659329,,0,007-479-246-137-317; 013-054-962-626-692; 016-942-127-231-747; 041-864-831-117-687; 042-001-378-939-238; 046-141-756-303-123; 063-445-671-218-500; 063-806-439-029-191; 068-882-421-007-038; 083-065-500-762-051; 087-953-562-253-595; 100-760-125-947-490; 103-006-419-101-081; 112-865-308-568-684; 119-350-945-531-528; 141-072-103-758-283; 149-469-167-041-157; 155-925-548-401-797; 166-944-618-662-259; 180-442-977-984-206; 182-666-528-774-751; 183-653-722-434-850; 188-335-427-908-978; 190-738-710-780-795; 197-187-500-431-374,67,False,,,lens

Utilizing the approach of flow network theory, we show that the effect of adding a central clearing counterparty (CCP) is decomposed into two effects: central routing, and central netting effects. Each effect can produce different liquidity needs according to different liquidity scenarios. The analysis indicates that adding a CCP in times of financial distress successfully reduces the overall liquidity needs if and only if the netting efficiency of the CCP is sufficiently high. Furthermore, once the economy is no longer in financial distress, higher netting efficiency of the CCP could conversely increase the overall liquidity needs. The results have implications for the effectiveness of CCPs in mitigating systemic risk in times of financial distress, and their operating costs once the distress has passed.",13,1,9,50,Flow network; Clearing; Distress; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Counterparty; Netting; Financial distress; Financial system,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11403-017-0208-1.pdf https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/70765/1/Hayakawa2018_Article_DoesACentralClearingCounterpar.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-017-0208-1/fulltext.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:jeicoo:v:13:y:2018:i:1:d:10.1007_s11403-017-0208-1 https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2115/70765 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jeicoo/v13y2018i1d10.1007_s11403-017-0208-1.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-017-0208-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11403-017-0208-1,,10.1007/s11403-017-0208-1,3122845749,,0,004-532-440-296-902; 009-248-782-454-29X; 009-597-427-192-681; 011-834-679-293-487; 015-550-449-343-726; 021-232-552-790-667; 035-104-934-704-682; 049-995-932-866-186; 055-800-949-595-911; 059-336-898-625-242; 062-706-261-342-142; 077-629-059-549-279; 105-960-990-032-058; 160-835-374-644-925; 165-766-913-733-237; 167-961-598-934-229,8,True,cc-by,hybrid,lens

METHODS we performed a retrospective analysis of 319 patients hospitalized for erysipelas in our institution during a 10 year period. The statistical significance was examined by chi square and Kruskal-Wallis test (significant value p< or =0.05). RESULTS there were 35% males and 65% females patients. Median age was 63 years. Most of the female patients were pensioners (32.7%), most of the male patients were physical workers (40.5%). Summer time was the most frequent season for hospitalization (32.3%), and winter time was the rarest (17%). Most of the erysipelas has involved the lower limb (59.2%). There was significant dependence between the regional risk factors and occupation. The recurrent cases occurred in 67.3% cases with lower limb localisation in 69.44% cases. The most rare recurrent cases found on upper limb (6%). The systemic risk factors were associated with recurrent erysipelas in 69.44%. Complications, such as abscess formation, lymphangitis, venous insufficiency, osteitis, arthritis, septic tendonitis and elephantiasis were found in 25%.

Along this vein, a growing body of em‐ pirical research has already bloomed: [6] suggested a network approach to analyze the impact of liquidity shocks into financial systems; a similar approach was followed by [7] discussing the case of United Kingdom, Boss [8] for Austria, and [9] for Switzerland; more recently Sora‐ maki et. al.

Macroprudential supervision thus is a crucial policy challenge for EU28 in the context of BREXIT and the European Systemic Risk Board thus should have a critical role in 2018 and the following years. The ESRB should timely analyze the potential risk of BREXIT and consider adequate policy options to reduce or eliminate risks. Contract continuity as well as cooperation in prudential supervision between the EU27 and the UK stand for BREXIT-related problems that could create financial market stability - as is the BREXIT-induced UK deregulation pressure. EU prudential supervision post-BREXIT faces problems since a very large part of EU27 wholesale banking markets are in the UK and thus not regulated by the EU after March 29, 2019. The EU Commission's competence for EU trade policy as well as international investment treaties gives the EU the opportunity to offer the UK not only a - limited - Free Trade Agreement but an international investment treaty as well, including options for global cooperation.

We develop a duality-based distributed algorithm to solve it which is useful for applications where it is desirable to avoid centralized data gathering and computation. We also consider the problem of minimizing the expectation of the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities under the assumption that the net external asset holdings of all institutions are stochastic. We show that this problem is a two-stage stochastic linear program. To solve it, we develop two algorithms based on: Benders decomposition algorithm and projected stochastic gradient descent. We show that if the defaulting nodes never pay anything, the deterministic optimal cash injection allocation problem is an NP-hard mixed-integer linear program. However, modern optimization software enables the computation of very accurate solutions to this problem on a personal computer in a few seconds for network sizes comparable with the size of the US banking system. In addition, we address the problem of allocating the cash injection amount so as to minimize the number of nodes in default. For this problem, we develop two heuristic algorithms: a reweighted l1 minimization algorithm and a greedy algorithm. We illustrate these two algorithms using three synthetic network structures for which the optimal solution can be calculated exactly. We also compare these two algorithms on three types random networks which are more complex.",,,,,Mathematical optimization; Distributed algorithm; Heuristic (computer science); Asset (economics); Stochastic gradient descent; Financial networks; Personal computer; Computer science; Linear programming; Greedy algorithm,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1410.2570 https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1410.2570.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1410.2570,,,3121456152,,0,,0,False,,,lens

We use data only available to the Bank of Korea on banks' expected payments and build regression models for the remaining expected in- and outflows of liquidity. We find that the BOK-Wire+ system has relatively more evenly distributed payment flows than interbank payment systems in other countries. We identify ten core banks and measure their network positions (SinkRank) and intraday liquidity risks. The metrics presented in this article are especially suited for continuous oversight of intraday liquidity and systemic risks in payment systems.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Payment; Market liquidity; Core (game theory); Payment system; Monetary economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bok/wpaper/1401.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bok/wpaper/1401.html,,,3123913098,,0,,1,False,,,lens

We measure the impact of recent legislative changes in Australia upon systemic risk, for banking and near banking sectors, and demonstrate a significant reduction post the legislation. This is consistent with a major legislative goal, to promote global competitiveness, because it implies a reduction in the cost of equity capital. In addition, we find no evidence in support of the HIH collapse increasing systemic risk in the overall financial sector but a relatively small effect was detected in the banking sector.",,,,,Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Reform Act; Legislation; Financial risk management; Financial regulation; Financial system; Cost of capital,,,,,https://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/pdf/discussion/DP2005-12.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/rdgicmadp/icma-dp2005-12.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/rdgicmadp/icma-dp2005-12.htm,,,1558689155,,0,004-966-477-205-291; 010-423-042-177-734; 011-562-827-099-410; 021-444-614-603-594; 025-553-991-798-719; 028-809-688-907-391; 031-692-599-184-605; 031-991-690-222-190; 032-517-498-227-010; 045-681-505-605-849; 051-240-479-055-348; 053-992-943-857-702; 057-423-639-836-486; 067-669-964-030-649; 071-312-444-630-969; 071-822-808-161-420; 077-746-062-940-570; 080-045-535-143-683; 080-132-214-127-346; 081-458-476-752-332; 089-566-508-962-414; 094-358-924-704-988; 104-509-239-511-156; 111-975-495-738-570; 120-957-049-375-818; 132-452-987-853-38X; 134-630-711-831-253; 139-315-799-043-201; 140-958-688-530-95X; 144-051-414-827-430; 148-733-616-216-201; 149-490-928-299-029; 161-926-073-817-466; 173-719-285-876-103; 180-114-181-468-377; 182-401-964-998-619; 187-592-241-437-267,2,False,,,lens

We analyze financial crises as the breakage of a dynamic financial equilibrium. We suggest that when the equilibrium is stable, a small perturbation is absorbed by the market. On the other hand, when the market becomes unstable, perturbations propagate and amplify through the system, and contagion and systemic risk occur, resulting in a global financial crisis.; The market instability indicator is the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix of a dynamical system driving the evolution of the economy. Entries of this Jacobian matrix can be computed by estimating the elasticities of flows of funds between aggregate agents. The higher the elasticities, the larger the entries of the Jacobian matrix and the more unstable the economy. High leverage and borrowing capacity constraints increase elasticities and make the market unstable as soon as the market instability indicator is above the critical value 1.; In order to avoid deflation and economic collapse in 2008, the US government had a very strong reaction with Quantitative Easing and TARP. This put the market under rapid oscillations of very high amplitude and chaotic behavior, making long term forecasts inefficient. By correctly monitoring and utilizing elasticities, governments facing a major crisis may be able to optimize the efficiency of monetary and fiscal policies and accurately allocate their support to the various sectors of the economy, as opposed to being part of the origination of market chaos by inappropriate allocation of government resources.",,,453,480,Financial economics; Butterfly effect; Systemic risk; Economics; Jacobian matrix and determinant; Economic collapse; Financial crisis; Quantitative easing; Monetary economics; Deflation; Mathematical finance,,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00666752 https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00666752/ https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1733706 https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-on-systemic-risk/financial-crisis-and-contagion-a-dynamical-systems-approach/6E0944AE3F848CE05D7C88A2ABE71BFA https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1733706 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1733706,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9781139151184.024,,10.1017/cbo9781139151184.024,2221073436,,0,009-665-419-042-220; 011-966-485-404-147; 015-019-805-980-136; 017-879-639-284-727; 028-610-501-348-019; 030-761-621-340-783; 035-829-616-914-041; 040-254-949-205-098; 041-778-586-485-783; 042-573-326-770-358; 044-991-916-331-085; 046-124-028-435-115; 055-601-358-139-592; 109-621-246-749-594; 124-132-600-843-548; 139-269-556-617-632; 141-345-405-925-13X; 167-046-104-763-329,8,False,,,lens

In order to avoid the outbreak of financial crisis, economists and policy makers around the world pay special attention to the timely warning of financial crisis. If we can make an accurate early warning of the economic crisis, the government and regulatory agencies will have more time to deal with the possible risks and avoid major interference to economic growth. Based on this, this paper studies the spatial aggregation analysis and systemic risk prevention of Internet Finance Based on neural network model. Based on BP neural network, this paper constructs a spatial econometric model by using spatial econometric analysis method, and analyzes the empirical results of financial spatial aggregation. The results show that the Moran’s I value of China’s Internet finance index in December 2019 is 0.372, P value is 0.001, Moran’s I value of Internet payment is 0.395, P value is 0.002, Moran’s I value of Internet monetary fund is 0.357, P value is 0.001, Moran’s I value of Internet investment and financing is 0.324, P value is 0.002, Moran’s I of Internet insurance is 0.313, P value is 0.001. The results show that there is spatial agglomeration in the development of Internet finance in China. In addition, this paper also studies the systemic risk of Internet finance, analyzes its causes and puts forward corresponding preventive measures.</jats:p>",1744,4,042176,,The Internet; Risk analysis (engineering); Systemic risk; Spatial aggregation; Computer science; Artificial neural network,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JPhCS1744d2176X/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1744/4/042176,,10.1088/1742-6596/1744/4/042176,3133271489,,0,001-197-641-993-793; 007-793-465-347-037; 019-651-269-077-203; 031-216-905-262-214; 051-063-515-173-241; 062-365-980-537-12X; 068-949-985-251-750; 131-790-588-288-155,2,True,cc-by,gold,lens
110-904-856-642-589,Taxing banks: An evaluation of the German bank levy,,2014.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Claudia M. Buch; Björn Hilberg; Lena Tonzer,"Bank distress can have severe negative consequences for the stability of the financial system, the real economy, and public finances. Regimes for restructuring and restoring banks financed by bank levies and fiscal backstops seek to reduce these costs. Bank levies attempt to internalize systemic risk and increase the costs of leverage. This paper evaluates the effects of the German bank levy implemented in 2011 as part of the German bank restructuring law. Our analysis offers three main insights. First, revenues raised through the bank levy are minimal, because of low tax rates and high thresholds for tax exemptions. Second, the bulk of the payments were contributed by large commercial banks and the head institutes of savings banks and credit unions. Third, the levy had no effect on the volume of loans or interest rates for the average German bank. For the banks affected most by the levy, we find evidence of fewer loans, higher lending rates, and lower deposit rates.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Payment; German; Interest rate; Revenue; Real economy; Restructuring; Financial system; Leverage (finance),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/bubdps/382014.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ces:ceswps:_4704,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/bubdps/382014.html,,,3125661246,,0,,0,False,,,lens

It examines the relationship between efficiency and systemic risk, market power and liquidity risk, and diversification and liquidity risk. Banks were exposed to the systemic risk and liquidity risk during the recent financial crisis. My results show a dark side of efficiency and market power as they are per se explaining factors for the systemic and liquidity risk, but a bright side of diversification. The findings support the view that to foster stability, regulators should control efficiency level and market power and may relax diversification.",,,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Diversification (finance); Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Market power; Financial crisis; Bank risk; Monetary economics,,,,,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/120677/,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/120677/,,,2902610136,,0,002-501-328-481-070; 006-595-712-811-041; 021-682-248-071-789; 027-414-671-177-908; 029-395-557-156-056; 032-499-058-159-089; 041-879-603-351-537; 058-984-170-289-986; 062-938-103-637-028; 069-682-170-901-608; 070-903-956-191-670; 076-088-192-927-763; 083-314-018-992-988; 091-057-419-996-125; 113-028-404-947-447; 159-462-206-056-281; 162-700-398-724-262; 177-795-337-663-178,0,False,,,lens

Briggs; Clive E. Sabel; Kayoung Lee,"Environmental epidemiology and health risk and impact assessment have long grappled with problems of uncertainty in data and their relationships. These uncertainties have become more challenging because of the complex, systemic nature of many of the risks. A clear framework defining and quantifying uncertainty is needed. Three dimensions characterise uncertainty: its nature, its location and its level. In terms of its nature, uncertainty can be both intrinsic and extrinsic. The former reflects the effects of complexity, sparseness and nonlinearity; the latter arises through inadequacies in available observational data, measurement methods, sampling regimes and models. Uncertainty occurs in three locations: conceptualizing the problem, analysis and communicating the results. Most attention has been devoted to characterising and quantifying the analysis--a wide range of statistical methods has been developed to estimate analytical uncertainties and model their propagation through the analysis. In complex systemic risks, larger uncertainties may be associated with conceptualization of the problem and communication of the analytical results, both of which depend on the perspective and viewpoint of the observer. These imply using more participatory approaches to investigation, and more qualitative measures of uncertainty, not only to define uncertainty more inclusively and completely, but also to help those involved better understand the nature of the uncertainties and their practical implications.",31,2,189,203,Impact assessment; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Systemic risk; Uncertainty analysis; Range (mathematics); Environmental epidemiology; Observational study; Computer science; Management science; Conceptualization,,"Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants/toxicity; Humans; Models, Statistical; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty",Environmental Pollutants,Medical Research Council United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18972068 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/uncertainty-in-epidemiology-and-health-risk-assessment(36816a46-c1ea-41df-9ec4-1c76d9c21a44)/export.html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18972068/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10653-008-9214-5 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093163540 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18972068 https://core.ac.uk/download/29026862.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-008-9214-5,18972068,10.1007/s10653-008-9214-5,2143267889,,0,000-128-176-964-026; 000-702-103-215-706; 000-883-692-915-481; 001-076-504-667-392; 002-429-800-394-250; 005-569-588-048-580; 006-470-211-159-009; 011-291-850-060-918; 013-894-593-955-344; 014-058-367-243-501; 014-663-118-858-391; 015-146-945-708-38X; 015-902-983-885-804; 017-961-831-156-234; 018-148-492-153-120; 018-705-032-133-371; 022-156-039-127-092; 024-688-319-567-244; 029-665-971-774-682; 030-243-820-066-051; 030-883-685-837-719; 031-238-501-820-037; 033-044-859-535-182; 033-160-433-597-560; 037-568-421-955-337; 037-736-676-683-900; 037-994-427-279-917; 038-959-002-454-719; 040-708-452-316-300; 041-811-100-151-401; 047-705-003-414-280; 050-455-258-119-434; 052-001-196-169-79X; 052-336-673-561-175; 053-478-896-801-527; 054-263-028-803-379; 054-424-153-590-696; 054-793-518-105-627; 056-170-866-074-507; 058-142-173-467-409; 061-074-199-021-671; 066-407-510-979-490; 071-317-137-558-920; 073-568-374-387-239; 074-524-038-268-320; 074-839-261-612-426; 074-904-726-855-056; 076-670-432-494-228; 077-179-711-968-904; 079-113-809-397-32X; 082-478-559-660-18X; 083-540-708-446-525; 086-612-469-541-734; 086-629-908-953-695; 089-915-353-240-152; 093-359-149-488-193; 097-750-766-149-629; 100-007-276-923-648; 108-426-173-492-416; 119-018-794-488-15X; 124-234-601-197-434; 124-607-927-514-339; 125-970-596-089-026; 130-204-094-320-871; 132-625-181-392-695; 143-991-665-900-544; 144-256-565-292-276; 154-834-012-901-89X; 154-850-619-554-580; 174-450-610-272-029; 196-132-521-312-759,69,True,,green,lens

Accounts Receivable Financing (ARF) is a type of trade credit that facilitates Korean interfirm transactions. Under ARF, the obligation to reimburse the bank is imputed to the seller if the buyer does not repay the loan to the bank. When the buyer confronts a liquidity shortage and fails to repay the trade credits, unfortunately, the shock is not limited to damage to only the seller because it propagates throughout the interfirm network. The shock is easily propagated because it is highly likely that the seller would also be unable to repay obligations to its own sellers. Since annual interfirm networks follow a scale-free network model, a single liquidity shock triggers a systemic risk. The insolvency of topologically more central buyer firms is shown to pose a higher potential risk to the financial market. In contrast, the firm size is not significantly related to potential risk. Therefore, firms with high centrality should be closely monitored to prevent insolvency crisis and propagation of the liquidity shock in the interfirm network.",51,4,847,864,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Liquidity crisis; Market liquidity; Accounts receivable; Trade credit; Credit note; Insolvency; Shock (economics); Monetary economics,,,,National Research Foundation of Korea,https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/compec/v51y2018i4d10.1007_s10614-017-9648-x.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-017-9648-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10614-017-9648-x,,10.1007/s10614-017-9648-x,2574377251,,0,003-564-581-123-415; 004-682-225-354-448; 004-994-587-675-284; 007-821-088-127-164; 016-375-129-358-33X; 018-814-147-267-436; 020-699-158-967-631; 027-414-671-177-908; 027-746-101-549-133; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-582-421-227-58X; 034-618-882-762-654; 039-319-050-181-074; 040-641-017-492-12X; 040-801-336-012-314; 041-786-210-324-199; 045-777-161-498-037; 047-556-082-206-132; 051-247-735-446-586; 052-222-302-909-800; 055-478-320-871-920; 058-642-666-213-520; 060-008-099-465-150; 063-190-811-897-241; 063-747-800-214-332; 067-093-787-724-877; 075-566-833-293-404; 081-474-615-941-986; 081-957-743-526-556; 088-640-841-013-534; 090-965-708-499-843; 101-937-167-520-388; 105-395-385-823-338; 117-012-999-199-175; 117-903-132-807-368; 119-357-906-025-00X; 136-247-986-607-382; 146-379-268-595-433; 155-627-960-930-695; 156-948-496-672-314; 158-086-367-812-84X; 178-017-327-779-56X; 190-263-628-734-144; 197-158-784-937-381,6,False,,,lens

In addition, the evidence is strong that the stock markets of Taiwan and Malaysia are less risky for traders, whereas that of South Korea is risk-neutral.

INTRODUCTIONThe events that followed the 2008 financial crisis have shown that countries believed to be shielded against financial turmoil were much frailer than thought. Since then numerous voices pointed out the resemblance of the situation in the most challenged countries of the Eurozone with Argentina in 2001 [4][5][10][15a]. As it is well known, the convertibility of the Argentinean peso allowed the banks to carry dollar-nominated accounts, making their balance sheets susceptible to financial fragility at rapid exchange rate changes. While the latter were forbidden by law, the current account deficits and the increasing difficulties to pay back external obligations ended up forcing a default of the debt and a sharp and disordered devaluation of the currency. These events seemed, at the beginning, a source of endless mishaps but ended up (together with a rapid improvement of the international prices of Argentinean exports) creating the conditions for a fast rebound of the Argentinean economy [5] [9] [15a].It is no wonder then than a chorus of experts in various fields started recommending Greece (and eventually other EU members) to follow the Argentinean path [4] [5] [10] [14] [15a] [17] [18]. These arguments, based on rough analogies, deserve a closer analysis, which we intend to carry out in this paper. While this macroeconomic scenario has been analysed once and again in the macroeconomic literature (as well as by pundits and politicians), since the basis of comparison is a single case a strong justification in needed for making this assessment. Helmer and Rescher's ([13]) provide, fortunately, a sound foundation for such procedure. A counterfactual analysis based on the similarity of the two cases is the key. We focus here on such an exercise. To wit: are really the troubled euro-economies and 2001 Argentina so similar? And, if so, to what extent should be expect them to default on their debt and abandon the euro, as seen in the perspective of the 2001 devaluation of the peso? The answers to these questions require the formulation of an appropriate notion of similarity among economies and the exploration of means to infer future events out from analogies.The approach to be followed in this paper consists in applying Zadeh's ([25]) notion of fuzzy similarity to the comparison of the economic status of different nations. This formalization is intended to capture similarities among crisp objects. Nevertheless it is based on degrees of membership to sets of objects, namely those that satisfy some rather imprecisely defined (i.e. fuzzy) properties. While other approaches to similarity have been explored in the literature (e.g. [1] [2] [3] [8] [21] [24]) ours provides the right combination of soundness and simplicity required by the particular problem at hand. We find that 2001 Argentina and the troubled Eurozone countries belong to a common (fuzzy) equivalence class. From this we will draw the degree of possibility to be assigned to a devaluation and change of currency in the light of the events in Argentina a decade and a half ago.The plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we will provide a conventional account of the current economic situation in some European countries and 2001 Argentina. In section 3 we will discuss the epistemological justification for counterfactual analyses and the conditions under which they can be performed. In section 4 we introduce a version of fuzzy similarity and its application to the evaluation of future consequences in similar situations. In section 5 we apply it to the comparison of the aforementioned economies and draw conclusions for the Eurozone. Finally, section 6 concludes.2.

Specific data on drug users in correctional centres is not available for the majority of countries, including South Africa. The study aimed to identify the attitudes and knowledge of key informant (KI) offender and correctional centre staff regarding drug use, health and systemic-related problems so as to facilitate the long-term planning of activities in the field of drug-use prevention and systems strengthening in correctional centres, including suggestions for the development of appropriate intervention and rehabilitation programmes. Method: A Rapid Assessment Response (RAR) methodology was adopted which included observation, mapping of service providers (SP), KI interviews (staff and offenders) and focus groups (FGs). The study was implemented in Emthonjeni Youth Correctional Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Fifteen KI staff participants were interviewed and 45 KI offenders. Results: Drug use is fairly prevalent in the centre, with tobacco most commonly smoked, followed by cannabis and heroin. The banning of tobacco has also led to black-market features such as transactional sex, violence, gangsterism and smuggling in order to obtain mainly prohibited tobacco products, as well as illicit substances. Conclusion: HIV, health and systemic-related risk reduction within the Correctional Service sector needs to focus on measures such as improvement of staff capacity and security measures, deregulation of tobacco products and the development and implementation of comprehensive health promotion programmes.",11,1,11,11,Health psychology; Social work; Health promotion; Social policy; Transactional sex; Intervention (counseling); Harm reduction; Focus group; Medicine; Environmental health,,"Adolescent; Adult; Condoms/statistics & numerical data; Female; Focus Groups; HIV Infections/epidemiology; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/statistics & numerical data; Health Workforce; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Prisoners/statistics & numerical data; Prisons/statistics & numerical data; Risk-Taking; South Africa/epidemiology; Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology; Tuberculosis/epidemiology; Unsafe Sex/psychology; Young Adult",Illicit Drugs,PEPFAR United States,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/a1acfd14-06e7-3f03-8269-e2284ca0c30d/ http://www.harmreductionjournal.com/content/pdf/1477-7517-11-11.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1477-7517-11-11 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708609 https://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/21997 https://umkn-dsp01.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/21997?show=full https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3976637 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1477-7517-11-11.pdf https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7517-11-11 https://core.ac.uk/display/81050914,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1477-7517-11-11,24708609,10.1186/1477-7517-11-11,2104152410,PMC3976637,0,002-335-669-557-28X; 022-136-355-789-938; 024-685-498-097-351; 027-665-438-613-132; 031-699-769-255-798; 040-399-005-803-792; 055-169-382-850-552; 058-185-914-525-080; 058-734-995-768-875; 063-464-717-927-85X; 065-944-363-713-410; 068-373-866-747-535; 068-801-442-175-180; 071-190-592-243-941; 074-880-005-334-935; 098-412-774-036-485; 100-835-129-785-664; 101-524-576-285-467; 119-635-461-763-84X; 123-902-766-153-119; 131-977-904-360-893; 140-381-139-988-796; 150-918-357-694-93X; 174-268-991-715-91X,9,True,"CC BY, CC0",gold,lens

Focusing on systemic risk, shadow banking is defined as leveraging on collateral to support liquidity promises. Regulating shadow banking is efficient because of the negative externality stemming from systemic risk.

In this Policy Letter we discuss five different types of micro data that are crucial for monitoring (systemic) risk in the financial system, identifying and understanding inter-linkages in financial markets and thus have important implications for policymakers and regulatory authorities. We come to the conclusion that for all five areas of micro data, outlined in this Policy Letter (bank balance sheet data, asset portfolio data, market transaction data, market high frequency data and central bank data), the benefits of increased transparency greatly offset potential downsides. Hence, European policymakers would do well to follow the US example and close the sizeable gap in micro data transparency. For most cases, relevant data is already collected (at least on national level), but just not made available to academics for partly incomprehensible reasons. Overcoming these obstacles could foster financial stability in Europe and assure level playing fields with US regulators and policymakers.",,,,,Business; Balance sheet; Financial market; Transparency (market); Portfolio; Financial stability; Central bank; Frequency data; National level; Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:safepl:67,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:safepl:67,,,2806733800,,0,,0,False,,,lens

A recent study found that COVID-19 adult patients with diabetes, without other comorbidities, were at greater risk of numerous diseases COVID related, such as severe pneumonia and excessive uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Besides, serum levels of inflammation-related biomarkers, such as IL-6, were found to be higher in diabetic patients than healthy subjects, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to the inflammatory storm that leads to rapid health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. ; Our hypothesis origins from strict relationship, established, between periodontitis, as being able to induce production of IL-6, and diabetes in adult patients. Hence, by evaluating the associations previously described (COVID-19 and IL-6, COVID-19 and diabetes, IL-6 and diabetes) one wonders if, at least in diabetic patients, there could be a role for periodontitis, as a systemic risk factor, in the worst COVID-19 evolution. ; Periodontitis and oral health status can be very important in the evaluation of COVID-19 behavior and the clinicians must examine the oral health status in these patients.; p.s.

It argues that the FSB’s assessment of the role of equity is too narrow, being phrased in terms of bankruptcy avoidance and risk-taking incentives, without attention to debt overhang creating distortions in funding choices, the systemic impact of ample equity reducing deleveraging needs after losses, or equity contributing to smoothing of lending and asset purchases over time. The FSB’s treatment of systemic risk also pays too little attention to the mutual interdependence of different parts of the system, which is not well captured by linear causal relationships. Finally, the article points out that bank resolution of systemically important institutions is still not viable, due to lack of political acceptance of single-point-of-entry procedures and bail-in.

Markrisiko ist definiert als das Risiko, auf Grund von Wertruckgangen in Wertpapierportfolios Geld zu verlieren. Systemisches Risiko bezieht sich auf das Risiko des Zusammenbruchs eines Finanzsystems, das durch die Notlage eines einzelnen Finanzinstituts entsteht. Im Zuge der Finanzkrise 2007–2009 realisierten sich beide Risiken, was weltweit zu hohen Verlusten fur Investoren, Unternehmen und Steuerzahler fuhrte. Vor diesem Hintergrund besteht sowohl bei Finanzinstituten als auch bei Regulierungsbehorden Interesse an neuen Ansatzen fur das Risikomanagement. Die Gemeinsamkeit der in dieser Dissertation entwickelten Methoden besteht darin, dass unterschiedliche Quantilsregressionsansatze in neuartiger Weise fur das Finanzrisikomanagement verwendet werden. Zum einen wird nichtparametrische Quantilsregression mit Extremwertmethoden kombiniert, um extreme Markpreisanderungsrisiken zu prognostizieren. Das resultierende Value at Risk (VaR) Prognose- Modell fur extremeWahrscheinlichkeiten wird auf internationale Aktienindizes angewandt. In vielen Fallen schneidet es besser ab als parametrische Vergleichsmodelle. Zum anderen wird ein Mas fur systemisches Risiko, das realized systemic risk beta, eingefuhrt. Anders als bereits existierende Messgrosen erfasst es explizit sowohl Risikoabhangigkeiten zwischen Finanzinstituten als auch deren individuelle Bilanzmerkmale und Finanzsektor-Indikatoren. Um die relevanten Risikotreiber jedes einzelnen Unternehmens zu bestimmen, werden Modellselektionsverfahren fur hochdimensionale Quantilsregressionen benutzt. Das realized systemic risk beta entspricht dem totalen Effekt eines Anstiegs des VaR eines Unternehmens auf den VaR des Finanzsystems. Anhand von us-amerikanischen und europaischen Daten wird gezeigt, dass die neue Messzahl sich gut zur Erfassung und Vorhersage systemischen Risikos eignet.%%%%This thesis develops new methods to assess two types of financial risk. Market risk is defined as the risk of losing money due to drops in the values of asset portfolios. Systemic risk refers to the breakdown risk for the financial system induced by the distress of individual companies. During the financial crisis 2007–2009, both types of risk materialized, resulting in huge losses for investors, companies, and tax payers all over the world. Therefore, considering new risk management alternatives is of interest for both financial institutions and regulatory authorities. A common feature of the models used throughout the thesis is that they adapt quantile regression techniques to the context of financial risk management in a novel way. Firstly, to predict extreme market risk, nonparametric quantile regression is combined with extreme value theory. The resulting extreme Value at Risk (VaR) forecast framework is applied to different international stock indices. In many situations, its performance is superior to parametric benchmark models.

And if such issues influence systemic stability, what design features of the bond and characteristics of the issuing insurer cause catastrophe bond issues to destabilize the financial sector? Contrary to current conjectures of insurance regulators, we find that the contribution of ceding insurers to systemic risk actually decreases significantly after the issue of a catastrophe bond. We empirically confirm that a higher pre-issue leverage, a higher firm valuation and previous cat bond issues all exert a decreasing effect on the issuer's systemic risk contribution.",,,,,Financial economics; Issuer; Business; Systemic risk; Valuation (finance); Insurance industry; Financial sector; Monetary economics; Bond; Leverage (finance); Catastrophe bond,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/46912862 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=2313160 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2313478_code1088953.pdf?abstractid=2313160&mirid=1&type=2 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2313160 https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/handle/2003/30558 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46912862.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.17877/de290r-10757,,10.17877/de290r-10757,1508682587,,0,000-700-018-033-183; 000-846-266-307-085; 001-274-723-652-948; 001-739-658-391-055; 008-214-076-742-786; 009-480-719-270-961; 018-075-278-238-815; 019-458-844-234-347; 019-937-962-675-467; 020-072-458-778-606; 020-985-788-131-158; 026-203-168-061-813; 031-635-757-662-158; 032-760-930-803-882; 033-706-168-858-273; 035-051-823-297-424; 035-060-457-301-183; 035-104-934-704-682; 039-972-308-406-173; 042-997-738-525-307; 050-866-271-671-182; 057-256-061-870-550; 059-348-857-216-133; 064-918-277-007-696; 072-429-585-414-595; 075-401-188-052-732; 076-142-606-174-306; 081-740-060-661-874; 083-508-652-775-775; 091-729-685-723-516; 095-797-653-656-558; 096-126-544-970-889; 099-720-321-687-358; 103-836-899-223-098; 105-333-746-467-516; 107-535-438-547-416; 122-773-024-323-583; 122-779-428-131-390; 125-064-204-562-095; 127-434-609-562-040; 129-092-199-993-707; 129-846-418-400-093; 135-250-650-812-295; 136-551-366-298-183; 138-846-679-974-825; 146-277-834-370-697; 166-853-241-014-847; 169-852-394-492-000; 185-377-408-189-695,4,True,,,lens

The crisis has revealed numerous drawbacks and shortcomings in the financial system, and imposed, as the priority issue, the revision of the role of regulation. In the short run, the focus was on the system's recovery and its continued functioning. In the long run, this is not enough. What will be needed is a complete redesign of the supervisory functions, especially in terms of facing the issue of systemic risk. The problem of a new regulatory framework is particularly prominent in the European Union, which has suffered the most from the debt crisis, and which, as a supra-national institution, is truly abundant with differences and internal contradictions. The new supervisory framework in the European Union is inevitable, and its success will mostly be reflected in its ability to solve the issue of the scope of control, the issues of large fiscal deficits, and to overcome the huge interest spread in respect of certain member states' debt.",42,4,96,109,Finance; Debt; Systemic risk; Political science; Social system; Order (exchange); Short run; Debt crisis; European union; Net interest spread,,,,,https://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=1451-43541304096K,https://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=1451-43541304096K,,,2597136839,,0,085-342-394-542-56X,0,False,,,lens

Not only do we implement simulations in order to detect prospective defaulters, we also estimate the probabilities of actual firm bankruptcies and compare the predicted defaults and actual defaults. We find, first, that an economically sizable number of firms are predicted to fail when their customers default on their trade debt. Second, these prospective defaulters are indeed more likely to go bankrupt than other firms. Third, firms that have abundant external sources of financing or whose transaction partners have such abundant sources are less likely to go bankrupt even when they are predicted to default. This provides evidence for the existence and relevance of firms – called “deep pockets” by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) – that can act as shock absorbers.",137,,259,281,Debt; Systemic risk; Relevance (law); Economics; Microeconomics; Order (exchange); Trade credit; Monetary economics; Default; Database transaction,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejeborg/v_3a137_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a259-281.htm http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/25354/1/ifn_wp020.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/59083655 https://www.rieti.go.jp/jp/events/12112901/pdf/p04_uesugi.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268117300410 http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/handle/10086/28392 http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/ifn/result/doc/ifn_wp020.pdf https://hdl.handle.net/10086/28392 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeborg/v137y2017icp259-281.html https://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/handle/10086/28392 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268117300410 http://www.jeameetings.org/2013s/Pabstract/E-009abstract_MakotoHazama.pdf https://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/ifn/result/doc/ifn_wp020.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/59083655.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2017.02.009,,10.1016/j.jebo.2017.02.009,1562948735,,0,005-304-282-655-405; 007-245-054-928-112; 018-858-686-744-822; 023-310-771-796-798; 029-652-108-487-444; 031-500-031-831-540; 033-352-195-945-772; 041-831-268-591-775; 044-333-105-793-556; 075-897-862-903-52X; 080-955-033-876-265; 088-149-451-347-256; 092-485-272-350-203; 109-381-535-599-334; 109-615-878-982-393; 111-106-436-250-546; 131-866-092-815-474; 132-360-602-159-322; 134-372-216-189-401; 145-067-436-495-724; 156-948-496-672-314; 167-746-150-850-631; 169-451-869-031-762; 191-839-600-715-414; 199-540-385-710-008,5,True,,green,lens

Gerding; Simon Wolfe,"Abstract We develop a model in which margin procyclicality and the propensity for liquidity hoarding interact to generate a systemic liquidity crisis. In this model, banks lend and borrow in the interbank market to mitigate liquidity risk and trade derivatives contracts in the OTC derivatives market to mitigate market risk. The daily mark-to-market of derivatives contracts results in daily margin calls that banks cover using high quality liquid assets. We find that distress due to margin procyclicality in the derivatives market can spillover to the interbank market leading to systemic liquidity risk. Interconnectedness further amplifies the effects of systemic risk within the interbank market. The model shows that central clearing might increase the possibility of systemic liquidity risk due to tight margin requirements and the timing of cash flows required from banks. We also find that haircut levels affect the possibility of systemic liquidity risk, and highlight the potential role of a market maker of last resort in limiting this possibility.",58,,78,95,Systemic risk; Economics; Interbank lending market; Liquidity crisis; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Market maker; Monetary economics; Market risk; Derivatives market,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/intfin/v58y2019icp78-95.html https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/17555 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423160/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443118300106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intfin.2018.09.007,,10.1016/j.intfin.2018.09.007,2898853826,,0,001-927-229-046-69X; 003-596-779-015-045; 006-381-442-206-445; 007-236-021-000-209; 009-248-782-454-29X; 011-557-797-622-744; 012-925-826-648-197; 014-957-372-972-863; 017-550-858-667-206; 017-750-425-646-422; 019-687-296-589-620; 020-586-688-906-501; 020-699-158-967-631; 021-232-552-790-667; 024-488-187-774-500; 026-246-516-312-202; 027-800-543-510-206; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-352-937-146-744; 035-104-934-704-682; 035-266-738-235-681; 038-000-306-294-814; 040-801-336-012-314; 043-124-543-317-966; 046-168-423-281-579; 048-391-366-548-314; 050-337-097-629-46X; 051-081-097-611-657; 051-803-096-938-756; 057-009-805-315-309; 059-561-895-518-856; 062-555-412-427-982; 062-665-995-202-765; 065-327-126-170-308; 066-726-956-150-060; 068-750-519-850-694; 075-897-862-903-52X; 079-621-134-343-307; 080-429-212-781-296; 086-400-934-368-507; 088-149-451-347-256; 092-475-529-508-995; 093-046-829-183-513; 094-366-833-545-889; 101-703-894-064-954; 101-731-103-558-535; 103-149-579-236-151; 106-840-243-371-267; 112-244-550-443-490; 120-042-802-996-855; 120-509-336-114-996; 133-299-721-960-880; 137-103-177-601-902; 137-212-336-207-420; 139-580-627-412-741; 141-532-877-945-124; 156-423-990-605-377; 183-925-739-343-476,14,True,,green,lens

Lo,"Breakthroughs in computing hardware, software, telecommunications, and data analytics have transformed the financial industry, enabling a host of new products and services such as automated trading algorithms, crypto-currencies, mobile banking, crowdfunding, and robo-advisors. However, the unintended consequences of technology-leveraged finance include firesales, flash crashes, botched initial public offerings, cybersecurity breaches, catastrophic algorithmic trading errors, and a technological arms race that has created new winners, losers, and systemic risk in the financial ecosystem. These challenges are an unavoidable aspect of the growing importance of finance in an increasingly digital society. Rather than fighting this trend or forswearing technology, the ultimate solution is to develop more robust technology capable of adapting to the foibles in human behavior so users can employ these tools safely, effectively, and effortlessly.

However, current commodity trading systems (such as spot, futures, and forward contract) are still traditional centralized structures, which means that there may always be concerned about the single point of failure and data corruption. Besides, even though there already exists fragmentary decentralized applications (DApps) for the marketplace, order management, resale, delivery, financing, and insurance, they are not integrated for operating contract production and transaction comprehensively. In this work, a blockchain-enabled integrated marketing platform (BeIMP) is proposed for contract production and transactions. BeIMP is a consortium blockchain (CsBc) framework that enables better safety, efficiency, and interoperability among stakeholders. BeIMP can directly match producers and consumers and reduce the problem of intermediaries’ improper market operation. BeIMP has a three-tier risk diversification mechanism. First, both parties can know the quantity and price according to the contract specification (CSpec) in advance to avoid future uncertainty. Second, the buyers can resell the established order if they need, thereby diversifying the risk. Third, the concept of insurance is introduced to reduce force majeure and other systemic risks. BeIMP can also help producers get the loan from the financial institution (FI) if they need fund for production. We implement and demonstrate the prototype in contract farming (CF) first and discuss its generalizability to other scenarios. Experiment results show that the smart contract (SC) function is stable enough and the proof of authority (PoA) has the advantage in throughput and can give users a better experience.",8,,211007,211027,Futures contract; Intermediary; Business; Systemic risk; Force majeure; Smart contract; Contract farming; Forward contract; Industrial organization; Database transaction,,,,"Research and implementation development of a huge data security collection system for machines based on edge computing, from the AI Center, Tung-Hai University",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9265212/ https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039620 https://scholar.nycu.edu.tw/en/publications/blockchain-enabled-integrated-market-platform-for-contract-produc https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access8.html#LiaoLY20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3039620,,10.1109/access.2020.3039620,3110335306,,0,001-780-810-658-450; 003-797-536-688-879; 004-031-419-697-124; 006-598-400-325-769; 008-010-382-860-348; 011-748-145-166-714; 012-046-164-695-996; 012-416-301-078-19X; 017-166-148-957-755; 019-231-589-676-044; 026-426-278-110-688; 031-409-957-370-445; 044-935-248-148-149; 047-398-775-632-600; 047-689-016-497-014; 048-016-834-583-205; 049-747-320-115-151; 050-410-371-991-743; 052-270-995-768-006; 053-708-356-159-167; 055-050-784-061-400; 059-386-145-723-791; 070-729-291-655-360; 071-730-119-056-184; 078-020-637-042-354; 078-177-438-579-218; 084-405-479-006-095; 089-141-590-296-129; 090-735-306-830-472; 096-126-705-119-818; 096-210-991-451-214; 103-464-738-994-241; 123-587-318-628-080; 141-233-018-646-775; 154-669-270-509-106; 160-684-759-985-979; 177-719-252-404-99X,11,True,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold,lens

The SER spread is perceived as an important indicator of interbank trust in the Eurozone and its elevated level normally signals distortion and mistrust among commercial banks with a power to spill over into the whole financial sector. Recent development on interbank markets and especially within monetary policy in the Eurozone could have impaired the ability of the SER spread to act as a proxy for global systemic risk. The SER spread in this study was constructed and calculated using relevant European financial data and the consequent analysis was made on intraday and high-frequency (HF) 2015-2017 data. The ECB's APP, mainly PSPP, together with other instruments of monetary policy have impact on both legs of the SER spread and this paper tries to identify and quantify the degree of this effect by detailed HF market data analysis. HF intraday approach analysis is also being implemented in order to identify which leg of the SER spread was decisive in determining the SER spread change in the first three years of the PSPP implementation.

083-594-077-325-180,Bank Size Effect in the Deposit Market: Evidence from Bank Branch Ownership Changes,2015-07-01,2015.0,journal article,Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal,10963685,Allied Academies,United States,Huabing Wang,"INTRODUCTION The most recent financial crisis has put large banks under the spotlight for the systematic risks they bring to the economy. The massive bailout of these banks has been troubling for regulators. During a senate hearing on establishing a framework for systemic risk regulation in 2009, Sheila Bair, then Chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), states that ""the notion of too big to fail creates a vicious circle that needs to be broken."" She further states in her testimony the need to ""develop a resolution regime that provides for the orderly wind-down of large, systemically important financial firms, without imposing large costs to the taxpayer."" While debatable, many even have advocated the breaking-up of large banks to avoid the ""too-big-to-fail"" problem and future financial catastrophe. The Progressive Change Institute, who recently released a poll result showing bipartisan backing for breaking up big banks, is an example of such advocate groups (Schroeder, 2015). The Economist magazine held a debate on whether big banks should be broken up on May 14, 2013, and the post-debate poll indicated favorable public sentiment with 83% yes vote. However, technology advances and heightened regulation have favored large banks as never before. For example, Wheelock and Wilson (2010) suggest that information technology has tended to favor larger institutions for two reasons. First, larger institutions can more easily bear the relatively high fixed cost of information processing equipment and software. Secondly, the new technologies have eroded the value of close proximity and personal relationships in gaining soft information, which has been an advantage of small institutions. Regarding regulation, Peirce et al (2014) conduct a small bank survey covering 200 banks across 41 states, and report substantially increased compliance costs in the wake of new regulations such as Dodd-Frank for participating banks. Indeed, according to FDIC data, U.S. banking assets and deposits have continued to consolidate since the financial crisis of 2008. Tracy (2013) reports in a Wall Street Journal article that the number of federally insured institutions has shrank to 6,891 in the third quarter of 2013, and community banks might be ""too small to survive"". While technology and regulation both put small banks at a disadvantage, community banks have many advantages compared with large banks in the deposit market. The ability to source low-cost stable core deposits can significantly lower bank funding cost, contributing to the bank's financial well-being. Small banks are known for their more personalized services, lower checking fees, and more lending flexibility (Kadlec, 2014). According to the 2013 Banking satisfaction study by J. D. Powers, smaller banks have higher scores regarding fees and problem resolution. At the same time, the ability of banks to attract transaction and savings deposits from businesses and consumers is an important measure of a bank's acceptance by the public (Rose and Hudgins, 2012, P. 397). Community banks are viewed as part of the local economy, and indeed, they tend to keep their sourced deposits in the local community. In the wake of the recent global financial crisis, the resentment towards the largest banks of the country has grown, and as mentioned earlier, the idea of breaking up large banks has gained support and advocated by many advocate groups. Therefore, the depositor sentiment may also play in the smaller banks' favor. Of course, large banks do offer more convenience thanks to their larger branch and ATM network. The scale of economy allows them to provide more cutting-edge technology and security features appreciated by customers (Kadlec, 2014). On balance, it is an empirical question whether larger or smaller banks have an upper hand in the competition for deposits. This paper attempts to shed light on this question. Specifically, we examine the effect of bank size on deposit market competition, by utilizing a natural laboratory setting where branch offices experience ownership change among banks of different sizes. …",19,3,309,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Monetary system; Financial crisis; Bailout; Too big to fail; Competition (economics); Economies of scale; Financial system; Bank run,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3965157971/bank-size-effect-in-the-deposit-market-evidence-from,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3965157971/bank-size-effect-in-the-deposit-market-evidence-from,,,2586236706,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Kwast and de Nicolo (2002) put systemic risk and (conditional) stock price correlations into a unique relation. Adopting this perspective, we provide a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC, Engle, 2002) analysis for the European banking sector. Our sample period covers establishment and advent of the Euro. Apart from time variation of correlation measures we investigate the content of exogenous factor variables to explain correlation patterns. Overall, we find a moderate and stable average level of systemic risk in European banking. The advent of the Euro came along with a 1-year period of short-run transition dynamics.

In particular, interbank credit networks shape the core of the financial system, in which a time-varying interconnected risk emerges from a massive number of temporal transactions between banks. The current lack of understanding of the mechanics of interbank networks makes it difficult to evaluate and control systemic risk. Here, we uncover fundamental dynamics of interbank networks by seeking the patterns of daily transactions between individual banks. We find stable interaction patterns between banks from which distinctive network-scale dynamics emerge. In fact, the dynamical patterns discovered at the local and network scales share common characteristics with social communication patterns of humans. To explain the origin of ""social"" dynamics in interbank networks, we provide a simple model that allows us to generate a sequence of synthetic daily networks characterized by the observed dynamical properties. The discovery of dynamical principles at the daily resolution will enhance our ability to assess systemic risk and could contribute to the real-time management of financial stability.",,,,,Financial economics; Business; Systemic risk; Control (management); Financial networks; Financial crisis; Simple (philosophy); Social communication; Financial stability; Social dynamics,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1703.10832 https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1703.10832.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1703.10832,,,3121399930,,0,,0,False,,,lens
081-489-376-256-587,Essays on Financial Intermediation,,2018.0,dissertation,,,,,A. F. Silva,"This thesis includes three essays investigating different aspects of financial intermediation.; ; Chapter 1 examines the impact of banks’ collective liquidity mismatch policies on the stability of the financial sector. Using a novel identification strategy exploiting the presence of partially overlapping peer groups, I show that the liquidity created by individual banks is driven by the liquidity transformation activity of their peers. These correlated liquidity mismatch decisions are asymmetric and concentrated on the asset-side component of liquidity creation. Importantly, this strategic behavior increases both the default risk of individual institutions and overall systemic risk. From a macroprudential perspective, the results highlight the importance of explicitly regulating systemic liquidity risk.; ; Chapter 2 analyzes the credit supply and real sector effects of bank bail-ins by exploiting the unexpected failure of a major Portuguese bank and subsequent resolution. Using a matched firm-bank dataset on credit exposures and interest rates, we show that while banks more exposed to the bail-in significantly reduced credit supply at the intensive margin, affected firms compensated the tightening of overall credit with other sources of funding. Nevertheless, SMEs were subject to a binding contraction of funds available through credit lines and reduced investment and employment. These dampening effects are explained by the pre-shock internal liquidity position of smaller firms.; ; Finally, Chapter 3 examines the impact of a nationwide banking expansion program on access to finance as well as first-time borrowers’ transition from microfinance institutions to the formal banking sector using microdata on the universe of loans to individuals from a developing country. We show that the program increased the likelihood of obtaining credit, particularly in areas with lower financial and economic development. The overall effect is driven by the newly set-up microfinance institutions (U-SACCOs), which grant loans to unbanked individuals and allow them to build credit history. Loan size increases and loan terms improve as the bank-borrower relationship matures, but these effects are weaker for U-SACCOs than for banks. Consistent with this evidence, a significant share of first-time borrowers switch to commercial banks, which cream-skim less risky borrowers from U-SACCOs after the program implementation and grant them cheaper, larger, and longer-term loans. These borrowers are not riskier and only initially receive smaller loans than similar individuals already in the formal banking sector. These results suggest that the microfinance sector, together with a credit reference bureau, plays an essential role in mitigating information frictions in credit markets.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Loan; Access to finance; Microfinance; Financial intermediary; Credit history; Financial system,,,,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/20150/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.753672,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/20150/,,,2895144076,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Previous literature has identified the urgent need to develop national strategic modelling and predictive simulation capabilities for the global financial markets in order to improve our understanding of systemic risk and thus, better deal with the potential for future financial disasters. It has also been argued that the development of such systems would require a multidisciplinary effort into agent theory, ecology, epidemiology and complex systems simulation models in order to develop tools that can be used to inform governmental policy.

Cunningham; Avrum I. Gotlieb,"Although the pathobiology of atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial process, blood flow-induced shear stress has emerged as an essential feature of atherogenesis. This fluid drag force acting on the vessel wall is mechanotransduced into a biochemical signal that results in changes in vascular behavior. Maintenance of a physiologic, laminar shear stress is known to be crucial for normal vascular functioning, which includes the regulation of vascular caliber as well as inhibition of proliferation, thrombosis and inflammation of the vessel wall. Thus, shear stress is atheroprotective. It is also recognized that disturbed or oscillatory flows near arterial bifurcations, branch ostia and curvatures are associated with atheroma formation. Additionally, vascular endothelium has been shown to have different behavioral responses to altered flow patterns both at the molecular and cellular levels and these reactions are proposed to promote atherosclerosis in synergy with other well-defined systemic risk factors. Nonlaminar flow promotes changes to endothelial gene expression, cytoskeletal arrangement, wound repair, leukocyte adhesion as well as to the vasoreactive, oxidative and inflammatory states of the artery wall. Disturbed shear stress also influences the site selectivity of atherosclerotic plaque formation as well as its associated vessel wall remodeling, which can affect plaque vulnerability, stent restenosis and smooth muscle cell intimal hyperplasia in venous bypass grafts. Thus, shear stress is critically important in regulating the atheroprotective, normal physiology as well as the pathobiology and dysfunction of the vessel wall through complex molecular mechanisms that promote atherogenesis.",85,1,9,23,Anatomy; Cytoskeleton; Shear stress; Artery; Inflammation; Atheroma; Intimal hyperplasia; Thrombosis; Pathogenesis; Biology; Cell biology,,"Animals; Arteriosclerosis/etiology; Humans; Shear Strength; Stress, Mechanical",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15568038 https://www.nature.com/articles/3700215.pdf http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/labinvest.3700215 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15568038/ https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/331f0534-27d4-30b6-8110-1671e124b448/ https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201102203437447649 https://nature.com/articles/3700215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/labinvest.3700215,15568038,10.1038/labinvest.3700215,1967296654,,13,000-082-592-160-210; 000-215-399-545-369; 000-328-909-063-126; 000-500-184-054-514; 000-784-201-270-655; 001-336-212-407-001; 001-361-862-500-181; 001-752-989-616-235; 002-445-989-778-812; 002-795-956-087-652; 002-884-429-746-171; 002-906-426-601-537; 003-129-088-315-716; 003-338-846-543-234; 003-568-149-394-177; 003-596-509-994-458; 004-002-169-487-606; 004-735-668-661-371; 005-494-716-209-761; 006-838-893-359-78X; 006-941-920-033-896; 007-448-984-639-683; 007-681-663-737-822; 007-872-841-037-119; 008-041-302-972-879; 008-395-010-913-189; 008-982-220-771-330; 009-070-275-452-876; 009-443-765-483-842; 009-881-759-332-634; 010-270-911-712-950; 011-047-867-730-346; 011-985-775-941-040; 012-274-630-610-529; 012-452-090-562-923; 012-475-452-178-243; 012-762-050-186-875; 012-896-025-579-590; 013-530-366-288-783; 014-145-984-133-75X; 014-451-060-418-435; 014-569-260-699-490; 016-017-323-188-098; 016-750-163-948-941; 017-417-565-658-311; 018-024-995-402-438; 018-324-093-591-932; 019-659-721-269-030; 019-729-441-837-241; 020-782-506-634-970; 020-802-924-370-977; 021-122-492-232-542; 022-055-126-470-830; 022-127-464-117-116; 022-734-653-152-425; 023-101-850-120-859; 024-144-907-769-39X; 024-627-868-691-425; 026-899-583-387-165; 027-756-629-056-512; 027-834-483-830-499; 028-289-026-483-749; 028-657-690-831-306; 029-390-174-685-53X; 030-520-122-432-870; 030-867-520-888-956; 031-026-831-089-043; 031-330-448-323-470; 033-780-640-481-680; 034-103-867-504-558; 034-693-974-001-481; 037-723-782-693-659; 038-099-542-338-471; 038-346-823-501-197; 038-432-977-788-232; 038-708-928-441-034; 038-797-205-179-084; 038-948-768-543-893; 039-553-667-283-447; 039-621-807-663-305; 039-817-928-432-663; 040-928-873-043-472; 042-642-499-613-613; 044-293-348-210-358; 044-563-925-235-385; 046-034-258-252-34X; 047-716-443-001-045; 047-977-274-878-393; 047-985-472-392-669; 048-820-241-588-139; 049-472-602-956-581; 049-709-559-393-877; 050-651-772-160-825; 051-024-853-182-069; 051-115-842-035-219; 051-168-056-447-936; 053-403-219-141-553; 054-178-523-118-209; 054-434-666-611-56X; 055-288-731-248-335; 055-445-951-132-146; 056-159-906-543-834; 056-791-396-212-152; 057-718-401-085-676; 060-116-458-258-478; 060-506-538-420-416; 061-504-903-468-950; 061-969-936-141-567; 062-008-300-909-650; 062-999-817-590-064; 063-367-493-094-750; 063-796-071-401-330; 064-519-774-847-014; 065-927-598-034-717; 066-028-935-816-152; 067-321-209-875-376; 068-568-528-264-039; 068-873-330-380-481; 069-029-459-885-854; 069-679-117-485-628; 072-232-355-001-622; 072-824-147-852-747; 073-993-082-698-681; 075-203-950-049-985; 075-538-977-276-576; 075-830-312-914-885; 076-144-379-120-349; 076-738-305-790-030; 077-670-070-897-551; 079-487-009-622-249; 080-247-830-347-377; 080-255-607-933-971; 081-483-922-956-509; 084-752-673-307-875; 085-078-286-254-640; 085-547-245-863-254; 086-178-524-447-320; 088-189-244-809-67X; 089-795-599-187-28X; 090-025-707-347-944; 090-342-740-776-299; 090-509-605-600-778; 095-381-593-396-416; 096-929-557-037-819; 097-324-897-547-553; 097-487-010-001-514; 098-052-987-172-361; 098-055-175-469-374; 098-180-966-264-618; 099-391-604-578-632; 099-580-568-359-389; 100-537-938-156-416; 102-147-358-052-337; 102-902-798-082-691; 104-897-890-011-238; 107-179-829-888-519; 109-885-235-306-826; 111-014-950-296-135; 113-274-505-701-378; 114-991-136-031-951; 116-490-786-193-861; 117-090-502-689-333; 118-191-903-850-641; 119-563-829-002-214; 123-864-011-516-853; 123-961-249-292-938; 125-445-394-700-901; 126-069-543-597-005; 127-124-636-828-357; 128-264-619-915-505; 130-643-006-875-880; 130-713-718-710-065; 135-212-276-137-199; 140-234-347-576-761; 140-925-410-382-111; 140-962-164-714-143; 145-278-929-283-666; 150-893-945-967-086; 153-159-737-294-844; 161-861-339-857-349,882,True,,bronze,lens

DR is a leading cause of loss of vision patients at a productive age. Current treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) is distressing, expensive, and not suitable for some patient subgroups. For this reason, the development and progression of DR and DME are affected by many systemic risk factors. It is important to increase the understanding of these responsible risk factors and develop preventive strategies. However, the presence of systemic risk factors is inadequate to predict the progression of the disease on an individual basis. It indicates the presence of a genetic effect. In this review, we have summarized the known systemic risk factors as well as the genetic basis of the disease under the light of genetic studies.</jats:p>",,,102,107,Medicine; Disease; Diabetic retinopathy; Diabetic macular edema; Diabetes mellitus; Intensive care medicine; Retinopathy; Macular edema; Ophthalmology; Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Retinal,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.37783/crj-0077,,10.37783/crj-0077,,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Drew; Thanula R. Wijeratne,This study examines the effects of systemic risk on global hedge fund returns. We consider systemic risk as a conditional information variable to predict the underlying exposures to various asset market returns and risk factors. This study examines a proxy for global systemic risk employed by investment professionals known as the Treasury/Eurodollar (TED) spread. The findings reveal that increases in systemic risk causes some hedge fund investment styles to dynamically reduce their equity and stock momentum exposures while others increase their exposures to investment grade bonds and commodities.

The objectives of the present narrative review were to identify, summarize, and cluster all the potentially modifiable risk factors that influence the course of KOA, and discuss their susceptibility to alteration via personal, clinical, and public strategy. For this purpose, Pubmed and Scopus databases were queried using the terms ""knee osteoarthritis"", ""risk factors"" and ""improvement"". Six main categories of modifiable risk factors were identified: (1) obesity and overweight, (2) comorbidity, (3) occupational factors, (4) physical activity, (5) biomechanical factors, (6) dietary exposures. In the era of age- and obesity-related diseases, the combined effects of local and systemic risk factors should be managed by combined measures. Femoral muscle-strengthening physical activities, complemented with proper diet, weight loss, vocational rehabilitation, management of comorbidities (especially diabetes and depression), and biomechanical support may add up to the holistic therapeutic approach towards the patient with KOA. An individual risk factor modification program should be developed in accordance with patient preferences and habits, workplace, medical history, and overall health condition. Due to its great impact on a wide range of functions and tissues, interventions on modifiable risk factors improve not only the symptoms of KOA but also affect the osteoarthritic joint as a whole.",39,7,1145,1157,Systemic risk; Medical history; Psychological intervention; Disease management (health); Rehabilitation; Comorbidity; Overweight; Weight loss; Medicine; Gerontology,Biomechanics; Comorbidity; Diet; Disease management; Knee; Obesity; Occupational diseases; Osteoarthritis; Overweight; Rehabilitation; Risk factors,"Disease Management; Humans; Life Style; Obesity/complications; Occupations; Osteoarthritis, Knee/etiology; Risk Factors",,,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00296-019-04290-z https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911813 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30911813/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00296-019-04290-z,30911813,10.1007/s00296-019-04290-z,2924406088,,0,002-820-183-559-786; 003-069-791-619-867; 004-362-696-016-792; 005-241-560-614-449; 005-277-914-859-828; 005-785-583-888-018; 006-098-119-591-060; 006-699-267-983-588; 006-795-392-973-653; 006-953-345-221-222; 007-516-379-733-665; 008-325-918-290-176; 008-334-492-303-48X; 008-540-847-966-037; 008-566-000-886-993; 009-225-030-728-110; 009-619-451-112-674; 009-812-185-474-852; 010-709-867-672-071; 010-949-510-509-602; 011-190-823-614-759; 011-660-300-291-034; 012-192-737-295-11X; 012-447-602-809-795; 013-463-199-569-459; 014-265-178-617-051; 014-340-737-239-593; 016-273-506-271-727; 016-537-731-533-224; 018-697-411-417-780; 018-748-860-177-468; 019-348-108-161-111; 020-133-718-063-460; 022-413-966-020-717; 022-580-815-136-120; 022-937-551-219-203; 025-987-765-741-640; 025-993-006-897-389; 026-219-171-551-860; 026-898-791-065-246; 027-806-045-930-790; 028-772-196-670-061; 028-882-893-968-776; 029-860-575-059-373; 030-230-576-420-713; 030-599-118-228-580; 030-647-335-398-90X; 031-090-663-983-48X; 031-564-193-333-694; 031-688-087-924-276; 032-817-351-572-009; 033-503-667-801-378; 033-829-170-533-232; 034-657-219-181-070; 035-133-220-447-031; 035-359-421-250-675; 035-432-588-809-715; 036-244-577-013-509; 037-820-508-053-274; 037-999-969-966-706; 038-770-336-202-387; 039-861-674-642-799; 040-954-170-975-002; 041-912-139-742-391; 041-959-132-649-07X; 044-222-108-084-18X; 045-025-846-432-960; 045-155-378-661-206; 048-428-851-268-400; 050-604-946-396-52X; 050-690-914-300-267; 051-576-468-310-330; 051-593-605-673-299; 052-088-035-183-691; 052-290-094-608-361; 052-473-028-724-534; 052-712-239-402-063; 053-418-837-204-322; 053-826-836-486-842; 054-598-803-505-01X; 055-644-758-363-26X; 057-239-205-510-382; 058-199-376-239-315; 058-485-569-911-97X; 059-101-701-402-429; 059-558-508-873-616; 061-449-723-952-973; 061-497-824-611-701; 062-115-710-407-171; 062-847-161-242-16X; 063-087-874-912-706; 064-127-253-958-824; 066-147-223-454-394; 066-580-512-118-319; 069-355-775-337-554; 069-416-731-082-082; 071-159-612-552-376; 072-343-629-361-310; 074-378-710-944-997; 079-771-047-454-395; 079-780-334-027-77X; 080-129-403-401-618; 080-756-259-639-746; 081-253-900-092-355; 082-517-999-109-585; 082-525-595-643-175; 084-684-623-333-205; 086-906-330-867-16X; 087-407-834-263-263; 088-118-477-556-927; 093-791-622-654-111; 098-106-990-529-908; 107-394-693-362-594; 111-462-630-939-241; 113-819-776-215-782; 115-728-204-570-446; 117-248-311-671-082; 119-456-415-291-630; 130-605-945-223-170; 131-384-909-536-815; 136-206-773-929-897; 138-302-920-591-404; 144-258-513-344-360; 149-656-176-726-733; 155-181-974-469-488; 163-153-227-143-259; 176-575-839-220-800,72,False,,,lens

A good knowledge about the effect of these three variables towards the amount of lending by banks, which consists of three kinds: working capital loan, investment loan, and consumption loan, will help banks’ strategic plan to face the economic volatility. Bank is a financial institution that serves as a bridge between parties that have excess funds with parties that need some funds. Banks are expected to provide loans to the public to sustain economic growth with prudence to reduce the risks, which can be customer risks or systemic risks. The goal of this research is to study the effects and relationship between interest rates level, exchange rates movement, and export quantity towards the credit level of banks and also the three kinds of bank loans, which are the working capital loan, investment loan and consumer loan using historical data from Quarter I 2002 to Quarter III 2007. The result of research indicates that the macroeconomic variables above affect the amount of lending and the three kinds of loan: working capital loan, investment loan and consumer loan. The result also shows that although the three macroeconomic variables have the same influence towards the three kinds of loan, the magnitude of the influence towards each kind of loan is different, in which the investment loan has a big influence towards the interest rates level change, working capital loan has a big influence towards the export quantity and exchange rates, and consumer loan has a moderate influence towards the variation of the three macroeconomic variables.",1,1,166,192,Business; Term loan; Bridge loan; Non-conforming loan; Participation loan; Loan; Non-performing loan; Financial system; Loan sale; Fixed interest rate loan,,,,,https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/JAFA/article/view/121 http://myrahdika.ueuo.com/jurnal3/Pegaruh%20tingkat%20suku%20bunga.pdf https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/JAFA/article/download/121/117,http://dx.doi.org/10.21512/jafa.v1i1.121,,10.21512/jafa.v1i1.121,1546260202,,0,029-978-126-648-440; 066-507-814-223-906; 128-749-401-968-255,1,True,cc-by,hybrid,lens

Residences in the inner city are prone to be damaged by waterlogging hazards. This paper describes the risk analysis of rainstorm waterlogging on residences in Shanghai. First, a rainstorm scenario of 50-year return period was simulated with the rainstorm simulation model from Shanghai Flood Risk Information Center. Each residence was ranked according to its degree of exposure indicated by the inundation depth of that residence, and an exposure analysis model was then built. It is found from the exposure analysis that residences in the sub-districts like Linfen Road, Pengpu Village, Gonghe New Village, Hongqiao Road, Xianxia Road, Xinhua Road, and Zhenru Town are at high-exposure level. Whereas residences in other sub-districts like Gaojing Town, Siping Road, Huaihai Road, Yuyuan, Waitan, Caojiadu, Nanjing East Road, etc. are at low-exposure level. Second, given the characteristics of residences in waterlogging, the vulnerability of residences was expressed as the proportion of old-style residences to total residences. The results show that residences in Yuyuan, Xiaodongmen, Waitan, Nanjing East Road, Laoximen, Zhapu Road, North Station, and Tilanqiao are the most vulnerable ones, while there is no vulnerability in Fenglin Road, Kongjiang Road, Liangcheng New Village, Quyang Road, Siping Road, and Xianxia Road due to the absence of old-style residences. Finally, a model has been built from a systematic perspective and then waterlogging risk analysis was quantified by multiplying the exposure value with vulnerability value of residences. The results reveal that Laoximen, Tilanqiao, Dinghai Road, North Station, Tianping Road, Hongmei Road, Hunan Road, and Xiaodongmen are at high-risk level. The systemic risk model is a simple tool that can be used to assess the relative risk of waterlogging in different regions and the results of risk analysis are applicable to prevention and mitigation of waterlogging for Shanghai Municipal Government.",62,2,677,689,Risk analysis (engineering); Siping; Risk analysis (business); Vulnerability; Geography; Residence; Natural hazard; Flood myth; Return period; Waterlogging (agriculture),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:nathaz:v:62:y:2012:i:2:p:677-689 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11069-012-0099-3 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-012-0099-3/fulltext.html https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/nathaz/v62y2012i2p677-689.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11069-012-0099-3.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-012-0099-3,,10.1007/s11069-012-0099-3,2086354237,,0,001-940-626-249-18X; 019-455-085-625-422; 024-785-482-488-524; 044-967-788-678-999; 080-394-469-489-998; 080-891-700-215-453; 083-993-822-174-668; 117-877-742-853-728; 151-878-782-343-332; 158-913-195-368-477; 173-022-977-945-042,13,False,,,lens

Since the global financial crisis similar rules are being discussed by rule-makers all over the world, now however with various modifications. The German legislator has just decided on their introduction. Traditionally, such rules have been justified by considerations with regard to single financial institutions, but since the financial crisis the question of system stability has come to the fore. By no means has it been proven, however, that the separation of investment and commercial banking is able to reduce systemic risks. In addition, such a regime restricts institutional diversity and thus threatens to have destabilizing effects itself. The modifications which are currently being discussed as alternatives to the classical separate banking system cannot dispel these doubts. A restriction of activities based on the US-american Volcker Rule causes substantial problems with respect to identifying prohibited transactions. Moreover, it raises concerns about an increase in unregulated shadow banks. The intra-group separation of business lines which is planned and/or adopted on the European level, in Great Britain and Germany does not offer any promising leverage against systemic risk spreading: According to applicable corporate law, individual corporate affiliates are by no means entirely unconnected, but remain effectively integrated in a corporate group. Moreover, investor confidence in the entire group will be shaken even in case of difficulties of single divisions only. To sum up, the reservations against structural rules introducing a separate banking system are predominant, as such rules massively intervene in grown bank structures, at the same time being very complex, and for this reason posing the risk of circumvention as well as the risk of unintended side-effects. An incentive-based, more focused regulation of securities trading seems to constitute a much better alternative.",64,1,349,376,Systemic risk; Economics; Corporate law; Volcker Rule; Financial crisis; Legislator; Fencing; Financial system; Leverage (finance); Corporate group,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/ordojb/v64y2013i1p349-376n17.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bpj:ordojb:v:64:y:2013:i:1:p:349-376:n:17 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/bpjordojb/v_3a64_3ay_3a2013_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a349-376_3an_3a17.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ordo-2013-0117,,10.1515/ordo-2013-0117,2398320148,,0,,2,False,,,lens

The first paper overviews theoretical arguments for and against deposit insurance, a system that can be aimed at consumer protection and/or at financial stability. But deposit protection, by reducing risk, can cause "" moral hazard"" , in particular in relations to institutions potentially ""too-big-to-fail"" . The US and Japanese experiences with deposit insurance are useful lessons for Europe as they demonstrate how badly can market participants be affected by moral hazard. The second paper discusses lending of last resort in the Eurozone. The authors support the ECB's view that this function must be confined to play a minor role and that it must be handled with 'constructive ambiguity'. However, they think explicit decisions and a clear division of responsi-bilities are needed to ensure that its role is really minor and that the ambiguity is in fact constructive. They call for euro-wide standards of supervision and for the establishment of a 'European Observatory of Systemic Risk'. They also recommend "" prompt corrective action"" with the authorities ready to close banks before they become insolvent, if they do not comply with their instructions to keep high capital ratios. Read together the two papers offer useful insights into the current debate about how to make the financial infrastructure of Europe more robust.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Deposit insurance; Prompt Corrective Action; Constructive; Moral hazard; Capital requirement; Consumer protection; Insolvency,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/b/erf/erfstu/7.html,https://ideas.repec.org/b/erf/erfstu/7.html,,,3122497038,,0,,2,False,,,lens

Bridget Duffy,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare workers around the globe provided exceptional patient care despite fears of infection, shortages of staff and supplies, and the frustrations of trying to treat a novel pathogen. At the same time, COVID-19 exposed deep and systemic risks to healthcare team members' physical, psychological, and emotional safety driving burnout to crisis levels. Burnout is arising not only from the emotional toll of caring for sick and dying patients, but COVID-19 also exposed flaws in our health system and infrastructure. Systemic inequities were amplified as COVID-19 disproportionately impacted people of colour and Indigenous community members. A renewed and expanded definition of safety is needed to restore trust, recruit, and retain individuals to the healing professions, enable care to be provided with the greatest skill and humanity, and ensure the well-being of every person working in healthcare. In collaboration with CEOs of a diverse group of health systems in the United States, the author drafted a Declaration of Principles that expands the definition of safety to include safeguarding psychological and emotional well-being of team members, promoting health justice by declaring equity and anti-racism as core components of safety, and ensuring physical safety, which includes a zero-harm program to eliminate workplace violence, both physical and verbal. We invite Canadian leaders to embrace these concepts and commit to supporting team member safety and well-being as an essential foundation for public health.

Adopting the physics terminology, the supercooled Stefan problem is known to feature a finite-time blow-up of the freezing rate for a wide range of initial temperature distributions in the liquid. Such a blow-up can result in a discontinuity of the liquid-solid boundary. In this paper, we prove that the natural Euler time-stepping scheme applied to a probabilistic formulation of the supercooled Stefan problem converges to the liquid-solid boundary of its physical solution globally in time, in the Skorokhod M1 topology. In the course of the proof, we give an explicit bound on the rate of local convergence for the time-stepping scheme.

The proposed model adapts Gray, Merton and Bodie (2007) methodology to the characteristics of euro area countries. Based on sector balance sheets and assuming a totally marked to market shock transmission mechanism, our methodology consists in estimating all sets of shocks able to deplete the equity base of at least one sector. The probability of these shocks happening is then estimated. The methodology is applied to Portugal for the period between 2002 and 2010. We considered shocks in seven dimensions, notably, shocks in some sectors equity (nonfi nancial corporations, fi nancial institutions, insurance companies and the general government) and liabilities (non-fi nancial corporations, households). Shocks in households’ mortgages were distinguished from the remaining.

On aggregate, they appear to correctly value tangible assets but misprice intangible assets, with the possible exception of emerging market stocks. Investments in stakeholder capital—such as innovation, brand, and employees—often go unrecognized both on the balance sheet and by investors, despite their increased economic importance. In contrast, the premium paid for past acquisitions that is included on financial statements as goodwill generally fails to deliver on expectations, being written down too slowly by management and shareholders alike. These results are not explained by exposure to known systemic risk premia, limits to arbitrage, or data mining. Corroborating a recent surge of articles on this topic, we find that adjusting valuation metrics for the actual benefit of such intangibles improves performance in global equity markets. More impactfully, investors can diversify value exposure by targeting companies with latent such growth assets. Key Findings ▪ Historically, investors appear to have correctly valued tangible assets but mispriced intangible assets in developed global equity markets, overvaluing those recognized on the balance sheet, such as goodwill, but undervaluing the unreported “stakeholder capital” created from past spending on R&D, employees, and advertising. ▪ Adjusting valuation metrics to properly reflect the economic benefit of such intangible assets would consistently have improved their performance during our analysis period (1995–2020), even in emerging markets where the evidence for mispricing of companies’ assets mix was not statistically significant. ▪ Investors may also diversify value exposure by targeting companies with latent such growth assets, which outperformed even during the recent “quant winter” when most equity factor strategies and particularly value investing fared poorly.",31,2,60,74,Emerging markets; Business; Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Valuation (finance); Equity (finance); Goodwill; Limits to arbitrage; Value investing; Monetary economics,,,,,https://joi.pm-research.com/content/early/2021/10/06/joi.2021.1.204 http://joi.pm-research.com/content/early/2021/10/06/joi.2021.1.204,http://dx.doi.org/10.3905/joi.2021.1.204,,10.3905/joi.2021.1.204,3204196026,,0,002-006-438-937-237; 002-446-582-683-584; 003-089-261-327-929; 009-678-083-476-57X; 019-053-841-869-069; 022-806-504-881-659; 023-043-529-064-78X; 031-774-500-392-754; 033-647-750-042-803; 035-357-846-375-685; 041-217-228-717-900; 042-047-221-110-37X; 053-048-248-401-787; 053-742-136-421-310; 054-109-335-177-886; 055-491-671-683-944; 056-771-547-363-831; 062-505-484-414-384; 086-201-837-437-716; 087-159-011-576-998; 093-852-389-583-316; 106-745-841-341-142; 123-082-544-153-198; 142-765-754-165-519; 153-854-409-874-756; 181-084-198-494-020,0,False,,,lens

In order to assess this relationship, three papers in the format of journal articles were used to explore different theoretical concepts.; ; The first paper, is a systematic literature review of 4,859 abstracts to identify the different types of systemic risk measures and the challenges regulators face in addressing systemic risk. 56 measures of systemic risk developed post-2000 were identified and critically appraised to inform academics and regulators of the models' vulnerabilities. Additionally, a number of measures were calculated using US bank data. The findings of this paper suggests that the majority of these measures tend to focus on individual financial institutions' risk rather than the entire system stability. This directly reflects the current regulations, which aim to ensure individual institutions' soundness. As macro-prudential regulation evolves, policy-makers face the issues of understanding contagion and how such regulation should be implemented.; ; The second paper is an empirical analysis of banking cost efficiency, the aim of this paper is threefold, firstly to conduct an empirical literature review of banking sector efficiency over the last two decades, thereby identifying banking risk and regulatory variables used to access efficiency. Secondly, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) are applied to measure efficiency within the Basel jurisdiction's banks. Thirdly, it aims to investigate the determinates of cost efficiency in the US banks by employing System Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) regression analysis using panel data. This paper found the GMM analysis econometric measures of efficiency provided more statistically significant regression models than when using accounting based measures of efficiency. Also it was found that credit and liquidity risks are negatively associated with efficiency, and regulations designed to mitigate these risks have a negative impact on efficiency.; ; The final paper combines the literature and calculations from papers one and two, to examine the role of risk, regulation and efficiency within the banking competition and financial stability relationship. Using GMM regression, this paper found a neutral view of the competition-stability nexus within the US banking sector, where both competition and concentration fragility co-exist. In addition, a unique polynomial competition-fragility relationship was found. Interestingly using the Composite Index of Systemic Stress (CISS) as a measure of systemic risk, altered the competition-stability relationship to identify a concave relationship.; ; This suggests that the competition-stability nexus within one country can differ at the microeconomic (financial stability) and macroeconomic (systemic risk) level. In regards to increased risk, credit, leverage, diversification and liquidity risk was found to be negatively associated with financial stability. Whilst increased capital requirements as proposed by Basel III enhanced stability, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was unexpectedly found to hinder stability, providing caution to regulators as this is currently implemented.; ; The findings within this thesis provide an incentive for further academic research in the area of liquidity & systemic risk, which would be relevant to practitioners and policy-makers to enhance their understanding of banking competition and financial stability.",,,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Diversification (finance); Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Data envelopment analysis; Basel III; Capital requirement; Monetary economics; Leverage (finance),,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.779920 http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/39775/,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.779920,,,2964253165,,0,,0,False,,,lens

I study the implications of such lender default using a general equilibrium network model featuring endogenous leverage, endogenous asset prices, and endogenous network formation. The multiplex graph model has two channels of contagion: a counterparty channel of contagion and a price channel of contagion through endogenous collateral price. Borrowers diversify their lenders because of the counterparty risk, but they have to deal with lenders who lend at a higher margin. This diversification generates positive externalities by reducing systemic risk, but any decentralized equilibrium is constrained inefficient due to under-diversification. The key externalities here, arising from the tradeoff between counterparty risk and leverage (margin), are absent in models with exogenous leverage or exogenous networks. I use this framework to analyze the introduction of a central counterparty (CCP). I show that the loss coverage by the CCP reduces diversification incentives and exacerbates the externality problem which can rather increase systemic risk.",2019,083,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Diversification (finance); Financial networks; Collateral; Counterparty; Monetary economics; Leverage (finance); Collateralized debt obligation,,,,,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/collateralized-debt-networks-with-lender-default.htm https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3468267 https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019083pap.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedgfe/2019-83.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/feds.2019.083,,10.17016/feds.2019.083,2990386610,,0,003-446-183-637-341; 003-778-415-012-991; 003-803-424-332-155; 006-381-442-206-445; 009-248-782-454-29X; 010-495-987-702-553; 010-648-011-332-110; 015-824-920-982-286; 020-732-211-158-246; 022-404-239-527-189; 022-533-676-114-455; 026-046-227-276-595; 026-568-812-175-11X; 028-889-955-906-776; 029-652-108-487-444; 034-918-260-681-862; 035-110-399-338-182; 035-713-927-427-967; 041-354-194-466-859; 042-050-190-631-398; 046-784-280-003-764; 047-767-431-497-91X; 048-178-497-240-034; 048-297-576-911-977; 049-725-747-003-952; 053-014-679-119-593; 053-817-663-000-300; 054-909-517-727-91X; 057-009-805-315-309; 057-505-866-126-651; 059-702-419-892-923; 061-430-139-707-32X; 062-665-995-202-765; 063-329-652-421-660; 065-327-126-170-308; 070-902-062-917-749; 073-141-158-334-957; 075-049-436-397-255; 076-281-352-465-487; 076-609-100-910-595; 078-332-437-553-355; 078-964-547-449-925; 080-635-518-095-907; 088-149-451-347-256; 089-327-020-617-694; 089-566-792-311-810; 091-162-762-052-214; 091-384-088-522-133; 091-879-182-174-029; 091-898-133-968-854; 095-037-640-171-955; 100-357-765-287-160; 100-708-026-950-258; 106-840-243-371-267; 108-089-887-105-102; 108-411-153-476-417; 109-778-115-186-694; 115-756-664-037-296; 119-982-387-401-758; 122-257-427-382-448; 134-511-173-881-103; 137-403-587-899-62X; 138-007-378-625-464; 139-323-005-682-790; 143-121-438-185-334; 146-131-625-399-328; 162-860-694-546-993; 173-098-744-052-72X,0,True,,gold,lens

The factors were chosen from a wide range of accounting and market-based indicators, but also macroeconomic and financial development data, using a stepwise procedure. The study finds that financial development is one of the significant determinants of return co-movement but that the share of interbank activities in the balance sheet is not a significant factor. A strong link is found between the bank return co-movements and bank default risk measured by a z-score.

The edge weights in weighted networks often arise from aggregating some individual relationships between the nodes. Motivated by this, we introduce a modelling framework for weighted networks based on the compound Poisson distribution. To allow for heterogeneity between the nodes, we use a regression approach for the model parameters. We test the new modelling framework on two types of financial networks: a network of financial institutions in which the edge weights represent exposures from trading Credit Default Swaps and a network of countries in which the edge weights represent cross-border lending. The compound Poisson Gamma distributions with regression fit the data well in both situations. We illustrate how this modelling framework can be used for predicting unobserved edges and their weights in an only partially observed network.

175-230-892-336-212,"Mexico's Energy Regime Reforms: Rescission Risk, Mitigation, and Dispute Resolution",,2017.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Becky L. Jacobs; Brad Finney,"In July 2017, an international consortium of energy companies from the United States, Mexico, and the United Kingdom announced a significant crude oil discovery in shallow waters off the east coast of Mexico. This discovery is not only the fifth largest global oil discovery in the last five years and perhaps one of the top shallow-water fields discovered in the past twenty years, but, as “‘the first offshore exploration well drilled by the private sector in Mexico's history[,]”’ it has historical significance as well. This important find was made possible pursuant to recent landmark reforms to Mexico's energy legal regime that now allow foreign investors to participate in Mexico's energy sector. Prior to these reforms, Mexico's energy industry was among the most tightly controlled in the world, closely associated with national sovereignty. Indeed, many consider the Mexican petroleum expropriation of 1938 to be “the apogee of Mexican resource nationalism ... [and] a patriotic triumph” that is celebrated as Oil Expropriation Day, a national holiday, each March 18th. ; ; Resource nationalism, sometimes expressed in its extreme form as expropriation, is a systemic risk for private international oil companies. Given the historical precedent in Mexico for the use of expropriation within the energy sector, and with the recent upsurge in expropriations of foreign-owned oil assets in Bolivia, Ecuador, Russia, and Venezuela, the Mexican government's approach to dispute resolution was a critical factor for foreign investors eager to take advantage of the Mexican energy reforms. While the reform package does authorize parties to exploration and production (E&P) contracts to agree upon alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration, it also contains a controversial unilateral rescission exception that could greatly impact foreign investors ; ; This article will briefly review the history of oil production in Mexico and the governing legal regime in Part I, and in Part II, the recent reforms to that regime thereto. Part III will consider the reform's dispute resolution provisions and administrative rescission. Part IV will offer possible mechanisms by which foreign investors might mitigate the risk of administrative rescission to protect their investment in the Mexican energy sector. The final reflections of this article will focus upon the status and current success of Mexico's attempts to attract large international companies to invest significant amounts of capital and assets into Mexico's energy industry, despite concerns related to unilateral rescission.",,,,,Private sector; Dispute resolution; Alternative dispute resolution; International trade; Arbitration; Political science; Sovereignty; Resource nationalism; Expropriation; Rescission,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3813508,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3813508,,,3156952383,,0,,0,False,,,lens

An extraction of default factors from cross-sectional credit default swaps (CDS) curves allows to analyze the shape and the dynamics of the default probabilities. Extending the Dynamic Nelson Siegel (DNS) model, we propose a network DNS model to analyze the interconnectedness of default factors in a dynamic fashion, and forecast the CDS curves. The extracted level factors representing long-term default risk demonstrate 85.5% total connectedness, while the slope and the curvature factors document 79.72% and 62.94% total connectedness for the short-term and middle-term default risk, respectively. The issues of default spillover and systemic risk should be weighted for the market participants with longer credit exposures, and for regulators with a mission to stabilize financial markets. The US banks contribute more to the long-run default spillover before 2012, whereas the European banks are major default transmitters during and after the European debt crisis either in the long-run or short-run. The outperformance of the network DNS model indicates that the prediction on CDS curve requires network information.",,,,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Financial market; Social connectedness; Credit default swap; Risk management; Computer science; European debt crisis; Spillover effect; Variance decomposition of forecast errors,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2892551 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2892551_code545.pdf?abstractid=2892551&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2892551_code545.pdf?abstractid=2892551&mirid=1&type=2 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2892551,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2892551,,10.2139/ssrn.2892551,3123545946,,0,001-555-214-620-068; 013-803-144-182-159; 028-575-722-653-817; 033-253-448-872-927; 037-302-681-180-533; 048-069-541-592-457; 048-580-836-133-280; 051-976-023-337-197; 052-925-509-494-623; 056-746-278-414-666; 068-530-341-607-595; 076-571-098-781-737; 077-585-316-150-700; 084-390-264-229-786; 087-596-857-004-964; 090-924-324-763-384; 093-376-879-356-971; 095-166-217-041-222; 109-679-167-832-682; 115-806-665-215-624; 119-031-570-848-300; 157-043-806-296-597; 158-407-681-852-676,2,True,,green,lens

This paper develops a model of securitization and financial stability in the form of amplification effects. This model has illustrated three different scenarios: A negative shock in the economy will lead to downturn of the economy and falling of the asset prices, deteriorating balance sheets and tightening financing conditions. However, if there is no shock or a positive shock, banks can improve its profitability significantly through securitization. While securitization decreases the probability of systemic crisis, banks tend to suffer more when the crisis happens as a result of over-borrowing and over-investing. This paper uses a three-period theoretical model to demonstrate the impact of securitization on the financial stability, and provides clear analytical guidelines for a new regulatory framework of securitization that account for systemic risk and systemic externalities.",,,,,Profitability index; Systemic risk; Economics; Balance sheet; Asset (economics); Financial crisis; Securitization; Shock (economics); Monetary economics; Default,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:35000,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pra:mprapa:35000,,,3148371314,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Policymakers should take several steps now to avert this chain of events.Since the financial crisis of 2007/08, policymakers have focused on systemic risk to financial and economic systems, with most of the attention on the banking system. The framework for these efforts has been to build resiliency and shock absorbers to minimize the impact of financial shocks on the real economy. The inevitability of an earthquake in Canada poses a similar systemic financial risk for the insurance industry and the economy as a whole, and similar remedial efforts are required.A federal emergency backstop arrangement for property and casualty insurers, properly designed, would minimize the systemic financial impact resulting from such a catastrophic and likely uninsurable event on those affected and on the economy at large. The moral-hazard implications appear small compared to the benefits of avoiding serious systemic risk. The backstop arrangement should, however, apportion costs, including a possible tranche of further contingent risk-sharing with industry in a way that lessens moral hazard issues. A federal last-resort backstop guarantee could kick in beyond an industry-wide trigger of expected losses, say those associated with a one-in-500-year earthquake – currently approximately $30 billion to $35 billion. This loss estimate would be updated periodically, and the trigger could be set somewhere in excess of the one-in-500 threshold to promote further industry risk-sharing.That said, as part of any Canadian reform package, it is important to bolster the Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation to deal with insurance industry problems and reduce systemic impacts from severe catastrophes. This would also reduce the likelihood that a federal financial commitment would be triggered and, if triggered, would have minimum costs. Having more tools available in advance to deal with catastrophic events would reduce post-catastrophe disaster claims. This Commentary recommends the following:• Strengthen PACCIC so it can intervene before insurance companies in financial difficulty become insolvent.• Ensure PACCIC has the capability to borrow to reduce its liquidity needs in a crisis.• Following these structural changes, PACCIC should rerun its scenario models to examine how much that could increase resilience to extreme events.Furthermore, insurance industry bodies, as well as the federal and provincial governments, should undertake awareness programs to enhance homeowners’ understanding of catastrophe risks. This should encourage Canadians to evaluate the merits of disaster insurance coverage, particularly in the Quebec City-Montreal-Ottawa corridor where such insurance penetration is far too low. Finally, the insurance industry, under active OSFI supervision, should further develop its models for setting aside adequate capital and claims-paying capacity. Regulators should ensure there is an adequate degree of conservatism and that models are as up to date as possible. OSFI should regularly assess the adequacy of major insurers’ models, as they have done in the banking industry.",,,,,General insurance; Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Casualty insurance; Key person insurance; Property insurance; Auto insurance risk selection; Financial risk; Risk pool,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2817911 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2817911,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2817911,,10.2139/ssrn.2817911,2519278871,,0,017-219-781-994-427; 028-301-743-597-246; 053-547-278-367-547; 053-661-164-340-812; 057-520-502-561-746; 089-043-464-175-714; 107-917-794-738-298; 126-863-007-231-702,2,True,,green,lens

These so called “globally networked risks” pose fundamental challenges to global governance institutions. A growing literature explores the nature of these globally networked or “systemic” risks. While this research has taught us much about the anatomy of these risks, it has consistently failed to integrate insights from the wider social sciences. This is problematic since the prescriptions that result from these efforts flow from naїve assumptions about the way real-world state and non-state actors behave in the international arena. This leaves serious gaps in our understanding of whether networked environmental risks at all can be governed. The following essay brings together decades of research by different disciplines in the social sciences, and identifies five multi-disciplinary key insights that can inform global approaches to governing these. These insights include the influence of international institutions; the dynamics and effect of international norms and legal mechanisms; the need for international institutions to cope with transboundary and cross-sectoral crises; the role of innovation as a strategy to handle unpredictable global risks; and the necessity to address legitimacy issues.",8,1,4,27,Systemic risk; Political science; Environmental degradation; Global governance; State (polity); Water security; Corporate governance; Public relations; Legitimacy; Economic growth; Food security,,,,Stiftelsen för Miljöstrategisk Forskning,https://core.ac.uk/display/154413835 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1093886 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rhc3.12108/full https://repub.eur.nl/pub/98877 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rhc3.12108 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173266946?q=(similar%3a20103018392) https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A98877 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rhc3.12108/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rhc3.12108,,10.1002/rhc3.12108,2595696630,,0,000-058-692-193-925; 000-757-132-419-829; 002-888-714-873-784; 003-064-271-530-25X; 003-178-454-028-620; 006-100-320-010-045; 006-970-742-968-308; 009-423-346-615-304; 009-630-298-136-158; 010-758-637-700-322; 011-280-791-239-008; 012-231-545-033-325; 013-646-789-959-336; 013-876-610-453-372; 015-801-648-902-387; 017-446-705-491-684; 017-642-661-781-097; 018-497-730-213-957; 021-148-880-699-326; 024-780-864-954-022; 025-205-107-207-295; 025-275-165-770-872; 025-289-306-867-975; 026-142-858-524-874; 028-343-557-820-227; 030-239-260-245-032; 030-715-194-755-783; 031-095-052-208-567; 031-413-862-642-294; 033-395-469-155-293; 034-294-469-942-012; 034-374-409-241-337; 034-983-912-613-891; 037-644-983-685-879; 038-550-821-926-480; 039-575-666-245-294; 043-204-629-382-187; 043-356-716-128-729; 044-758-375-640-668; 046-069-557-234-205; 047-018-804-530-631; 047-812-993-541-791; 048-084-385-775-90X; 050-739-501-621-243; 050-944-090-852-76X; 051-564-024-635-830; 051-587-341-668-339; 052-336-963-263-74X; 052-802-334-885-429; 053-660-021-597-544; 055-657-062-699-163; 056-107-815-685-496; 058-280-966-849-63X; 060-443-388-435-798; 062-510-573-122-320; 062-801-732-122-193; 064-032-964-355-77X; 066-267-814-565-607; 067-411-940-839-437; 067-858-238-034-39X; 068-188-284-568-84X; 068-414-692-577-14X; 068-815-480-625-514; 069-665-375-993-716; 070-061-271-729-185; 071-350-994-639-279; 072-068-590-302-298; 074-697-205-283-348; 075-360-971-486-50X; 075-825-277-101-347; 076-599-362-366-618; 078-126-789-565-395; 078-788-412-127-582; 080-645-944-383-150; 081-602-765-196-954; 083-048-751-333-134; 088-021-253-053-414; 090-624-013-099-098; 092-163-899-683-456; 092-817-037-080-352; 092-990-047-547-015; 093-785-128-653-358; 094-384-408-798-278; 096-169-731-559-884; 098-205-250-432-119; 098-943-445-133-009; 098-988-615-716-506; 100-574-005-309-268; 101-718-384-812-950; 102-292-887-918-977; 105-617-887-162-075; 108-005-867-068-008; 113-170-417-325-281; 121-549-401-781-414; 122-444-237-358-088; 123-056-712-826-453; 124-440-811-722-10X; 126-035-123-658-144; 129-760-519-856-666; 131-195-674-198-870; 134-716-971-543-933; 137-740-262-623-307; 140-926-535-837-946; 143-395-053-480-445; 145-622-230-339-398; 149-692-155-166-587; 152-420-018-160-719; 154-310-961-062-920; 166-653-993-755-414; 169-533-246-284-666; 169-684-234-977-818; 174-399-704-136-318; 186-521-213-702-786; 198-508-032-873-93X,43,False,,,lens

Clinton; Tsonwin Hai; Daehee Hwang; Keith R. Solomon; Michael R. Freeman,"Elevated circulating cholesterol is a systemic risk factor for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, however the manner in which the normal prostate responds to variations in cholesterol levels is poorly understood. In this study we addressed the molecular and cellular effects of elevated and suppressed levels of circulating cholesterol on the normal prostate. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was performed using DNA microarray data from two experimental formats: (1) ventral prostate from male mice with chronically elevated circulating cholesterol and (2) human prostate cells exposed acutely to cholesterol depletion. A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels. These findings open new perspectives on the role of cholesterol in prostate health, and provide a novel role for ATF3, and associated proteins within a large signaling network, as a cholesterol-sensing mechanism.",7,7,e39448,,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Liver X receptor; Adipose tissue; Gene expression profiling; Prostate; Cholesterol; Prostate cancer; Nerve tract; Medicine; Activating transcription factor,,"Activating Transcription Factor 3/biosynthesis; Adipose Tissue/metabolism; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cholesterol/blood; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, SCID; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods; Prostate/metabolism; Signal Transduction/physiology","ATF3 protein, human; Activating Transcription Factor 3; Atf3 protein, mouse; Cholesterol",NCI NIH HHS (R01 CA143777) United States; NIDDK NIH HHS (R01 DK087806) United States; NIDDK NIH HHS (P50 DK65298) United States; NCI NIH HHS (K99 CA131472) United States; NCI NIH HHS (R01 CA101046) United States; NIDDK NIH HHS (P50 DK065298) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22768301 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10464970/3388073.pdf?sequence=1 https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10464970 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039448&type=printable http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039448 https://oasis.postech.ac.kr/handle/2014.oak/12671 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/annotation/b77e9022-f87c-4f77-9f82-9072351e3360 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/10464970/1/3388073.pdf https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3436931,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039448,22768301,10.1371/journal.pone.0039448,2156445049,PMC3388073,0,002-800-756-675-437; 004-285-750-974-806; 004-860-760-965-725; 007-814-172-491-764; 008-602-891-203-02X; 010-201-595-633-724; 014-138-949-358-210; 014-375-234-172-999; 015-215-154-225-206; 016-070-439-124-064; 016-777-618-604-10X; 017-901-637-978-790; 018-398-158-554-246; 018-797-073-427-377; 019-843-113-718-672; 020-761-857-580-932; 022-484-452-738-762; 024-131-059-302-937; 027-767-462-708-235; 028-254-775-366-849; 033-231-373-517-172; 034-369-311-955-706; 039-000-387-053-479; 041-064-920-194-670; 043-306-416-057-185; 045-288-021-133-258; 049-490-425-567-698; 050-310-635-926-446; 052-287-402-049-817; 055-783-398-282-043; 056-466-595-311-760; 057-709-792-172-333; 059-909-520-656-624; 060-324-704-113-853; 060-411-938-822-332; 062-244-887-867-924; 063-806-128-407-271; 065-560-767-606-731; 071-029-451-373-610; 071-201-754-289-696; 073-861-907-338-572; 079-315-830-081-931; 079-823-811-948-924; 080-066-406-800-336; 081-987-409-839-378; 088-064-600-604-656; 097-411-034-279-800; 098-245-561-526-725; 099-586-934-992-879; 102-619-006-500-434; 105-516-421-714-445; 107-915-487-444-848; 112-583-257-756-996; 124-252-393-324-783; 126-411-766-199-435; 153-309-948-514-393; 153-909-924-276-764,9,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Reboredo; Andrea Ugolini,"ABSTACTWe measured the systemic impact of financial distress in a Spanish listed bank on other listed banks and on the European financial system, using conditional value at risk (CoVaR) as a systemic risk measure. We modelled multivariate dependence between listed banks using a hierarchical tree structure given by a vine copula model and, using bivariate copulas, dependence between listed banks and the European financial system. For the period January 2003 to March 2015, systemic risk dramatically increased around the time of the recent global financial crisis and, to a lesser extent, around the time of the European debt crisis. BBVA played a predominant role as it both transmitted and received systemic risk to and from the remaining listed banks. Santander played a minor role and the smallest banks, Sabadell and Bankinter, did not play any pivotal role, not even between themselves. Finally, the main systemic impact of the Spanish banks on the European financial systems originated in BBVA, Popular and San...",45,1,1,31,Financial economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial crisis; Vine copula; Financial distress; European debt crisis; Expected shortfall; Bivariate analysis; Financial system,,,,Gobierno de Italia; Xunta de Galicia and FEDER,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5378778 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02102412.2015.1092231 https://boa.unimib.it/handle/10281/334017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02102412.2015.1092231,,10.1080/02102412.2015.1092231,2261257784,,0,001-274-723-652-948; 003-467-629-451-027; 003-764-918-466-699; 004-193-902-378-854; 010-343-664-389-328; 012-525-456-033-239; 012-576-236-010-721; 017-486-496-247-162; 031-686-086-871-820; 034-565-642-362-436; 035-702-358-530-601; 037-596-603-345-722; 043-198-095-708-796; 048-363-026-036-293; 057-774-599-082-767; 072-288-201-757-761; 074-170-580-336-674; 080-290-057-661-062; 094-836-682-333-662; 096-306-267-703-00X; 108-394-016-800-215; 121-714-363-995-599; 131-129-323-128-701; 145-556-947-490-068; 161-388-814-416-825; 168-422-163-339-942; 171-795-063-524-809; 181-329-947-787-756,7,False,,,lens

The purpose of the article is to identify the specifics of the adaptation of the elite and its political regime to the conditions of modern network communications. Based on the analysis of specialized literature, an intermediate conclusion is made – a functional approach, as a synthesis of structurally oriented and process-oriented aspects of the study of the political regime, becomes the most optimal analytical lens in the study of network communications. Based on the analysis of specialized literature, an intermediate conclusion is made – a functional approach, as a synthesis of structurally-oriented and process-oriented aspects of the study of the political regime, becomes the most optimal analytical lens in the study of network communications. The author's hypothesis is the assumption that the activity of representatives of the political elite in network communications poses serious risks for maintaining the democratic foundation of political regimes. To test the hypothesis, the methodological optics of quantitative content analysis was chosen. The classification of political regimes proposed by the authors of the Swedish scientific project Regimes of the World (RoW) is considered. In a study of the political communities of network communications, it was found that despite the existence of different types of political regimes, there is a general pattern – the predominance of large communities of political leaders. At the same time, communities of parliaments and courts are mostly less popular. This phenomenon is associated by the author with the systemic risks of democracy – the effect of «technological overlap» and the growth of populism. It is emphasized that the legitimization of the political regime in many respects already occurs with the active adaptation of the political elite to the digitalization process. In the framework of the «Network Polis» model, the discussion problems of combining democracy and virtual network communities are considered.</jats:p>",4,1,70,83,Political economy; Political science; Elite; Politics,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.12737/2587-6295-2020-70-83,http://dx.doi.org/10.12737/2587-6295-2020-70-83,,10.12737/2587-6295-2020-70-83,3013490264,,0,007-082-779-399-680; 008-902-117-317-161; 012-883-810-437-843; 013-785-186-991-222; 015-012-252-269-675; 020-796-083-014-282; 026-260-553-763-935; 035-520-006-675-666; 035-749-966-781-605; 049-580-250-301-271; 065-736-915-534-44X; 075-500-382-830-853; 080-008-710-039-97X; 086-220-243-754-603; 114-390-320-371-696; 120-460-324-097-805; 148-183-734-495-068; 151-104-141-215-040; 151-638-066-395-26X; 155-015-452-703-798; 162-415-263-848-564; 172-617-856-306-515; 174-467-575-707-875; 196-645-462-460-623,3,True,,bronze,lens

This paper proposes an extension of the so-called CoVaR measure that captures the asymmetric response of the banking system to positive and negative shocks to the market-valued balance sheets of individual banks. For the median of our sample of U.S. banks, the relative impact on the system of a fall in individual market value is sevenfold that of an increase. Moreover, the downward bias in systemic risk from ignoring this asymmetric pattern increases with bank size. The conditional tail comovement between the banking system and a top decile bank which is losing market value is 5.4 larger than the unconditional tail comovement versus only 2.2 for banks in the bottom decile. The asymmetric model also produces much better estimates and fitting, and thus improves the capacity to monitor systemic risk. Our results suggest that ignoring asymmetries in tail interdependence may lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk in a downward market.",12,152,i,,Systemic risk; Decile; Econometrics; Economics; Market value; Downside risk; Risk management; Bond; Financial risk; Value at risk,,,,,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2012/_wp12152.ashx https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Systemic-Risk-and-Asymmetric-Responses-in-the-Financial-Industry-25991 https://ideas.repec.org/p/imf/imfwpa/2012-152.html https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2012/152/article-A001-en.xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.5089/9781475504347.001,,10.5089/9781475504347.001,2956103472,,0,006-491-472-590-553; 007-398-058-153-868; 008-141-706-882-827; 011-097-819-727-797; 011-379-035-454-052; 013-206-942-213-532; 015-417-351-678-250; 016-375-129-358-33X; 017-486-496-247-162; 018-319-503-191-59X; 021-172-045-260-061; 029-030-072-027-094; 035-104-934-704-682; 037-122-689-375-425; 041-171-756-982-790; 064-974-266-523-480; 066-891-755-703-211; 071-170-313-330-172; 077-175-145-802-759; 090-566-436-554-926; 121-523-251-324-502; 130-845-952-579-442; 132-241-624-705-273; 161-388-814-416-825; 181-953-131-517-867; 198-831-686-707-017,11,False,,,lens

The current short-termism of most companies suggests the importance of raising awareness among the private sector about the potential risks of climate change. However, companies increasingly are reporting and disclosing climate risks and associated costs as asked for benchmarking by financial institutions and to comply with regulations with respect to sustainable finance. A guidance on how to do a climate risk assessment and to estimate the costs of physical climate risk as well as transitional and systemic risk concerning their operations and value chain management is lacking.

125-994-727-983-754,Sociodemographic variables associated with risk for diabetic retinopathy,2022-05-04,2022.0,preprint,,,Research Square Platform LLC,,Chan Tran N Nguyen; Matheos Yosef; Shokoufeh Khalatbari; Anjali R Shah,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>;         <jats:p>Background;  Several systemic and sociodemographic factors have been associated with the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, there is limited investigation of the potential role social determinants of health may play in augmenting systemic risk factors of DR. This single-center retrospective study aims to identify the association between certain sociodemographic factors and systemic risk factors for developing DR and to assess the impact of these factors on the development of vision-threatening forms of DR (VT-DR).; Methods;  Multivariable analysis of longitudinal electronic health record data at a large academic retina clinic was performed. Sociodemographic factors included race, ethnicity, income, and insurance payor. Systemic risk factors for DR included hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), systolic blood pressure (sBP), and body mass index (BMI). VT-DR was identified from encounter diagnostic codes indicating proliferative retinopathy or diabetic macular edema. Patient-reported primary address zip codes were used to approximate income level, stratified into quartiles.; Results;  From 2016 to 2018, 3,470 patients with diabetes totaled 11,437 visits were identified. Black patients had higher HgbA1c and sBP compared to White patients. White patients had higher BMI and sBP compared to patients of unknown/other race and greater odds of VT-DR than the latter. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity had significantly higher sBP than non-Hispanic patients. Low-income patients had higher BMI and sBP than high-income patients and greater odds of VT-DR than the latter. Medicaid recipients had greater odds of VT-DR than those with Blue Care Network (BCN) and Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) insurance. Medicaid and Medicare recipients had higher sBP compared to BCBS recipients. Finally, both higher HgbA1c and sBP had greater odds of VT-DR. There were no differences in odds of VT-DR between White and Black patients or between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.; Conclusions;  Significant associations exist between certain sociodemographic factors and well-known risk factors for DR. Income and payor were associated with increased severity of systemic risk factors and presence of VT-DR. This warrants further investigation of how risk factor optimization and disease prevention may be further improved by targeted intervention of these modifiable sociodemographic factors.</jats:p>",,,,,Medicine; Body mass index; Odds ratio; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic retinopathy; Odds; Medicaid; Internal medicine; Ethnic group; Quartile; Demography; Gerontology; Health care; Logistic regression; Confidence interval; Endocrinology; Sociology; Economic growth; Anthropology; Economics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1611608/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-1611608/v1,,,0,,0,True,,green,lens

With growing digitalization and quickening of transfer speed, information exchange in the individual involvement to break trends online on a global scale may impose unknown systemic risks in causing social volatility in international economics. Research may explore how human beings’ communication and interaction results in socially constructed volatility that echoes in economic correlates. This paper proposes to explore the role of communication and temporal foci in pandemic communication to create social volatility underlying economic downturns with attention to international differences. Comparing the economic consequence of the endogenous crunch of the 2008 World Financial Recession with the external economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic could aid to retrieve crisis-specific recovery recommendations.

Especially in these days of great uncertainty, war conflicts, and systemic risks that may arise, it is vital to clarify what techniques will be used in the storage of ICH to ensure its unhindered preservation and dissemination over time across the globe. Using the systems thinking approach indicated for cases of great complexity, the process followed in Greece for depositing a new element in its local repository is described to demonstrate the need for a well-defined process by UNESCO, which must be followed worldwide, and which has not been defined so far. What are the potential challenges not only in determining the type of data, but also in choosing the best metadata model to use in each case when capturing these data? What technologies must be used for storing digital cultural heritage in such a way that will preserve it over time, defying physical and technological hazards? This article finally suggests how blockchain technologies (BT) can be effectively used to store the global ICH and ensure its continuity in future generations by creating a decentralized worldwide network between the heritage stakeholders.</jats:p>",6,3,3232,3255,Metadata; Safeguarding; Cultural heritage; Intangible cultural heritage; Globe; Process (computing); Big data; Blockchain; Business; Cataloging; Computer science; Data science; Political science; World Wide Web; Computer security; Law; Medicine; Nursing; Ophthalmology; Operating system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/heritage6030171,,10.3390/heritage6030171,,,0,006-131-603-403-086; 033-220-480-327-311; 074-540-362-649-352; 093-426-742-726-743; 116-442-645-519-868; 165-802-802-116-477,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Evidence suggests that short sellers sold short stocks that had the greatest asset and insolvency risk exposures, and that the short selling of financial firms’ stocks was not significantly greater than that of non-financial firms after we match them on firm size and insolvency risk. When the short ban was in effect, the market quality of financial stocks without subprime assets exposure had deteriorated to a larger degree than that of financial companies with subprime assets exposure.

However, consistent with ""group-think"" concerns, we find that the more central banks in the network contribute significantly to the systemic risk of the global banking system, suggesting there may also be a downside to having a strong social network.",,,,,Variety (cybernetics); Business; Systemic risk; Construct (philosophy); Syndicated loan; Financial crisis; Bank regulation; Banking sector; Financial system; Social network,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2686389_code826838.pdf?abstractid=2288134&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2288134 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2686389_code826838.pdf?abstractid=2288134&mirid=1&type=2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2288134,,,1518503677,,0,000-268-632-434-737; 010-870-033-690-581; 019-916-895-243-927; 028-470-416-713-278; 033-072-514-987-085; 033-194-136-964-980; 034-666-957-339-946; 035-940-976-635-623; 040-236-236-452-129; 042-780-798-255-794; 044-263-632-575-63X; 045-354-948-089-38X; 047-225-364-647-845; 051-411-707-535-030; 052-578-585-801-388; 052-755-488-687-151; 059-138-276-797-691; 064-918-277-007-696; 073-660-459-427-772; 079-599-008-907-302; 084-890-077-558-956; 085-016-696-223-878; 092-282-143-008-428; 096-783-722-463-215; 108-528-259-935-705; 117-937-216-345-768; 123-256-636-714-850; 125-895-615-947-181; 132-147-087-429-187; 134-567-660-232-728; 138-911-265-403-545; 149-182-877-918-971; 169-914-689-235-504; 185-985-007-338-097; 193-282-903-656-21X; 196-085-951-185-64X,3,False,,,lens

To this end we analyse both the economic benefits and the costs stemming from investment banking. The study focuses on investment banks as this part of banking is particularly relevant for financing companies as well as the development and use of specific products to support the needs of private and professional clients. The assessment of benefits and costs of investment banking has been conducted from a European perspective. Nevertheless there is a focus on the German economy to allow a more detailed analysis of certain aspects as for example the use of derivatives by German companies, the success of M&As in Germany or the effect of securitization on loan supply and GDP in Germany. For comparison purposes other European countries and also the U.S. have been taken into account. The last financial crisis has shown the negative impacts of banks on the financial system and the whole economy. In a study on the contribution of investment banks to systemic risk we quantify the negative side of the investment banking business. In the last part of the study we assess how the effects of regulatory changes on investment banking. All important changes in banking and capital market regulation are taken into account such as Basel III, additional capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions, regulation of OTC derivatives and specific taxes.",,,,,Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Investment banking; Loan; Financial crisis; Basel III; Securitization; Capital requirement; Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:zewdok:1201,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:zewdok:1201,,,3125465409,,0,,0,False,,,lens
027-656-697-628-22X,The Spillover of Systemic Ethical Behaviour.,,2010.0,,,,,,Alejandro Canadas,"The current financial crisis not only brought us high levels of unemployment, abrupt international disruption in economic growth, disinflation of assets prices and a dry up in the credit markets, among many other things; but it also brought us a crisis in the theory of economics and finance. Even though, a discussion concerning ―a crisis in the theory of finance‖ seems very interesting, it will miss the point. The real crisis is an ―ethical crisis‖ that involves all the economic subjects that utilize any financial theory. The paper argues that the current financial crisis is a result of a spillover of systemic ethical behaviour that replicates the systemic risk of a financial system. In the international financial system, banks, as well as human beings, copy other banks; they expose themselves to similar risks by making the same type of decisions. Similarly, economic agents, who are human beings, emulate other economic agents by making similar economic decisions. What is safe for one economic agent becomes dangerous if all of them do the same thing, which is even more problematic when those financial decisions are ethically questionable. The paper argues that to solve future financial crises the role of the university is essential. Universities should highlight the importance of ethical responsibility in any human field, especially in economics and finance.",2010,3,,,Systemic risk; Discount points; Political science; Unemployment; Financial crisis; Disinflation; Field (Bourdieu); Economic agents; Market economy; Spillover effect; Economic system,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ903940 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ903940.pdf http://forumonpublicpolicy.com/spring2010.vol2010/spring2010archive/canadas.pdf,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ903940,,,328290300,,0,001-902-806-501-891; 001-939-765-083-863; 003-877-724-775-187; 008-229-774-203-116; 011-631-702-743-256; 015-004-986-148-864; 015-637-085-897-243; 019-739-760-807-68X; 020-239-919-471-968; 021-676-696-970-20X; 034-349-370-653-582; 037-539-811-599-777; 050-849-474-729-845; 059-087-393-942-782; 059-447-587-521-245; 062-938-103-637-028; 066-151-301-327-510; 066-922-859-214-884; 069-405-622-489-787; 071-918-325-951-635; 072-779-164-090-553; 079-574-486-051-691; 079-927-381-186-574; 080-414-159-946-335; 086-745-058-530-765; 097-510-655-983-597; 099-816-647-362-71X; 102-814-330-927-564; 108-154-160-288-997; 111-597-016-772-777; 113-768-501-700-036; 124-246-733-740-898; 132-534-719-332-720; 143-579-860-329-844; 152-851-776-416-255; 165-041-314-038-138; 166-728-588-515-816; 170-851-664-310-256; 187-946-569-544-07X; 190-032-990-340-879,0,False,,,lens

The paper focuses on a system characterized by high concentration and low total number of banks. Each issue is addressed separately. The first section discusses best practices in deposit insurance design and derives conclusions for the case we are interested in. One is that in this context deposit insurance cannot be thought of as a stand-alone instrument, but rather must be understood as an element of the intervention and resolution policy. The second part of the paper studies systemic risk in such a system, using the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) approach to model and study risk in a network of banks. A working metric of the “too big to fail” situation can be derived in the model. More importantly, this section shows how the risk of idiosyncratic shocks spreading through the system are substantially higher in concentrated systems than in decentralized ones. Finally, the paper proposes and evaluates a specific regulatory measure that successfully contains systemic risk.",7,,359,385,Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Metric (unit); Best practice; Deposit insurance; Safety net; Context (language use); Too big to fail; Intervention (law),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/chb/bcchwp/231.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:chb:bcchsb:v07c13pp359-385 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/964810.pdf,https://ideas.repec.org/p/chb/bcchwp/231.html,,,1581023707,,0,009-891-534-271-286; 026-277-648-555-398; 033-237-018-677-814; 037-000-649-895-56X; 045-217-294-804-688; 053-992-943-857-702; 073-630-436-087-181; 088-149-451-347-256; 094-668-294-420-879; 139-241-729-000-32X; 150-347-168-528-987; 152-501-222-860-434; 182-333-178-880-152; 182-401-964-998-619,1,False,,,lens

It is the VaR (Value at Risk) of the system (represented as a broad market index) conditional to the fact that a certain institution is in distress (i.e. at its VaR). One of the limits of CoVaR is that it does not consider the relations among institutions in the system, failing to represent interconnectedness, that is a relevant component of systemic risk. Instead, it reflects more the systematic component of risk, that is, the one related to a common component. A popular approach to analyze interconnectedness is to consider an economic system as a network. In this work we deal with network-DeltaCoVaR, a multivariate extension of DeltaCoVaR, that measures the marginal tail dependence among institutions while controlling for the effects of the others. We discuss the properties of the model and we propose an estimation methodology based on quantile regression with Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) penalty. Finally, we use these tail risk networks to develop systemic risk indicators and to study the characteristic of the European banking system and its evolution over time.",,,550,557,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Tail risk; Tail dependence; Component (UML); Quantile regression; Stock market index; Interconnectedness; Value at risk,,,,,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/151546,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/151546,,,3021986829,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Castellano,"The growing interconnections between people, markets and networks together with the development of new technologies have increased the frequency and impact of large-scale disasters around the globe. Many of these events, defined as emerging catastrophic (or systemic) risks, have no previous record. At the same time there is a strong probability that their frequency and impact will increase in the future. This paper takes a governance perspective by assuming that policy actions should be designed to cope with ignorance and large-scale losses, being the primary features characterising such emerging catastrophic risks. Precisely, the governance activity should aim both at expanding the industries’ capacity to absorb losses and at acquiring more information about frequency and impact of such losses. However, it appears that some solutions may conflict with policy objectives. In particular, direct governmental interventions to compensate victims and stringent antitrust policy goals might block the development of a market for first-party property insurance for emerging systemic risks. This paper elicits crucial points that require further elaboration by policy-makers, thereby stressing the importance of providing a workable legal definition of such line of risk that embraces the precautionary principle.",35,3,391,415,Public economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Emerging technologies; Precautionary principle; Ignorance; Risk management; Corporate governance; Property insurance; Pooling,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:pal:gpprii:v:35:y:2010:i:3:p:391-415 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00541418 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fgpp.2010.11.pdf http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/265043 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/gpp.2010.11 https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/gpprii/v35y2010i3p391-415.html http://www.palgrave-journals.com/gpp/journal/v35/n3/abs/gpp201011a.html https://link.springer.com/10.1057/gpp.2010.11 https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/44698 https://telearn.archives-ouvertes.fr/X-DEP-SHS/hal-00541418 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/63844,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/gpp.2010.11,,10.1057/gpp.2010.11,1982649050,,0,000-406-657-448-02X; 001-010-021-759-506; 001-563-898-115-467; 007-076-771-745-840; 015-445-185-841-400; 016-612-533-691-683; 019-739-760-807-68X; 022-105-710-251-939; 025-871-583-171-064; 030-383-262-007-667; 031-395-590-019-581; 050-282-502-629-362; 054-626-982-730-866; 060-429-648-432-286; 061-827-790-763-051; 068-331-496-796-51X; 069-543-398-234-186; 070-679-475-196-215; 074-250-574-192-926; 086-410-619-460-513; 091-160-062-621-843; 104-935-828-873-843; 109-219-502-587-059; 117-915-029-918-682; 120-217-024-608-052; 126-002-985-423-751; 130-647-505-707-097; 146-107-783-833-628; 152-858-123-379-479; 174-527-769-110-788; 182-634-124-738-723; 185-032-121-314-264; 186-922-422-613-648; 191-073-230-528-972; 199-986-278-559-652,11,True,,green,lens

Dual representations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to obtain the main results of this paper on time consistency; namely, an equivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to multiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of multivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets with transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal (1995), Roux and Zastawniak (2016), Loehne and Rudloff (2014)) does not satisfy the usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in (Feinstein and Rudloff (2020)), scalar risk measures with the same scalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The deduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time consistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires consideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a direct notion of a ""moving scalarization"" for scalar time consistency that corroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi-objective problems (Karnam, Ma, and Zhang (2017), Kovacova and Rudloff (2020)).",38,3-4,71,90,Time consistency; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Dual (category theory); Multivariate statistics; Asset (economics); Relation (database); Risk measure; Mathematics; Scalar (mathematics),,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/strm-2019-0023/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/strm-2019-0023,,10.1515/strm-2019-0023,3215769609,,0,002-066-066-032-57X; 003-936-622-047-645; 005-030-250-952-450; 005-758-513-341-080; 006-320-797-383-302; 008-689-696-857-030; 009-076-310-251-007; 009-919-056-101-048; 014-053-198-219-136; 014-403-726-793-957; 016-327-690-798-713; 018-248-651-680-656; 024-095-760-822-302; 024-322-418-805-897; 024-943-160-230-29X; 027-256-688-004-017; 031-287-169-355-962; 031-292-614-757-780; 034-613-744-548-622; 036-075-050-719-017; 037-049-850-450-447; 038-769-513-664-489; 039-650-162-527-463; 040-473-621-246-97X; 040-692-674-064-248; 042-572-006-442-764; 044-641-330-862-241; 046-590-043-474-188; 050-504-766-420-600; 051-818-848-639-348; 053-329-447-892-831; 062-363-262-474-209; 068-149-315-750-897; 068-926-087-240-142; 069-847-139-978-765; 072-622-917-376-068; 073-153-783-637-53X; 075-551-691-334-167; 085-751-711-835-962; 086-861-898-357-449; 092-885-097-009-456; 107-901-319-229-64X; 110-133-766-418-951; 114-944-254-020-100; 116-055-564-283-822; 117-019-188-143-866; 121-124-061-280-387; 122-281-393-785-31X; 135-125-407-277-760; 142-947-589-096-499; 143-479-558-855-300; 147-670-448-067-785; 150-131-233-965-911; 150-439-525-127-478; 153-268-726-676-954; 158-242-767-403-166; 164-630-239-386-798; 164-711-155-076-973; 167-800-976-805-727; 177-906-047-759-381; 197-514-981-122-366,3,True,,green,lens

From the national level, financial risk investment activities directly affect the development process of the information technology industry and social and economic benefits. The management of financial risk investment has received more attention, and the types and difficulties of risks are also gradually increasing. Financial regulatory agencies urgently need to establish a sensitive and scientific economic hazard early alarm system. The perfect earlier alarm system stands based on in-depth scientific theoretical research, so studying financial security evaluation and systemic economic earlier alarm systems is of great practical significance. Taking the systemic financial risk as the research object, this paper analyzes the mechanism of financial systemic risk. After that, deep learning technology in financial investment has been used for the first time to reconstruct the index system of financial security evaluation and early warning.

107-270-770-561-622,What Do FAS 157 “Fair Values” Really Measure: Value Or Risk?,2012-09-13,2012.0,journal article,Accounting Perspectives,1911382x; 19113838,Wiley,United States,Joshua Ronen,"FAS 157, the U.S. accounting standard that prescribes how fair values of assets and liabilities are to be measured when other U.S. GAAP standards require fair valuation, stipulates that fair values be measured as the exit values of assets and liabilities—the proceeds for assets hypothetically sold on the date of the financial report, and, correspondingly, the amount required to settle liabilities on the date of the financial report. This conceptual article argues that exit values do not reflect the value of the net assets of the firm to shareholders, which is best reflected by discounted cash flows to maturity. Moreover, exit values—biasing fair values downward when markets are illiquid—have a pernicious, systemic risk effect; specifically, they give rise to write-downs that in turn cause contagion: prices of equities and other financial instruments of peers react negatively, leading to further write-downs by those peers. This may have aggravated the recent financial crisis. However, while exit values are not proper measures of value to shareholders, they are useful measures of downside risk when prospects turn sour for a firm. Thus, both exit values and discounted cash flows should be presented in financial statements.; ; ; Que mesure veritablement la FAS 157 sur les justes valeurs  : la valeur ou le risque?; Resume; ; La FAS 157, la norme comptable des Etats-Unis qui prescrit comment determiner les justes valeurs des actifs et des passifs pour repondre aux exigences des autres PCGR americains pouvant exiger ce type d'evaluation, stipule que les justes valeurs doivent etre etablies en fonction des valeurs de sortie des actifs et des passifs — soit, dans le cas des actifs, le produit de leur vente hypothetique a la date du rapport financier et, reciproquement dans le cas des passifs, la somme necessaire a leur reglement a la date du rapport financier. Dans le document de reflexion qu'il propose, l'auteur affirme que les valeurs de sortie ne refletent pas la valeur des actifs nets de l'entreprise pour les actionnaires, et que la valeur la plus representative est celle des flux de tresorerie a l'echeance actualises. En outre, l'utilisation des valeurs de sortie — qui entraine une distorsion des valeurs a la baisse lorsque les marches sont illiquides — a un effet pernicieux sur le risque systemique; en effet, elle provoque des reductions de valeur epidemiques : le cours des actions et autres instruments financiers des homologues reagit negativement, ce qui entraine chez eux de nouvelles reductions de valeur. Il se peut meme que cet effet d'entrainement ait aggrave la crise financiere recente. Cependant, bien que les valeurs de sortie ne soient pas des mesures appropriees de la valeur pour les actionnaires, il s'agit neanmoins de mesures utiles du risque de chute des cours lorsque les perspectives se gâtent pour une entreprise.

105-053-243-475-155,Regulation by Threat: Dodd-Frank and the Non-Bank Problem,,2016.0,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Daniel Schwarcz; David Zaring,"A central lesson of the global financial crisis is that banks are not the only types of financial firms that can pose dangers to the broader financial system. One of Dodd-Frank’s primary mechanisms for responding to this reality is to empower a council of financial regulators to designate individual non-bank financial institutions as systemically risky. Although the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has only exercised this authority four times, it has occasioned considerable controversy in court, in Congress, and among commentators. This Article defends the FSOC designation scheme, arguing that most of its critics misunderstand the mechanisms by which it helps to reduce systemic risk outside of the banking sector. FSOC designation does not, and cannot, precisely distinguish between firms that could pose a systemic risk and those that could not. FSOC’s broad discretion to impose costly sanctions on designated firms instead advances two quite different goals. First, it deters non-bank firms from seeking out systemically risky strategies or activities. Second, it holds financial regulators to account by threatening to impose additional restrictions and supervision on the firms they regulate if they fail to address systemic risk on their own. We term this approach “regulation by threat,” and suggest that it is appropriate when risks are hard to identify, the perils of mistake are great, and the downsides of misdiagnosis extreme. Systemic risk outside of the banking sector meets this description to a tee. Moreover, we argue that the Council’s discretion is better cabined by its structure – which features diverse membership, voting, review, and political safeguards – than by insistence on particularly “hard look” judicial review, accompanied by the requirement of a cost benefit analysis for any individual designation decision. Similarly, the various reform proposals to limit FSOC’s discretion or impose additional procedural limits on its operations generally threaten to undermine the Council’s effectiveness by unnecessarily limiting its discretion, and thus its capacity to regulate by threat.",,,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Law and economics; Law; Mistake; Discretion; Sanctions; Financial crisis; Judicial review; Voting; Politics,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2865958 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2865958,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2865958,,10.2139/ssrn.2865958,2608632276,,0,027-768-716-887-435; 104-080-284-768-779; 111-313-171-283-319; 152-758-835-616-112; 153-135-083-547-016; 162-418-089-966-541; 172-122-249-675-699,3,True,,green,lens

Using a novel identification strategy exploiting the presence of partially overlapping peer groups, I show that banks’ liquidity transformation activity is driven by that of their peers. These correlated decisions are concentrated on the asset side of riskier banks and are asymmetric, with mimicking occurring only when competitors take more risk. Accordingly, this strategic behavior increases banks’ default risk and overall systemic risk, highlighting the importance of regulating liquidity risk from a macroprudential perspective.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>ReceivedMay 4, 2016; editorial decision January 1, 2019 by Editor Philip Strahan.

However, macro data, while helpful, may mask or differ from certain micro trends. This could be due to the crosssubsidisation effect when aggregating micro data. For example, potential financial stress within certain income groups in the household sector may be artificially suppressed by other income groups that have larger financial buffers, creating the inaccurate conclusion that the entire household sector is sound. On the contrary, granular information could reflect more specific individual behaviours.

158-742-124-495-002,THE FEASIBILITY OF FARM REVENUE INSURANCE IN AUSTRALIA,,,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Miranda P.M. Meuwissen; Ruud B.M. Huirne; J. Brian Hardaker,"Arrow (1965) stated that making markets for trading risk more complete can be socially beneficial. Within this perspective, we discuss the feasibility of farm revenue insurance for Australian agriculture. The feasibility is first discussed from an insurer's point of view. Well-known problems of moral hazard, adverse selection and systemic risk are central. Then, the feasibility is studied from a farmer’s point of view. A simulation model illustrates that gross revenue insurance can be both cheaper and more effective than separate price and yield insurance schemes. We argue that due to the systemic nature of price and yields risks within years and the positive correlation between years, some publicprivate partnership for reinsurance may be necessary for insurers to enter the gross revenue insurance market. Pros and cons of alternative forms of a public-private partnership are discussed. Once insurers can deal with the systemic risk problem, we conclude that there are opportunities for crop gross revenue insurance schemes, especially if based on area yields and on observed spot market prices. For insurance schemes to cover individual farmer’s yields and prices, we regard the concept of coinsurance as crucial. With respect to livestock commodities, we argue that yields are difficult to include in an insurance scheme and we propose aspects of further research in the field of price and rainfall insurance.",,,,,Bond insurance; General insurance; Business; Actuarial science; Business interruption insurance; Casualty insurance; Group insurance; Auto insurance risk selection; Insurance policy; Risk pool,,,,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/124090 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ags:aare99:124090,http://dx.doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.124090,,10.22004/ag.econ.124090,1518443782,,0,018-318-894-654-189; 043-594-818-047-165; 060-445-960-418-788; 091-160-062-621-843; 093-637-401-851-001; 103-398-128-314-234; 152-858-123-379-479; 154-259-717-870-298; 180-667-229-368-931,0,False,,,lens

A key challenge is the absence of metrics that relate physical risk to financial risk, either at the company or at the portfolio level, resulting in the lack of asset risk pricing. Our research tests the hypothesis that water risk impacts revenue and the cost of doing business and, by inference stock volatility, unless the company manages its risk appropriately. We related stock volatility metrics and water risk exposures of four electric utilities during a two-year period (2007-2008) that captured multiple drought events, commodity (coal) price fluctuations, and systemic risk in the financial markets. Using waterBeta and waterVaR metrics, the impact of water risk on stock volatility (VaR) was highly dependent on the value chain position of the firm, the capital efficiency of water, and stock elasticity. WaterVaR values range from $5M for the Southern Company to $167M for AES. The use of financial risk metrics for water can improve decisions for asset allocation to reduce water risk exposure in portfolios, including stranded assets.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Equity risk; Capital asset pricing model; Diversification (finance); Liquidity risk; Financial risk management; Economic capital; Financial risk,,,,,http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/107349/1237_Adriaens.pdf?sequence=1 http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/107349/1/1237_Adriaens.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2445580 https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/107349 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2445580_code561150.pdf?abstractid=2445580&mirid=4 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2445580_code561150.pdf?abstractid=2445580&mirid=1 https://core.ac.uk/display/108319595 http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/107349,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2445580,,10.2139/ssrn.2445580,146036435,,0,003-772-781-547-198; 006-539-674-203-304; 031-587-368-579-496; 039-877-350-534-181; 051-975-482-109-930; 059-115-916-998-001; 069-399-739-973-558; 086-317-786-026-830; 095-152-176-399-481; 105-207-237-147-621; 110-672-074-567-828; 125-858-936-666-302; 130-320-654-993-520; 139-631-621-583-31X,4,True,,green,lens

Firstly, we define a basic industrial district through a set of assumptions which prove to be critical for systemic risk in the event of a financial shock. In the course of the work we progressively relax the assumptions to make room for more complex representations. Consequently, depending on two dimensions of complexity (structure of economic interactions and the degree of heterogeneity of the industrial population), we develop three different models of industrial clusters, employing non-linear ordinary differential equations and percolation dynamics in graph theory. A mechanism of financial contagion is introduced and a threshold condition is derived in order to study each model’s resilience. Eventually, we prove that it is the structure of economic interactions which produces a structural change in the threshold characterization.",,,,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Actuarial science; Economics; Structure (mathematical logic); Resilience (network); Industrial district; Financial contagion; Population; Shock (economics); Graph theory,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:usi:wpaper:654,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:usi:wpaper:654,,,2268728167,,0,001-143-989-871-830; 004-682-225-354-448; 006-026-925-033-378; 024-137-741-835-928; 036-880-120-434-642; 081-127-988-003-961; 083-891-457-965-148; 091-129-447-967-233; 104-883-306-292-441; 161-374-330-129-435; 167-839-309-782-400,0,False,,,lens

We find that in general the systemic risk categories defined by the Financial Stability Board are dfferent from those constructed in a full pairwise comparison approach based on the market measures. Moreover, these dfferences were more pronounced during episodes of high market turbulence.To account for model risk we introduce a more robust ranking method based on nonparametric confidence intervals. We show that there is a large number of banks with overlapping confidence intervals of their market-based systemic risk measures.Further, similarity measures indicate that the scoring based rankings are not perfectly aligned with rankings produced by market based systemic risk measures.",,,,,Nonparametric statistics; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Model risk; Market based; Confidence interval; Reliability (statistics),,,,,https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/123456789/15525/1/BoF_DP_1813.pdf https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/handle/123456789/15525 https://ideas.repec.org/p/bof/bofrdp/2018_013.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bof:bofrdp:2018_013,https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/handle/123456789/15525,,,2886841552,,0,,0,False,,,lens

126-638-597-616-272,The Linkage between Stock Market and Macroeconomic Fundamentals: The Case of Athens Stock Exchange,2005-01-03,2005.0,journal article,Journal of Financial Management and analysis,,,,Melina Dritsaki,"IntroductionIn recent years, the effects of fundamental macroeconomic news on stock price movements have received a considerable attention. The role that macroeconomic news play in explaining the movements in stock prices is very important both for practitioners and academic researchers. Practitioners are perhaps interested in using the information about macroeconomic fundamentals in pricing assets or alternatively making decisions about real investments. On the other hand, academic economists may be interested because this will help them to identify some sources of systemic risks, and to consider whether these risks are priced (as the should) on the stock market.The news approach is based on the efficient market hypothesis, which attributed movements in asset prices to new information (hat effects either the expected future cash flows or the expected discount rates at which those cash flows are capitalized, or both. According to Fama1, a stock market is efficient if current market prices fully and instantaneously reflect all available information. Another important aspect is that the expected or past information contains no new information and therefore should have no effect on stock prices, since this information has already been incorporated into prevailing market prices. Hence, the implication of market efficiency is that if economic agents are careful users of available information, then stock price changes can only be due to news, about, for example, macroeconomic fundamentals.There is a branch of economic studies testing the relevance of macro-economic news for stock price movements. The empirical evidence (eg. see Pearce and Roley2; Hardouvelis3; Wasserfallcn4; Aggarwal and Shirm5; Sadeghi6; McQueen and Roley7; Siklos and Anusiewicz8; and Ewing9) suggests that stock returns respond to news, However, these results show that news can only explain a small fraction of observed variations in equity returns (Roll10 and Cutler, Poterba and Summers""), even some of the influences are significant at conventional levels. In general, these results indicate that stock returns primarily respond to monetary news while non-monetary news seems to have only weaker effects. The empirical evidence also seems to be sample-specific and unstable over time (Orphanides12).The objective of this paper is to investigate the causal relations among macro-economic variables such as:* Inflation* Interest rates* Industrial productionand the stock market index in the small and open Greek economy, where financial markets are less mature as compared to those in eg US, Japan and the UK.The paper concentrates on the relationship between macro economy and the stock market in Greece by asking the following questions:1. Does GEN cause the index of industrial production (IPI)?2. Do interest rates (RFR) cause GEN?3. Does inflation (INF) cause the industrial production index?4. Does industrial production cause inflation?5. Does inflation cause interest rates?6. Does GEN cause inflation?7. Does industrial production cause interest rates?8. Does Gen cause interest rates?9. Does industrial production cause GEN?10. Do interest rates cause inflation?11. Does inflation cause GEN?12. Do interest rates cause industrial production?PreludeWithout a precise economic theory that explains the link between macro-economy and the stock market, the decision about which fundamental economic variables are to be included in the analysis is somewhat arbitrarily. In reality several factors may have impacts on stock prices. Therefore, some simplifying assumptions about investors' relevant information set as a proxy for the true information set are required. However, since this paper deals with a small open economy, the following macroeconomic indicators are required to describe both real and financial conditions of the domestic economy:1) Logarithm of Industrial Production Index, (IPI), is included as a proxy for real economic activity in the Greek market, since the weight of the stock market is accounted for by services, utilities, public and semi-public firms. …",18,1,38,47,Economics; Interest rate; Financial market; Stock exchange; Small open economy; Stock market; Monetary economics; Market price; Industrial production; Stock market index,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-911823871/linkage-between-stock-market-and-macroeconomic-fundamentals https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/publications/628121,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-911823871/linkage-between-stock-market-and-macroeconomic-fundamentals,,,3123919218,,0,,17,False,,,lens

Higher margins are also negatively related to the conditional mean of stock returns, apparently because they reduce systemic risk. We conclude that a prudential rule for setting margins (or other regulatory restrictions) is to lower them in sharply declining markets in order to enhance liquidity and avoid a depyramiding effect in stock prices, but subsequently raise them and keep them at the higher level in order to prevent a future pyramiding effect.

182-063-134-795-960,An Examination of Rating Corporate Bonds Through the Cycle,,2008.0,,,,,,Ash Evans,"Changing credit rating migration intensities over the business cycle has been the subject of numerous studies (for example, Nickell et al. (2000) and Bangia et al. (2002)). Standard & Poor’s, however, asserts that credit ratings are based on through the cycle measures; meaning that changes in the default risk should affect an issuer’s credit rating only if these changes are persistent. Short-term fluctuations in default risk, such as a recession or uncharacteristic asset write-offs, should not affect the credit rating. Through an adaptation of a runs test and smoothed intensity estimates, we are able to demonstrate that the baseline downgrade intensity of Evans (2007) is not constant, and thus reject the policy of rating through the cycle. The rejection of rating through the cycle has asset management ramifications. A consequence of non-constant baseline downgrade intensities is that there are systemic risks of credit re-evaluations that cannot be neutralised by large diversified debt portfolios. Where there is a strong relationship between debt value and credit rating, the sustenance of portfolios because of finite debt maturity means that industryor economy-wide fluctuations in migrations intensities can result in large realised losses. Furthermore, systemic downgrade risks have implications for a bank’s compliance with the Basel II Accord, where quality restrictions for capital provisions are in place.",,,,,Debt; Systemic risk; Economics; Credit rating; Downgrade; Basel II; Monetary economics; Default; Bond; Business cycle,,,,,https://www.actuaries.asn.au/Library/Events/FSF/2008/FSF08_2f_Paper_Evans_An%20Examination%20of%20Rating%20Corporate%20Bonds%20Through%20the%20Cycle.pdf,https://www.actuaries.asn.au/Library/Events/FSF/2008/FSF08_2f_Paper_Evans_An%20Examination%20of%20Rating%20Corporate%20Bonds%20Through%20the%20Cycle.pdf,,,2184115018,,0,004-444-967-570-541; 008-282-074-130-617; 009-509-560-597-247; 013-295-026-779-212; 029-192-991-932-396; 030-824-936-228-599; 031-799-946-627-002; 048-087-096-846-349; 050-396-014-815-161; 056-715-521-661-105; 064-293-340-018-981; 065-829-054-116-66X; 078-924-480-561-077; 089-920-143-494-943; 091-588-228-793-010; 096-410-282-146-731; 115-902-406-480-810; 119-070-020-653-412; 126-103-695-973-977; 137-062-871-039-94X; 154-802-874-949-065; 168-141-203-519-067; 177-885-796-907-660,0,False,,,lens

Whereas some aggregate indicators have shown improvement over the year, the cumulative growth rates in consumption and fixed asset investment have continued their downward trajectories. Worsening income inequality and resource misallocations, both between secondary and tertiary industries, and within the latter, pose serious challenges, let alone the systemic risk associated with the flourishing shadow banking system, rapid credit growth and debt overhang that weigh on the Chinese economy like the Sword of Damocles. This summary report highlights both the status quo and the consequences of the unbalanced and inadequate development embodied in Chinai¯s persistently distorted economic structure, and the role of deepening reforms of the institutions and governance in resolving the problems. Our analyses based on IAR-CMM model provide a unified framework for addressing Chinai¯s short-, medium-, and long-term issues in an internally coherent manner. Looking into year 2018, our benchmark projection of real GDP growth rate is 6.7% (6.41% using more reliable rather than the official data). Alternative scenario analyses and policy simulations are conducted to reflect various aspects of the economic challenges in the short to long runs. Through the lens of these analyses we conclude that rule-of-law based and market-oriented structural reforms should continue to hold a center stage in Chinai¯s transition from a phase of high-speed but unbalanced growth, to a stage of balanced and adequate high-quality development.",13,2,147,170,Consumption (economics); Macroeconomics; Systemic risk; Economics; Real gross domestic product; Debt overhang; Shadow banking system; Fixed asset; Tertiary sector of the economy; Economic inequality,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fec/journl/v13y2018i2p147-170.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:fec:journl:v:13:y:2018:i:2:p:147-170 https://journal.hep.com.cn/fec/EN/10.3868/s060-007-018-0011-0 https://academic.hep.com.cn/fec/CN/10.3868/s060-007-018-0011-0,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fec/journl/v13y2018i2p147-170.html,,,2801367505,,0,,3,False,,,lens
067-698-192-418-557,Systemic Liquidity Risk,,2012.0,,Economic Studies journal,02053292,Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite,Bulgaria,Moshe Kim; Diana Bonfim,"The new Basel III regulatory package offers the fi rst global framework for the regulation of liquidity risk. This new regulation intends to address the externalities imposed upon the rest of the fi nancial system (and, ultimately, on the real economy) generated by excessive maturity mismatches. Nevertheless, the new regulation focuses essentially on the externalities generated by each bank individually, thus being dominantly microprudential. We argue that there might also be a specifi c role for the macroprudential regulation of liquidity risk, most notably in what concerns systemic risk. Our argument is based on theoretical results by Farhi and Tirole (2012) and Ratnovski (2009), and on empirical evidence by Bonfi m and Kim (2012). In this article we present some of those empirical results, which provide evidence supporting the existence of collective risk-taking strategies in liquidity risk management, most notably amongst the largest banks.",,,,,Systemic risk; Externality; Economics; Empirical evidence; Liquidity risk; Basel III; Macroprudential regulation; Maturity (finance); Financial risk management; Financial system,,,,,http://www.bportugal.pt/en-US/BdP%20Publications%20Research/AR201204_e.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/ptu/bdpart/r201204.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ptu:bdpart:r201204,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ptu/bdpart/r201204.html,,,2267705675,,0,002-856-834-652-090; 005-192-586-919-584; 005-391-793-306-563; 006-599-198-213-417; 006-891-876-400-616; 007-236-021-000-209; 008-084-214-919-920; 008-698-011-030-028; 012-096-907-574-534; 021-531-838-255-045; 021-682-248-071-789; 024-055-080-078-288; 024-375-879-515-197; 026-046-227-276-595; 030-558-389-854-099; 031-808-539-722-506; 032-002-706-389-83X; 032-868-123-412-791; 035-104-934-704-682; 037-270-186-581-264; 038-080-443-203-467; 039-586-099-678-707; 039-775-849-553-632; 041-989-801-897-693; 044-035-605-650-724; 044-193-871-778-089; 045-705-979-262-060; 046-141-661-686-408; 046-601-971-132-78X; 051-615-816-981-077; 052-048-290-746-395; 058-273-019-371-687; 059-156-374-169-903; 065-729-056-509-725; 073-453-494-732-084; 073-492-937-191-240; 074-849-208-298-983; 076-088-192-927-763; 076-099-829-248-359; 078-100-323-398-438; 093-549-585-001-457; 096-294-866-114-244; 098-486-876-718-307; 108-324-595-693-341; 110-163-234-728-008; 111-569-525-739-598; 114-486-857-444-29X; 115-085-795-539-814; 115-299-673-622-234; 122-046-077-504-686; 122-257-427-382-448; 124-751-463-797-858; 142-685-526-992-942; 142-787-047-914-450; 143-603-999-395-667; 144-464-385-489-801; 145-930-473-671-031; 148-861-751-440-552; 150-347-168-528-987; 168-809-691-072-790; 169-632-734-749-948; 170-360-543-426-141; 177-505-200-433-525; 182-401-964-998-619; 198-054-352-520-806,2,False,,,lens

In addition to addressing these issues, this paper will also consider other issues related to long term funding, which affect financial stability and development in Low Income Developing Countries (LIDCs) - namely inadequate regulatory frameworks, as well as constraints and accessibility to long term funding. By considering the recent developments with the Basel framework, it will seek to illustrate, by way of reference to studies, why low income developing countries, as well as selected emerging economies are still lagging behind in terms of the implementation of regulatory standards. It will also aim to demonstrate how these countries would largely benefit from effective implementation of these standards. Whilst aiming to facilitate means whereby sources of longer term funding could be enhanced, it will also consider the disadvantages and risks associated with longer term funding, challenges imposed by debt sustainability and propose alternative sources of funding. Transparency and disclosure, it will be highlighted, continue to generate severe obstacles to financial development and growth, as will be reflected from results of certain investigations.",,,,,Public economics; Debt; Emerging markets; Business; Systemic risk; Liquidity risk; Lagging; Financial regulation; Transparency (graphic); Developing country,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/62383.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/62383.html,,,3142036157,,0,,0,False,,,lens
027-236-895-537-790,Vers une redéfinition du rôle de l’assurance agricole dans la gestion des risques sur récoltes,,1998.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Olivier Mahul,"Farmers make their production decisions in an environment characterized by multiple uncertainty. Protective activities do not always provide an efficient protection against weather-related causes of loss. Agricultural revenues are all the more exposed to uncertain losses as the specialization of agricultural production has reduced the opportunities of risk pooling. Insurance contributes to transferring these risks through individuals who are best to bear them. Nevertheless, historical experience strongly suggests that markets for crop insurance would fail without government financial support, which is either direct by creating an indemnification fund for agricultural disasters like in France or indirect by reinsuring private companies like in the United States. In recent years, numerous studies have showed that informational asymmetries and systemic risk are the main obstacles to the development of an independent crop insurance industry. In addition, the emergence of new sources of risks, like output price uncertainty, may contribute to increasing the variability of agricultural revenues. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, alternative crop insurance programs in which the indemnity payments are based on variables exogenous to the individual farm and are observable by both parties are explored. These schemes allow the insurers to essentially eliminate asymmetric information problems. Nevertheless, the absence of risk pooling among insurance companies caused by the systemic component of agricultural risks leaves open the possibility that financial markets develop new hedging tools for insurance industry. Second, since governments lower funding for price support programs, the efficiency of crop insurance schemes to stabilize crop revenues lowers. Therefore, the role of revenue insurance as an efficient tool to protect farmers against reductions in gross income from insurable reductions in yield and/or price is examined. Since the French indemnification program against agricultural disasters turns out to be less and less efficient in this changing economic environment, a new definition of the insurance markets role and the active participation of the financial market should improve the management of agricultural risks.",,,,,Agricultural productivity; Information asymmetry; Business; Systemic risk; Natural resource economics; Financial market; Revenue; Crop insurance; Price support; Risk pool,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:journl:hal-01200910 https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-01200910.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:journl:hal-01200910,,,3123953612,,0,,2,False,,,lens

Morgan (review)",2013-12-01,2013.0,journal article,Journal of Southeast Asian Economies,,,,Christopher Napoli,"Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Financial Reform and Regulation in Asia. Edited by Masahiro Kawai, David G. Mayes and Peter J. Morgan. Cheltenham and Northampton: Edward Elgar Publishing and Asian Development Bank Institute, 2012. Pp. 296. The 2008 crisis demonstrated the fragility of financial markets and the systemic effects that individual banks can have on both financial systems and the real economy. The edited book Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Financial Reform and Regulation in Asia, jointly published by the Asian Development Bank Institute and Edward Elgar Publishing, offers a timely and thorough analysis of what the 2008 crisis has meant for Asian markets. As such, it fills a gap in the literature which, to date, has primarily examined the effects of the crisis on the economies of developed countries in the West. According to the authors, the book's central purpose is to identify the challenges imposed by the 2008 global financial crisis and suggest policy reforms. Within this context, the book examines the evolving regulatory framework for global finance and capital markets. The overarching conclusion is neatly summarized in a quote from Chapter 2, which states that ""the Westphalian principals of sovereignty that govern international financial oversight are not suited to the realities of an interconnected financial system"". Throughout the book, numerous examples are offered of the disconnect between financial regulation, which is typically national or regional, and finance, which is global. Based on these observations, the book offers recommendations for how financial systems can improve international cooperation through establishing macroprudential regulation, coordinating risk analysis, and increasing information sharing--which the book argues is a prerequisite for understanding and monitoring systemic risk. While the claim that international cooperation in finance needs improvement is not particularly innovative, the book adds value to the debate in four ways. First, while the arguments and analysis are technical, each chapter is well written and clearly presented. Moreover, the chapters are complimentary, meaning that although each section can be read in isolation, the whole book offers a rounded assessment of the challenges states face when trying to balance economic growth with financial stability. The rounded assessment is due in part to the fact that the authors come from diverse institutions from around the world, as well as the structure of the book, which is divided into four sections. Sections I and II examine how Asian governments and regulators can strengthen financial surveillance and monitoring. Section III examines the role of the state in crisis management and resolution. The rationale for addressing both crisis prevention and resolution comes from the book's assertion that while improvements can be made to reduce the likelihood of financial crises, risk cannot be fully eliminated. Because of this, crisis resolution procedures must be developed and well understood. With the goals of prevention and containment, Section IV looks to the future, examining the pros and cons of Asia's rapidly developing bond markets, an important issue given the importance that sovereign and corporate debt play in economic growth. Second, in addition to the clarity and depth of analysis, the book offers innovative guidelines for regulating financial institutions in Asia and elsewhere. …",30,3,334,335,Finance; Structured finance; Capital market; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial crisis; Macroprudential regulation; Geography of finance; Financial regulation; Financial econometrics,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-354660977/implications-of-the-global-financial-crisis-for-financial https://muse.jhu.edu/article/536137/summary,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-354660977/implications-of-the-global-financial-crisis-for-financial,,,280038369,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Acharya; Tanju Yorulmazer,"Two aspects of systemic risk, the risk that banks fail together, are modeled and their interaction examined. First, the ex-post aspect, in which the failure of a bank brings down a surviving bank as well, and second, the ex-ante aspect, in which banks endogenously hold correlated portfolios increasing the likelihood of joint failure. When bank loan returns have a systematic factor, the failure of one bank conveys adverse information about this systematic factor and increases the cost of borrowing for the surviving banks. Such information contagion is thus costly to bank owners. Given their limited liability, banks herd ex-ante and undertake correlated investments to increase the likelihood of joint survival. If the depositors of a failed bank can migrate to the surviving bank, then herding incentives are partially mitigated and this gives rise to a pro-cyclical pattern in the correlation of bank loan returns. The direction of information contagion, the localized nature of contagion and herding, and the welfare properties, are also characterized.",,,,,Welfare; Correlation; Limited liability; Business; Systemic risk; Herding; Loan; Incentive; Information spillover; Monetary economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/3743.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cpr:ceprdp:3743,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/3743.html,,,3123759446,,0,,9,False,,,lens

Measuring the systemic risk of an individual hedge fund by using the marginal expected shortfall (MES), we find evidence for a positive and statistically significant relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns. The risk-adjusted return of a hedge fund portfolio with a high systemic risk is 0.64% per month higher than for one with a low systemic risk during 1994–2012, while negative performance is observed during crisis periods. The relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns holds for both live and defunct funds. Moreover, the relation holds even after controlling for a large set of fund characteristics. Hence, systemic risk is a powerful determinant of cross-sectional variations in hedge fund returns. Our results imply that the positive relation between hedge fund returns and systemic risk is due to compensation for the realized losses during systemic events.",42,,109,130,Financial economics; Open-end fund; Economics; Target date fund; Alternative beta; Hedge fund; Fund of funds; Returns-based style analysis; Monetary economics; Performance fee; Income fund,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:empfin:v:42:y:2017:i:c:p:109-130 https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/339927 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/empfin/v42y2017icp109-130.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927539817300245 https://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMAMEETINGS/EFMA%20ANNUAL%20MEETINGS/2011-Braga/papers/0265_update.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/143897089 https://www.efmaefm.org/0EFMAMEETINGS/EFMA%20ANNUAL%20MEETINGS/2011-Braga/papers/0265.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jempfin.2017.03.002,,10.1016/j.jempfin.2017.03.002,2208824853,,0,000-846-266-307-085; 001-274-723-652-948; 003-467-629-451-027; 006-360-800-979-032; 007-080-700-541-738; 007-950-273-735-509; 008-620-705-366-714; 009-379-393-726-466; 011-130-657-217-445; 011-183-962-226-857; 014-786-149-879-179; 017-794-695-634-717; 022-471-721-196-971; 022-879-860-770-354; 023-488-846-036-223; 023-946-520-237-08X; 024-661-145-305-606; 025-600-315-323-004; 026-147-434-234-198; 026-449-509-255-772; 028-505-074-001-736; 029-364-412-985-476; 030-860-415-502-335; 033-439-070-571-094; 035-104-934-704-682; 040-204-360-693-062; 040-767-364-258-788; 042-000-219-862-339; 042-301-632-077-050; 044-209-030-099-069; 044-878-930-581-799; 045-320-906-901-370; 046-186-491-880-038; 048-363-026-036-293; 051-095-045-935-892; 054-338-346-617-321; 056-084-592-994-224; 058-956-150-961-52X; 061-484-299-156-129; 064-467-898-296-216; 070-251-441-596-141; 071-469-873-440-173; 074-747-576-504-229; 076-802-024-042-726; 076-995-018-624-328; 077-180-064-308-640; 077-216-549-597-681; 080-221-503-785-366; 081-855-463-221-304; 088-352-504-423-819; 088-670-290-046-803; 092-944-979-479-617; 095-848-441-887-992; 100-910-802-848-846; 103-946-156-153-487; 107-459-777-852-202; 111-255-013-433-673; 112-360-441-102-804; 115-806-665-215-624; 118-258-915-146-305; 119-165-772-598-331; 119-208-979-453-321; 126-308-824-855-723; 126-393-453-632-510; 127-434-609-562-040; 133-577-082-486-824; 135-050-908-326-256; 142-357-234-903-255; 147-796-487-754-469; 153-779-195-390-459; 154-852-913-638-653; 169-437-380-779-555; 171-676-525-620-124; 177-208-675-078-538; 180-551-788-416-325; 196-841-517-297-105,6,True,cc-by-nc-nd,green,lens
071-212-916-420-110,Sustainable Corporations in Non-Financial Sectors Through Optimal Design of Executive Pay,2013-07-01,2013.0,journal article,German Law Journal,20718322,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,David E. Hansen,"After the 2008 financial crisis lawmakers and regulators were ultimately convinced that they should act on the basis of the theory that flaws in compensation schemes created incentives for executives and other financial industry employees to take on excessive risk, which in the aggregate led to the creation of systemic risk that posed an immeasurable threat to the US and world economies. Congress attempted to resolve these problems through the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. However, the provisions for executive pay packages in the financial industry have not yet been adequately implemented to achieve the legislative goal of preventing excessive risk-taking and systemic risks that can induce financial crises in the future. Furthermore, there is need for corporate governance regulation of the same quality both in the financial and other business sectors, since – as economic history has clearly shown – crises can equally originate in failures of non-financial businesses. Moreover, by pursuing regulatory intervention in the compensation policies of all type of publicly held corporations, two major drawbacks can simultaneously be remedied: major economic recessions and the pay without performance fallacy. Because say-on-pay rights and compensation committee independence do not enable the shareholders and the board of directors to exercise their shareholding or monitoring rights and control functions effectively, they cannot offer a real solution to the principal-agent problem and align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. It is necessary for Congress and the SEC to complement the organizational and procedural provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with some guidelines and extensive disclosure obligations for compensation committees to comply with when deciding on compensation policies and individual incentive plans. There could be minimum standards for the design of compensation schemes in non-financial sectors, which would prescribe a bipartite pay package consisting of a fixed and a variable part. The variable part should be larger than the fixed part and mainly consist of performance-vested restricted stock to ensure that the board and the compensation committee only pay for performance. Furthermore, an executive should be obliged to hold an equity grant for a fixed period of time after it vests. After this pre-specified period the executive would be free to unwind a certain percentage of equity. On each of the following anniversary dates, the executive would be free to unwind another part of the grant. This rule will prevent a manager from attempting to manipulate stock prices to earn more in any given year at the expense of the stock price of her company’s equities in the more distant future. It is also of cardinal importance that the minimum standards for the optimal design of compensation schemes provide incentives that go against rather than with the prevailing direction of the business cycle and that this will be reflected in the mechanism of unloading equities. At the beginning of business cycles, especially when the market and/or the firm is growing, the unwinding of equities should be countercyclical. The amount of equities that may be unloaded on the anniversary dates after one, two, and three years of operation should be much lower than the amount of equities that can be unloaded in later years. This mechanism fosters strategic thinking, prevents excessive risk-taking, enhances a company’s competitiveness and ensures its viability.",14,7,715,748,Finance; Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Restricted stock; Executive compensation; Pay for performance; Equity (finance); Financial crisis; Corporate governance,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2071832200002005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s2071832200002005,,10.1017/s2071832200002005,3122943085,,0,003-800-122-106-239; 006-418-058-658-144; 008-244-104-979-260; 008-700-394-622-580; 015-333-111-023-847; 019-384-900-120-047; 024-106-891-546-548; 026-557-199-755-672; 028-396-242-695-280; 032-299-300-365-336; 040-312-243-053-443; 048-949-181-925-195; 062-507-257-797-273; 071-099-507-704-700; 077-189-436-123-032; 101-441-203-948-236; 114-229-533-607-702; 117-549-019-806-970; 132-077-325-891-000; 161-318-730-885-524; 165-068-798-847-82X; 171-905-028-811-823; 180-008-404-369-490; 182-136-937-868-224; 193-247-065-138-101; 198-059-691-759-857,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Externalities are particularly important because they can constitute a serious source of systemic risk.

The systemic risk is composed of two different components: the time and the cross‐dimension. The first refers to the accumulation of banking risk and its interaction with the business cycle, while the second concern, the high‐level concentration of the specific risk on relevant financial institutions. Thanks to the three‐way analysis, we can, on the one hand, estimate a new measure of systemic risk based on these both components, and, on the other hand, we can transparently identify the SIBs (systemically important banks). To this end, we have empirically evaluated and compared the marginal expected shortfall (MES), the SRISK measure and the conditional value at risk (CoVaR) based on a representative sample of Eurozone institutions listed on the stock exchange for the period from June 2005 to May 2018. Our results show how these systemic risk measures produce different systemic risk classifications for the same bank. The findings, therefore, highlight the fragility and structural dependence of these measures, which may not be used for the estimation of a stable rank. Applying three‐way factorial analysis, we show how our measure gives a more stable score. Moreover, our index is the first one to be composed of both the cross‐section and the temporal components, essential elements for a proper assessment of systemic risk.",26,1,7,26,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Stock exchange; Composite index; Dimension (data warehouse); Specific risk; Index (economics); Expected shortfall; Business cycle,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/ijfiec/v26y2021i1p7-26.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijfe.2386,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijfe.2386,,10.1002/ijfe.2386,3112235276,,0,000-256-970-565-117; 001-274-723-652-948; 009-201-191-359-532; 010-745-923-541-462; 013-043-944-996-872; 016-375-129-358-33X; 018-168-475-223-121; 022-358-408-158-616; 024-828-296-919-906; 029-652-108-487-444; 029-956-347-631-055; 032-645-349-246-900; 036-760-762-204-068; 045-705-979-262-060; 056-084-592-994-224; 057-175-125-323-966; 068-094-403-162-301; 074-170-580-336-674; 076-122-538-972-390; 078-091-852-992-174; 079-903-845-063-841; 083-508-652-775-775; 084-090-075-592-338; 097-352-194-138-508; 103-921-685-024-217; 115-806-665-215-624; 120-169-266-957-075; 122-779-428-131-390; 136-664-109-170-569; 154-309-769-132-265; 155-933-816-096-371; 160-914-439-169-295; 161-388-814-416-825; 164-429-008-440-262; 177-284-407-016-896; 184-114-784-268-660; 187-301-166-275-583,5,False,,,lens

188-000-004-254-189,Oversight Liability for Risk Management Failures at Financial Firms,2011-01-13,2011.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Robert T. Miller,"Many people believe that excessive risk-taking at large financial firms was an important cause of the financial crisis in 2007-2008 and thus that preventing another crisis requires improving risk-management systems at such institutions. One way to do this would be to use board oversight liability to hold directors personally liable for failing properly to monitor the risks that their firms are running. The purpose of this Article is to determine what role director oversight liability can efficiently play in improving risk-management practices at large financial firms.A key contention of the Article is that previous treatments of this problem have largely failed to appreciate what risk managers at large financial firms actually do, and so the Article begins by explaining some of the financial models that risk managers typically use to measure the market risk and credit risk on portfolios of assets. A realistic appreciation of these models shows that the measurements of risk that they yield necessarily incorporate paradigmatic business judgments, most importantly because the models aim to predict future results on the basis of historical data. The predictive ability of the models is founded, in other words, on the business judgment that the future will resemble the past in relevant respects. Risk-management decisions are therefore always business decisions.With this conclusion firmly established, the Article reviews the principles of director oversight liability, the most relevant in this context being that oversight liability requires a showing that the directors were consciously disregarding their duties. This scienter-based standard practically guarantees that oversight claims based on alleged failures to detect and prevent weaknesses in the firm’s risk-management systems will fail, as in fact happened in the Citigroup case, the most important oversight case predicated on alleged risk management failures thus far litigated. The result in Citigroup has been subjected to much academic criticism. The Article considers these criticisms and argues that, in light of the actual nature of risk management and the financial models used therein, these criticisms are generally misguided.The result in Citigroup has also prompted proposals for expanding oversight liability in ways that would allow courts to review substantive risk-management decisions by corporate boards. The Article argues that such proposals are meritless for two reasons. First, because risk-management decisions are always business decisions, and because any business decision leading to losses for the company can be characterized as a risk-management failure, allowing courts to review risk-management decisions in oversight liability cases would in effect repeal the business judgment rule. Second, although such proposed expansions of oversight liability are aimed at limiting the excessive-risking that supposedly contributed to the financial crisis, risk-taking can be excessive in several distinct ways, and the sense in which excessive risk-taking represents a genuine failure of risk-management systems (namely, risk-taking in excess of the risk tolerance of the firm as set by the board) is not the sense in which excessive risk-taking may have been a cause of the financial crisis (namely, socially inefficient risk-taking or excessive systemic risk). Hence, even if expanding oversight liability for risk-management failures did not otherwise involve the tremendous inefficiency of effectively repealing the business judgment rule, such an expansion would still not be well-calculated to address the perceived problem of excessive risk-taking as a cause of the financial crisis.",,,,,Finance; Accounting; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial modeling; Scienter; Liability; Financial crisis; Business judgment rule; Risk management; Business decision mapping,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1739881 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1749718_code518229.pdf?abstractid=1739881,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1739881,,,1510506531,,0,,0,False,,,lens

This study used various financial performance ratios of 50 banks operating in different European countries to investigate if such relationship exists over seven year period. Before working on evaluating the systemic risk we need to know that in order to shape up the financial structure of any firm, the operating performance is of crucial importance. It is expected that the outcomes of this research are of importance both to investors as well as bank managers, as these findings will help them in fully analyzing the effects of various strategic choices keeping in view related to risk profile of banks. Some implications of the potential policy which based on the new capital requirements in view of the risk-leverage relationship have also been discussed in this dissertation.

Matteson,"The electric power grid is a critical societal resource connecting multiple infrastructural domains such as agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject to changes and stresses due to diverse factors including solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology. The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such interactions increasingly dynamic, posing novel risks, and presenting new challenges to manage the coupled human–natural system. This paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across diverse domains that may be used to assess risks to electric grid reliability, including climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domain interconnections. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data science, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union in systemic risk indicators. Our study provides an important first step towards data-driven analysis and predictive modeling of risks in interconnected human–natural systems.",41,4,1,22,Subject-matter expert; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Systemic risk; Interdependence; Grid; Electrical grid; Complex network; Computer science; Resource (project management),Critical risk indicator; Electric power grid; Multi-disciplinary; Risk; Systemic risk; Uncertainty,,,National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07771 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/critical-risk-indicators-cris-for-the-electric-power-grid-a-surve https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:envsyd:v:41:y:2021:i:4:d:10.1007_s10669-021-09822-2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8286170 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-021-09822-2 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10669-021-09822-2.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10669-021-09822-2,34306961,10.1007/s10669-021-09822-2,3185933052,PMC8286170,0,000-896-421-296-028; 001-274-723-652-948; 001-288-537-797-016; 006-635-819-665-420; 007-921-701-780-523; 008-026-941-377-851; 009-917-321-562-488; 010-605-767-362-192; 010-745-246-916-967; 011-696-320-463-563; 011-829-157-003-853; 012-159-025-005-52X; 013-067-662-096-813; 013-659-027-398-408; 017-377-405-400-852; 018-212-696-116-763; 019-302-509-684-462; 020-118-358-211-558; 020-886-475-921-980; 023-033-075-479-091; 024-104-660-855-053; 024-828-296-919-906; 026-681-423-460-106; 030-948-435-359-827; 031-242-646-322-639; 034-014-413-602-255; 037-241-845-227-726; 037-937-850-210-975; 038-598-436-234-923; 040-295-522-162-165; 041-387-484-156-462; 042-439-416-060-07X; 042-592-346-921-372; 044-088-773-377-877; 046-083-539-993-84X; 047-321-350-282-11X; 047-414-425-749-267; 047-497-379-793-932; 047-791-136-795-391; 050-205-590-747-06X; 050-313-277-132-884; 050-494-144-944-032; 052-194-877-257-633; 054-656-519-499-196; 056-413-042-284-660; 059-594-728-979-461; 060-046-441-045-950; 061-253-959-181-920; 064-153-548-851-943; 064-599-069-111-776; 066-129-488-514-808; 069-903-181-064-16X; 071-764-860-252-335; 072-204-138-198-985; 083-246-965-816-737; 085-104-524-613-722; 085-163-107-506-395; 087-251-313-097-660; 087-320-654-206-198; 087-812-422-830-742; 088-748-133-526-595; 091-053-031-674-113; 092-201-781-715-103; 097-453-777-855-560; 098-673-299-691-645; 104-401-971-225-279; 106-584-695-799-918; 110-634-749-285-996; 111-261-068-794-338; 111-515-039-442-613; 112-228-757-382-867; 112-642-347-409-602; 113-883-667-612-822; 117-226-685-883-058; 123-129-712-949-386; 128-409-507-244-027; 135-062-253-091-190; 135-650-108-854-72X; 147-658-559-683-255; 148-287-788-299-19X; 151-357-964-961-250; 155-246-166-066-626; 157-512-937-901-805; 164-623-452-718-610; 166-121-548-085-419; 166-129-773-860-000; 170-579-772-713-482; 177-269-655-815-720; 179-491-394-495-449; 180-376-118-749-838,5,True,,green,lens

Herding can thus produce negative externalities. And in such situations, individuals by definition have insufficient incentives to separate from the herd. But the traditional regulatory response to externality problems is to impose across-the-board mandates. Command-and-control regulation tends to displace one pooling equilibrium by moving behavior to a new, mandated pool. Mortgage regulators, for example, might respond to an unregulated equilibrium where most homeowners start with 2% down by imposing a requirement that causes most homeowners instead to place 10% down. But this Article shows that society can at times be better off if regulation induced separating behaviors by regulated entities. We evaluate a variety of mechanisms including licenses, subsidies and regulatory variances as well as regulatory menus and heterogeneous altering rules that can incentivize a limited number of regulated entities to take the path less chosen. Anti-herding regulation provides a new means to attend to ways that mimicry can both suppress the production of information and exacerbate systemic risk.",,,,,Public economics; Variety (cybernetics); Systemic risk; Externality; Economics; Herding; Production (economics); Incentive; Pooling; Subsidy,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399240 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399240,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399240,,,1587662471,,0,,1,False,,,lens

079-773-420-747-831,금융기관의 파산으로 인한 시스템 리스크의 발생에 관한 법률적 규제 -미국의 파산과 구제금융의 규제를 중심으로-,,2013.0,,,,,, 김병태,"The systemic risk regulation is a key measure for the safe and sound financial system and the prudential bank supervision. The goal of any financial regulatory system should be to enable well-functioning markets. Meeting this goal requires reducing the impact and frequency of financial institution failures that cause systemic risk. Any regulatory structure, however, inevitably involves tradeoffs. A policy that effectively reduces systemic risk and its associated costs might also increase moral hazard. Similarly, a policy that seeks to reduce moral hazard and maintain market discipline - for example, by allowing a large interconnected institution such as Lehman Brothers to fail - might also create uncertainty, which can harm markets by creating panic. In some parts, current regulatory structures in Korea and the U.S. are suboptimal in their regulations of the systemic risk. In the U.S. the federal government could strike a superior balance by establishing more stringent ex ante prudential regulations of systemically important non-bank financial institutions aimed at curbing excessive risk-taking and by implementing a regulatory process to resolve the failure of such institutions. The Dod-Frank Act by the Obama Administration has adopted regulatory reform that endorses such beneficial changes, but certain details in the proposal fall short. In Korea, it seems that the reforming financial regulations with respect to a systemic risk is required for troubled banks and non-banking institutions due to the shortcomings of our current regulatory structure and the ad hoc approach to rescuing TBTF non-bank financial institutions. A regulatory framework that more effectively contains systemic risk, avoids increasing moral hazard, and reduces excessive uncertainty caused by regulation. In this regards, it is noted that Korea should seek to optimize the ability to reduce systemic risk while minimizing the counterproductive results of moral hazard and uncertainty.",30,4,267,298,Finance; Ex-ante; Business; Systemic risk; Government; Regulatory reform; Harm; Financial institution; Moral hazard; Market discipline,,,,,http://kiss.kstudy.com/journal/thesis_name.asp?key=3186562,http://kiss.kstudy.com/journal/thesis_name.asp?key=3186562,,,2807411242,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The design of practical macroprudential policies to address such risks is complex. Issues to be tackled include: (a) statistics to accurately measure currency and maturity mismatches (which usually lie at the heart of EME crises) and the degree of leverage; (b) clarification of macroeconomic and financial system dynamics; (c) the selection of policy tools best suited for particular countries; and (d) quantification of the many dimensions of the “cycle”.

Scanlan,"In January of 2020, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manage with over seven trillion dollars under management at that time, announced it was placing environmental sustainability at the center of its investment approach because it had concluded that climate risk was investment risk. It warned of a very rapid movement of capital toward “sustainable” businesses. The coronavirus pandemic has intensified the appeal of sustainable investing. There is a push in the United States and the European Union to rethink the purpose of investor-owned corporations in light of the unprecedented need to deeply decarbonize the global economy and meet the Sustainable Development Goals on a very short timeframe. Without making substantive legal reforms, a common ground in this debate appears to be to reduce risks by promoting transparency and accountability. These values are aided by accurate and thorough reporting of a corporation’s environmental and social impacts, which facilitates investors’ ability to manage risk, and can inform broader public policy. Sustainability reporting also serves an internal purpose for boards of directors, alerting them about the effect the business is having on the environment and society, systemic risks, and ability of the company to achieve success in the long term. There is a growing awareness that a well-run company should have long-term plans charting its way toward environmental, social, and economic sustainability: the triple bottom line. One step in the direction of this call for transparency and accountability occurred in 2017 when the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive became effective. This new law requires EU publicly traded corporations and financial and insurance institutions with more than 500 employees to report on environmental, social, and governance metrics. Strategically increasing access to information holds promise because it moves corporate social responsibility out of the voluntary realm; but early results already indicate areas where the law needs to be improved. This Article will explain how the climate crisis places a new focus on the purpose of the corporation; private governance and voluntary sustainability reporting; and the new mandatory reporting approach in the EU, its limitations and potential reforms, and possible replication in the United States.",,,,,Finance; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Sustainable business; Sustainability reporting; European union; Corporate governance; Sustainable development; Triple bottom line; Sustainability,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3845060 https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/26256,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3845060,,,3136423845,,0,,0,False,,,lens
158-301-700-493-408,Derivatives Making a Comeback -- What Should We Know Post-Crisis?,2013-07-11,2013.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Sushmita Dharan,"With the economy showing signs of recovery, the exotic financial products are springing back.The demand for derivatives is once again growing as investors are trying to capitalize on the low interest rates. Notwithstanding the crisis, derivatives will continue to be useful and will serve as good hedging tools. The banks may continue to develop innovative products, even in a more regulated environment. At this juncture, it is important that the market entities take a step back to review the prevailing practicesBeing a former Structured Finance rating analyst of a leading Rating Agency in the years leading up to the crisis, I feel compelled to educate the readers on the intricacies of the market in the pre-crisis years. Since the financial crisis, I have been actively following the developments in the market and my efforts have been more geared toward studying the importance of risk assessment and its management. I have come to realize that the market, going forward, primarily needs a holistic view of risk tolerance. I am not writing this article with the intent of assigning responsibility for the crisis on any particular entity. However, as a former rating analyst, I consider myself uniquely placed to objectively present the idiosyncrasies of the market during this period. This should hopefully illustrate the importance of understanding risk to foster prudent investment decisions.As a professionally competent analyst within the group, I was viewed as one capable of analyzing complex and intricate CDO transactions with ease. I rated several hybrid CDOs that often times incorporated abstruse features, which were quite frankly, interesting to analyze. The increased risk appetite of the investors and the positive market sentiment encouraged the banks to come up with more complex derivative products. The period was marked by intense brainstorming sessions within the group. Everyone involved in the rating process was trying to get a grip on the features and their impact on the transaction ""deal"", in order to suitably incorporate them into the analyses. At this point, I wish to elucidate a few of the qualitative features that increased the complexity in rating these products, particularly the hybrid asset-backed CDOs:1. A large proportion of the CDOs' Collateral began having synthetic references in the form of CDS (credit default swaps). While this was widely prevalent even in the past years, the transactions leading up to the crisis predominantly referenced sub-prime mortgage backed securities. The ease of having assets in the portfolio without physically owning it and with no constraint on the notional amounts had become increasingly appealing. In order to account for the credit risk and the liquidity risk, these hybrid CDOs needed liabilities in the form of super-senior swap arrangements or note purchase agreements through a variable funding note. These agreements, while trying to shield the deal from having to take huge losses, were intended to also give regulatory-capital relief.2. The Issuer (the seller of protection) serviced its obligations on these swaps through the use of ""eligible collateral"" that took the form of GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contracts), TRS (Total Return Swaps), Repos, other highly rated liquid assets that also included triple-A rated structured finance obligations or a combination thereof.3. Sometimes the deals also comprised of a percentage of ""synthetic shorts"" where the Issuer, under this arrangement, was the protection buyer. The primary motivation for these types of securities was to partially hedge a long exposure. The deals even had naked (uncovered) shorts wherein the portfolio did not include any long credit exposure to the reference entity. This was intended to mitigate the overall credit risk associated with the long or cash portfolio. However, if the swaps have unintended consequences the deal could get over-leveraged.When one is evaluating a deal with all of the aforesaid features, which are only a few of the many, their aggregate impact further augments the complexity of the transaction. For a rating analyst, the analysis typically involved extensive review of swap agreements/confirmations in addition to the deal documents. The combined effect of multiple swap agreements to a transaction of this nature cannot be underestimated. The transactions also had complex cash-flow mechanisms ""waterfalls"" which needed be explicitly modeled in accordance with the agency's methodologies, while simultaneously accounting for the qualitative features. The robustness of the market necessitated appropriate methodology changes at the agencies. However the crisis has made it apparent that these changes did not totally account for the inherent risks in these securities. This could partly be attributed to the absence of sufficient historical data pertaining to the market at that time.The ramifications of these transactions on the market players, given their interconnectedness, have been humongous resulting in the financial crisis. The core of the crisis has only led us all to believe that the risks associated with these kinds of securities demanded a more in-depth understanding by the market.The rating agencies have understandably been under intense scrutiny by the market. Numerous other entities will also need to take responsibility for the fallout. As the growth in the Structured Finance market became rampant, the incentives for various players in the market started to get misaligned. As far as the rating analysts are concerned, there has always been a demand to churn deals out expeditiously. The analysts were rating a plethora of transactions prior to the crisis. These complex transactions were often tailored to meet the risk-return objectives of a specific class of investors that ironically possessed limited knowledge regarding these securities. To a certain extent, the proliferation of these complex transactions is consistent with over reliance on the rating agencies. Over-reliance without adequate fundamental analysis by the users can be detrimental. In order to make wise investment choices, the ratings need to serve as a complement to multiple data sources.The past few years since 2008 serve as abundant history, making it imperative for all concerned to take necessary actions to prevent such crises in the future. Regulators are making efforts through reforms to mitigate any potential crisis. The rating agencies need to continually review, revise and communicate their methodologies explicitly to the market. While there may not be a panacea for systemic risk, the effective way to mitigate risk will be through integrated efforts and cooperation among various market entities (structural, analytic and regulatory).",,,,,Structured finance; Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Credit default swap; Collateralized debt obligation; Swap (finance),,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2324304,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2324304,,,2235938870,,0,,0,False,,,lens

134-366-657-631-604,Macroprudential policy: from theory to implementation,,2014.0,,Financial Stability Review,,,,C. Noyer,"The crisis has demonstrated the need to renew our approach to financial system regulation and notably to complement it with a macroprudential perspective. There is no single definition of what constitutes “macroprudential” policy. There is, however, some consensus over its broad outlines. First, it involves adding a macroeconomic perspective to the supervision of the financial system, which up till now has only really been addressed from a “micro” standpoint. As the crisis has shown, financial stability does not depend solely on the soundness of the individual components that make up the financial system; it also depends on complex interactions and interdependencies between these components. Moreover, the term “macro” refers to the interactions between the real world and the financial world, to the extent that a risk only becomes “systemic” once the imbalances or shocks affecting the financial system pose a significant threat to economic activity. The second characteristic of macroprudential policy is that it is preventive.1 Its aim is precisely to prevent the formation of financial imbalances, procyclical phenomena or systemic risks by limiting excessive growth in credit and in economic agents’ debt levels, and increasing the shock-absorbing capacity of financial institutions or structures ex ante.2 Therefore, macroprudential policy is not designed to manage financial crises directly once they have erupted, but rather to prevent them from happening in the first place. The implementation of macroprudential policy poses a number of major challenges, particularly as many countries have only just put in place the necessary operational frameworks. In Europe, for instance, the CRD IV/CRR3 banking regulation package only came into force on 1 January 2014, while the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is due to become effective in November. The two texts, CRD IV and CRR, list the macroprudential tools that national authorities can use. If deemed necessary, these tools can in turn be tightened by the European Central Bank (ECB), which also has macroprudential responsibilities in addition to its microprudential role. Experience and analysis have shown that the successful implementation of macroprudential policy depends on three key factors: • the governance of that policy; • the identification of market failures and the selection of tools to combat them; • a proper understanding of the channels of transmission and of the way these tools interact with other economic policies, notably monetary, fiscal and microprudential policies.",,18,7,12,Debt; Macroeconomics; Systemic risk; Economics; Macro; Market failure; Interdependence; Corporate governance; Soundness; Financial system; Identification (information),,,,,https://www.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/publications/FSR18_Noyer.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/bfr/fisrev/20141801.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bfr:fisrev:2014:18:01,https://www.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/publications/FSR18_Noyer.pdf,,,97947989,,0,,3,False,,,lens
197-347-983-933-757,Danish Mortgage - in its 4th Century,2003-06-01,2003.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Jens Lunde,"Danish mortgage is in its 4th century. Bonds have been used for the funding always. Debt services just pass through the mortgage bank to the investors, at one of the biggest bond markets compared to GDP. The Danish capital market and the interest level are close connected to Euro land. Yet, national investors and especially pension funds dominate the market, where all types of owners raise mortgages for all properties. Economies of scale mean only few mortgage banks operate. Danish mortgage loans have low adjusted spreads. Traditionally, Danish mortgages have fixed interest with a prepayment option and debtors pay for the call option through a higher fixed interest rate. Over the decades, the market has experienced large amounts of gainful prepayments, latest and most significant in 1993-94. Prepayment activities occur after interest drops, while interest increases lead to re-buying of the bonds and refinancing at higher coupons. Since 1996, the fixed interest regime has been broken with a sudden violence by introduction of interest-adjusted mortgage loans, typical with fixed interest rates for 1, 2÷5 years and similar to US ARM- loans. Many debtors have refinanced fixed interest with adjusted interest rate loans. However, Danish debtors seem to ride the yield curve by raising loans in the short end, even at a very low interest level. This is opposite normal economic thinking. This development has changed interest risks and its consequence for credit risk. Especially newer owner-occupiers have a tense capital structure, also when mortgage debt is compared to property value. Therefore systemic risk and security for mortgage banks are important.",,,,,Financial economics; Prepayment of loan; Shared appreciation mortgage; Business; Mortgage bond; Secondary mortgage market; Floating interest rate; Mortgage underwriting; Monetary economics; Mortgage insurance; Cost of funds index,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arz:wpaper:eres2002_223,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arz:wpaper:eres2002_223,,,2199395341,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Esta politica criminal ha sido objeto de un amplio debate doctrinal, generalmente en terminos criticos, porque ha traido aparejado un significativo adelantamiento de la linea de defensa del Derecho Penal, con una flexibilizacion de las reglas de imputacion tradicionales y a costa de una relativizacion de los principios politico-criminales de garantia. Este trabajo reconoce a este nuevo Derecho Penal como expresion necesaria de la sociedad actual, tanto en lo que se refiere al control de riesgos sistemicos de naturaleza socioeconomica, como a la progresiva “individualizacion” del Derecho Penal, que proyecta una respuesta global a la culpabilidad por el hecho y a la peligrosidad de autor. No obstante, se llama la atencion acerca de las implicaciones eticas y dogmaticas de trasladar el paradigma del riesgo hacia la persona del autor, particularmente con el desarrollo que en el futuro puede tener la bioprediccion. La ampliacion del conocimiento sobre las bases neurobiologicas del comportamiento criminal, combinada con la idea de “peligro para los demas” puede derivar tambien en una ampliacion de las obligaciones de control y en una redefinicion ‘individual’ del riesgo permitido y, en consecuencia, en una ampliacion del ambito de la responsabilidad penal sobre la base de ser “garante de uno mismo”. EnglishIn recent years, Criminal Law has been undergoing an ""expansion"" and ""modernization"" process, epitomized by a clear shift of paradigm towards the idea of risk and risk assessment. Moreover, the focus on risk has included, not only the dangerousness of the defendant’s behaviour, but also the danger from within the agent himself (individual characteristics). This criminal policy has been discussed by academics extensively, generally in critical terms, because it has brought with it a significant shifts towards an earlier response by the Criminal Law (actus reus) and more laxed criteria for legal responsibility (mens rea), at the expense of relativisation of the fundamental guaranties. In this paper, this new Criminal Law is considered as a necessary expression of current society, both with regards to the control of socioeconomic systemic risks, and the progressive ""individualization"" of Criminal Law. This represents a global response to culpability based on facts as well as the dangerousness of the agent. However, I also draw attention towards the ethical and dogmatic implications of transferring the risk paradigm towards the person of the defendant. Particularly, considering the potential consequences of relying on bio-prediction. The advances in the understanding of the neurobiological roots of criminal behaviour, combined with the idea of being a ""danger to others"", may lead to an increased expectation of control of one’s own risk and an ""individualised” redefinition of the “permitted risk” and, consequently, to an extension of the criminal responsibility on the basis of each individual being the “guarantor of oneself”.",,13,139,157,Mens rea; Humanities; Derecho; Linea; Actus reus; Political science; Criminal law; Culpability; Criminal policy; Persona,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6859390 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6859390.pdf,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6859390,,,2942305790,,0,,0,False,,,lens
078-618-746-381-423,The Role of Banks in Asset Securitization,2012-07-01,2012.0,journal article,Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic policy review,,,,Nicola Cetorelli; Stavros Peristiani,"1. INTRODUCTION It is probably safe to assume that Frank Capra's intentions in his classic film It's a Wonderful Life were to exalt the fundamental virtues of the human character and to caution us against the perils of material temptations. And yet, almost seventy years later, his film remains one of the best portrayals in Hollywood cinematic history of the role and importance of banks in the real economy. This film could easily be used in a classroom to describe a traditional model of financial intermediation centered on banks, defined here as deposit-taking institutions predominantly engaged in lending. (1) The typical bank of the 1940s is embodied in the film's Bailey Building and Loan Association, a thrift institution that takes deposits and invests them in construction loans that allow the local residents to disentangle themselves from the clutches of the greedy monopolist, Henry F. Potter. We also see a bank run developing, and we learn of banks' intrinsic fragility when George Bailey, the film's main character and the manager of the thrift, explains to panicked clients demanding withdrawals that their money is not in a safe on the premises, but rather is, figuratively speaking, ""in Joe's house ... that's right next to yours."" The film debuted in 1946, but Bailey's bank has remained the dominant model of banking throughout the decades that followed. Indeed, it is by and large the model that has inspired the supervisory and regulatory approach to financial intermediation, at least until recent times. Because of the significant social externalities associated with banks' activities, close monitoring of the banks' books is warranted in order to minimize the risk of systemic events (there is indeed even room for a bank examiner in the film!). However, if we were to remake the film and fit it into the current context, many of the events would need significant adaptation. For instance, we could still have the bank, but it would be an anachronism to retain the idea that depositors' money is in their neighbors' houses. Most likely, the modern George Bailey would have taken the loans and passed them through a ""whole alphabet soup of levered-up nonbank investment conduits, vehicles, and structures,"" as McCulley (2007) incisively puts it when describing financial intermediation's evolution to a system now centered around the securitization of assets. Under the securitization model, lending constitutes not the end point in the allocation of funds, but the beginning of a complex process in which loans are sold into legally separate entities, only to be aggregated and packaged into multiple securities with different characteristics of risk and return that will appeal to broad investor classes. And those same securities can then become the inputs of further securitization activities. The funding dynamics of such activities diverge from the traditional, deposit-based model in several ways. Securitization structures develop the potential for separate funding mechanisms, such as issuance of commercial paper backed by the securitized assets. And the creation of these new classes of securities fuels the growth of other nonbank-centered, secured intermediation transactions, such as repurchase agreements and securities lending, in need of what Gorton (2010) calls ""informationally insensitive"" collateral. Under such a complex configuration, traditional banks may no longer be needed, as we witness the rise of what McCulley--apparently the first to do so--calls ""shadow banks."" The goal of our article is to delve more deeply into the analysis of asset securitization activity in order to address the following fundamental question: Have regulated bank entities become increasingly marginalized as intermediation has moved off the banks' balance sheets and into the shadows? Aside from the insights gained, furthering our understanding of the evolution of financial intermediation has first-order normative implications: If regulated banks are less central to intermediation and if intermediation is a potential source of systemic risk, then a diminished bank-based system would require a significant rethinking of both the monitoring and regulatory fields. …",,,47,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Collateral; Intermediation; Securities lending; Securitization; Repurchase agreement; Financial intermediary; Financial system; Bank run,,,,,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/12v18n2/1207peri.pdf https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-301180663/the-role-of-banks-in-asset-securitization,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-301180663/the-role-of-banks-in-asset-securitization,,,238359584,,0,137-103-177-601-902,34,False,,,lens

As we move into a cashless era, it is essential that we develop new economic tools that are capable of leveraging these technologies whilst measuring their impact. Without a means of measurement, it would not be possible to come up with a new theory of capitalism or, as the author states, a buffet of theories. What is required is not a universal law of capitalism but a nuanced selection of theories that are based on different scenarios. As standard tools are illsuited to this task of multiple scenario constructions based on the actions of multiple market players, the author makes the case that the solution lies in borrowing from the learnings of complexity science and the emerging discipline of complexity economics. By providing a vulgarized introduction to the subject, the reader is informed about the new tools and frameworks that need to be constructed to gauge and govern this system. Thus, the reader will be introduced to the principles and models of Econophysics and Complexity Economics, which offer greater mathematical exactitude and a higher probability of identifying systemic risk than current economic models.",,,155,225,Universal law; Economic model; Neoclassical economics; Systemic risk; Political science; Complexity economics; Witness; Subject (philosophy); Econophysics; Capitalism; Economic system,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-2674-2_4/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-2674-2_4 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-2674-2_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-2674-2_4,,10.1007/978-1-4842-2674-2_4,2592606365,,0,,0,False,,,lens
158-245-217-725-682,Three Essays on Finanical Economics,,2015.0,dissertation,,,,,Yi-An Chen,"This thesis discusses network risk and its implications for financial economics. A stock’s tendency to co-move with its related stocks is defined as network risk. In the first chapter, I propose a new econometric procedure to estimate network risk using a factor model and show that network risk is not negligible in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The second chapter examines the pricing of network risk in the cross section of stock expected returns. Using the Fama-McBeth regression, I show that a newly-derived network volatility component of idiosyncratic volatility, termed NVOL, was priced with a 1.01 percent monthly premium between Sep. 1967 and Dec. 2012. This finding suggests a risk-based explanation of the equity premium: Stocks are compensated for risk that arises from shocks to networks that contain them. Finally, the third chapter summarizes various systemic risk measures developed after the financial crisis in 2008. These measures are classified into four categories: (1) Tail dependence; (2) Default probability; (3) Network measure; and (4) Others based on their approach and data required. Robust-yet-Fragile property which is one of the characteristics of a modern financial system is identified as a key to understanding the cascade effects of systemic risk. Network based systemic risk models have great potential to capture this property, both theoretically and empirically.",,,,,Equity premium puzzle; Financial economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Tail dependence; Financial crisis; Financial risk management; Stock (geology); Regression; Volatility (finance),,,,,https://digital.lib.washington.edu:443/researchworks/handle/1773/33729,https://digital.lib.washington.edu:443/researchworks/handle/1773/33729,,,2564614870,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Nadarajah; Chee Kon; Sal Rassam,"Purpose To assess the visual outcome after massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage managed by early controlled drainage using the aid of an intravitreal expanding gas bubble (100% perfluoropropane). The ocular and systemic risk factors were also reviewed. Methods Data were obtained retrospectively from patients with massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage who were treated in Worthing and Southlands National Health Service Trust between January 2003 and December 2008. Results The study included 10 patients (5 women and 5 men) with a mean age of 73.9 years (range, 54-84 years). All patients underwent early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 100% perfluoropropane as a tamponade. The mean interval of drainage from the onset was 3.5 days (range, 1-10 days). Anatomical restoration of ocular structures was achieved in 7 patients, with good final visual outcome at mean 9 months (range, 6-14 months). The remaining three patients had poor visual outcome because of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The most common risk factor in this case series was glaucoma, which was seen in five patients. Arteriosclerosis was the only risk factor in two patients. Conclusion Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with 100% perfluoropropane tamponade may help in achieving a good visual outcome. The use of 100% perfluoropropane has the advantage of maintaining positive pressure while facilitating controlled drainage of the hemorrhage as the clot lyses. Retinal detachment however is a poor prognostic indicator.

Systemic risks are risks that threaten the systems upon which society depends, including ecosystems, social systems, financial systems, and systems of infrastructure. Such risks are typically characterised by inherent complexity, profound uncertainty, and overwhelming ambiguity. In combination, these features pose significant regulatory challenges for policy and law-makers. Examining how different types of systemic risks caused by climate change are being regulated in four different jurisdictions – the EU, the UK, the US and Australia – this book identifies deficiencies associated with regulating systemic risks using a traditional approach, based on a linear relationship between risk and regulation, which is widely used to regulate risk. The book advances a regulatory approach that is, instead, founded on the concept of ""risk governance"". This involves a structured yet flexible, holistic, interdisciplinary and inclusive basis for responding to systemic risks; and it is, this book argues, a more effective basis for regulating systemic risks given their uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. This book will appeal to academics, policy and law-makers and practitioners working at the intersection of law and policy in the areas of regulation, risk management and climate change.",,,,,Systemic risk; Ambiguity; Corporate governance; Resilience (materials science); Appeal; Psychological resilience; Climate change; Precautionary principle; Political science; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk management; Risk governance; Business; Law and economics; Environmental planning; Environmental resource management; Economics; Law; Financial crisis; Geography; Computer science; Psychology; Ecology; Physics; Finance; Biology; Psychotherapist; Macroeconomics; Programming language; Thermodynamics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003253464,,10.4324/9781003253464,,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Supervisory and other competent authorities have discovered that they have only limited ways of preventing an idiosyncratic shock in one institution from turning into a system-wide shock and of stopping the contagion spreading to other domestic and foreign financial institutions. This article aims to draw attention to the risks associated with the existence of systemically important financial institutions. It discusses methods for identifying systemically important financial institutions, including the approach proposed by BCBS (2011b), which is applied to the Czech banking system for illustration. Overall, our systemic importance results show that there is a large number of normally important financial institutions on average and a very small number of more important institutions. Moreover, there is high variance among the most important institutions in the results. In connection with the newly proposed regulation, the article presents possible instruments for increasing the resilience of such institutions to systemic risk.",,,100,111,Finance; Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Political science; Variance (accounting); Institution; Shock (economics); Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cnb:ocpubc:fsr1112/1 http://www.cnb.cz/en/financial_stability/fs_reports/fsr_2011-2012/fsr_2011-2012_article_i.pdf,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cnb:ocpubc:fsr1112/1,,,2234747201,,0,003-803-424-332-155; 024-769-618-385-760; 026-368-711-109-491; 031-145-604-912-345; 047-525-829-454-571; 064-299-895-727-973; 069-158-209-730-738; 075-467-416-799-558; 091-195-987-002-438; 097-906-494-156-814; 107-088-041-853-560; 114-040-754-453-568; 119-542-279-243-730; 150-347-168-528-987; 159-558-512-459-149; 162-303-893-367-451,3,False,,,lens

We measure the marginal contributions of each bank to systemic risk by computing the delta Conditional Value at Risk which measures the difference between system risk of individual banks when they are in a normal state and when they are in distress state. Using daily stock market closing prices of six South African banking banks from 19 June 2007 to 11 April 2016; our back tested systemic risk measures suggest that the contribution of South African banks to systemic risk tends to significantly increase during periods of financial crises. The two largest banks namely First Rand Bank and Standard Bank are found to be the highest contributors to systemic risk while the smallest bank namely African Bank is found to be the least contributor to the overall systemic risk in South African banking sector. Based on the delta Conditional Value at Risk; we show that there is a need to go beyond micro prudential regulation in order to sustain stability in the South African banking sector.,,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Prudential regulation; Stock market; Normal state; Banking sector; Expected shortfall; Quantile regression; Financial system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/rza/wpaper/709.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/rza/wpaper/709.html,,,3122444499,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The focus of the thesis will be specifically on reform of the regulatory and the supervisory framework aimed at mitigating the effects of systemic risk. The starting point will be a review of the literature on the concept of systemic risk which will demonstrate that its unpredictable nature requires a malleable regulatory response. In light of the suggested areas of concern by the pivotal ‘de Larosiere report’, analysis will be provided on the progress achieved so far. On the regulatory front, the systemic risk aspects of the various legislative measures introduced are assessed in terms of their relevance and potential effectiveness. The reformed supervisory framework under the new European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) requires close scrutiny due to the transfer of power to centralised authorities. Although the reform should be considered a success in terms of reaching its objectives in a timely manner, some critiques and suggestions will be provided on how to carry the framework forward. The thesis will also argue that taking the framework to the next step may require testing the boundaries of European Treaties and its case law in relation to delegation of powers. The measured success of the new framework could however be jeopardised by the recent introduction of the first steps towards a banking union in the Eurozone. By creating a new supervisory dynamic within the EU, it will be argued that such a move raises the potential of creating a ‘two speed’ model of financial supervision in the EU. Additionally it risks polarising the supervisory debate between the European Central Bank and the Bank of England at the detriment of the EU.",,,,,Economic policy; Accounting; Systemic risk; Relevance (law); Common law; Political science; Scrutiny; Banking union; European union; Legislature; Delegation,,,,,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/51062/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.668265,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/51062/,,,2307646748,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Lo,"Systemic risk is commonly used to describe the possibility of a series of correlated defaults among financial institutions---typically banks---that occur over a short period of time, often caused by a single major event. However, since the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, it has become clear that hedge funds are also involved in systemic risk exposures. The hedge-fund industry has a symbiotic relationship with the banking sector, and many banks now operate proprietary trading units that are organized much like hedge funds. As a result, the risk exposures of the hedge-fund industry may have a material impact on the banking sector, resulting in new sources of systemic risks. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the potential impact of hedge funds on systemic risk by developing a number of new risk measures for hedge funds and applying them to individual and aggregate hedge-fund returns data. These measures include: illiquidity risk exposure, nonlinear factor models for hedge-fund and banking-sector indexes, logistic regression analysis of hedge-fund liquidation probabilities, and aggregate measures of volatility and distress based on regime-switching models. Our preliminary findings suggest that the hedge-fund industry may be heading into a challenging period of lower expected returns, and that systemic risk is currently on the rise.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)",,,235,338,Factor analysis; Business; Systemic risk; Logistic regression; Actuarial science; Hedge fund; Proprietary trading; Term (time); Default; Volatility (finance),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/11200.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/11200.html,,,3125242883,,0,,92,False,,,lens

Levy,"Leverage entails a unique set of risks, such as margin calls, which can force investors to liquidate securities at adverse prices. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) fails to account for these unique risks. Investors often use portfolio optimization with a leverage constraint to mitigate the risks of leverage, but MPT provides no guidance as to where to set the leverage constraint. Fortunately, MPT can be fixed by explicitly incorporating a term for investor leverage aversion, as well as volatility aversion, allowing each investor to determine the right amount of leverage given that investor’s preferred trade-offs between expected return, volatility risk and leverage risk. Incorporating leverage aversion into the portfolio optimization process produces portfolios that better reflect investor preferences. Furthermore, to the extent that portfolio leverage levels are reduced, systemic risk in the financial system may also be reduced.",2,3,113,126,Economics; Microeconomics; Portfolio optimization; Leverage (negotiation); Volatility risk; Margin (finance); Portfolio; Efficient frontier; Risk aversion; Modern portfolio theory,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ris/jofipe/0056.html,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ris/jofipe/0056.html,,,3121615177,,0,,2,False,,,lens

Our analysis presents not only current levels of domestic systemic importance of individual banks but also the changes. We also consider the systemic risk of the whole banking system, by investigating how D-SIBs and non-D-SIBs are correlated before and after the recent financial crises using Copula. We find that the systemic importance of major banks is decreasing, while some banks becoming more systemically important should require tight regulations. D-SIBs as a whole subsystem display stronger correlation with non-D-SIBs than the individual D-SIBs, which alerts the regulatory to pay attention to “too-many-to-fail” problems. Contagion effects between D-SIBs and non-D-SIBs exist during the subprime crisis, but did not exist during the European debt crisis.

METHODS--Ten normal volunteers, whose ages ranged from 17 to 34 years, performed RB over 135 to 260 seconds (mean (SD) 193 (38) seconds) while retinal macular blood velocity was determined non-invasively using the blue field simulation technique. RESULTS--Leucocyte velocity significantly increased (p < 0.05) at 2 minutes and at the end of RB by 53% (42%) and 92% (65%), respectively (95% confidence interval of the mean (CIM)). All subjects observed an increase in the density of leucocytes. At the end of RB, mean systolic brachial arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly increased by 24% (11%) and 37% (15%) respectively (p < 0.01). At 2 minutes, end tidal oxygen concentration in the exhaled air was 47% (8%) (95% CIM) below and carbon dioxide was 41% (16%) above baseline (p < 0.001). The RB produces a large increase in macular leucocyte velocity, suggesting an increase in blood flow.

The formation of the guarantee circle makes the originally unconnected companies closely interdependent, which means the operational risk of an enterprise in the circle will be transmitted layer by layer along the guarantee chain and eventually lead to systemic risks in the industry or even in a region. The market supervision and management department should supervise whether the contracting parties in the guaranteed network are in a state of ""tripartite confrontation."" Once negative effects are triggered, they will affect not only the company’s performance but also opportunistic behaviors in the market and even economic foresight. This paper proposes a risk assessment model based on a graph neural network. This model employs the community discovery algorithm and graph neural network to extract a large number of guarantee data from the original table representing ""see-to-it"" guarantee, principal and collateral relationships of guarantee and start time. Then takes the guarantee subject as a node and traverses the community labels of all neighbors, so as to, convert it into a guaranteed network and use the model established based on the graph neural network to rate its risk. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is effective and practical for identifying special guarantee circles, and that it can be utilized as a reference in extracting topology network structure and detecting the community structure of the static graph.",,,,,Computer science; Artificial neural network; Interdependence; Graph; Futures studies; Artificial intelligence; Theoretical computer science; Political science; Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/eiect58010.2022.00083,,10.1109/eiect58010.2022.00083,,,0,000-203-627-584-442; 015-692-170-714-052; 018-814-147-267-436; 034-803-777-710-814; 053-014-679-119-593; 055-638-170-533-220; 061-937-306-150-542; 063-190-811-897-241,0,False,,,lens

Omarova,"This article seeks to broaden the scope of the ongoing debate on financial regulation reform by making a case for reinventing industry self-regulation on a fundamentally new normative basis. The article argues that, in the face of the increasing complexity and globalization of financial markets and activities, it is critically important to seriously consider the potential role of industry self-regulation as one of the key mechanisms of controlling and minimizing systemic risk – a task that is not adequately performed by the existing financial industry self-regulatory organizations (SROs). The article suggests a new normative approach to self-regulation in the financial services sector – “embedded self-regulation” – which focuses explicitly on prevention of systemic failure and is firmly embedded in the broader public interests and policy goals. This new self-regulatory model will seek to redefine the broader social role of the private financial sector and to impose the primary responsibility for safeguarding financial stability directly on the financial services industry whose activities threaten such stability.",35,3,2,,Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Globalization; Safeguarding; Scope (project management); Market economy; Normative; Financial regulation,,,,,https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2489&context=facpub https://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1145&context=bjil https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1022/,https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1022/,,,3124970454,,0,,8,False,,,lens

However, the financial crisis showed that monetary policy and prudential supervision deeply affect each other and that an overly strict separation might generate systemic risk. As a consequence, the prevalent model of ""functional separation"" - central banking and financial supervision in separate entities - has been questioned and calls for a more holistic approach increased. This policy letter states that from a legal perspective, such a holistic approach would be in conformity with the current legal framework of the Economic and Monetary Union. Although the realization of a holistic approach might intensify the doubts of democratic legitimation under the framework of the ESCB, the independence of the ECB should not be given up. As viable alternatives to protect monetary policy against the time inconsistency problem that would render central bank independence moot do not seem to be available and given the great importance of the independence of the European institutions for the European integration, the democratic control over the ECB should be strengthened instead of stripping the ECB of its independence.",,,,,Monetary policy; Dynamic inconsistency; Systemic risk; Economics; European integration; Economic and monetary union; Independence; Financial crisis; Democracy; Financial system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/safepl/63.html https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/172554 https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/172554/1/1010350943.pdf,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/safepl/63.html,,,2796830864,,0,,0,False,,,lens

198-822-828-472-643,The Foundations of Banks' Risk Regulation: a Review of the Literature,,2003.0,,,,,,Georges Dionne,"The stability of the banking industry around the world has been observed as periodical since the Great Depression. Financial markets have changed dramatically over the last twenty-five years, introducing more competition for and from banks. Banks are the financial institutions responsible for providing liquidity to the economy. This responsibility is, however, the main cause of their fragility. Deposit insurance is the most efficient instrument for protecting depositors and for preventing bank runs. Pricing deposit insurance according to the individual bank's risk seems to be the most appropriate strategy but it does not seem to be sufficient in the sense that it seems to remain residual information problems in the market, although there is no appropriate statistical analysis on this issue. In 1988, the G10 modified banking regulation significantly by setting capital standards for international banks. These standards have now been adopted by more than one hundred countries as part of their national regulation of banks' risk. Current regulation of bank capital adequacy has its critics because it imposes the same rules on all banks. This seems particularly unsuitable when applied to credit risk which is the major source of a bank's risk (about 70%). Moreover, diversification of a bank's credit-risk portfolio is not taken into account in the computation of capital ratios. These shortcomings seem to have distorted the behaviour of banks and this makes it much more complicated to monitor them. In fact, it is not even clear that the higher capital ratios observed since the introduction of this new form of capital regulation necessarily lower risks. Additional reform is expected in 2004, but there is as yet no consensus on othe form it will take nor on whether it will suitably regulate banks in individual countries. Consequently, it might be appropriate to continue developing national regualtion based on optimal deposit insurance (with individual insurance pricing and continuous auditing on individual risk) and to keep searching for other optimal complementary instruments for use against systemic risk, instruments suitably designed to fit the banking industry's peculiar structure. Other market discipline (such as subordinated debt) and governance instruments may be more efficient than the current capital requirement scheme for the banks' commitment problem associated to deposit insurance. The central bank should be responsible for aggregate liquidity. Confidence inthe financial sector is a public good that must be ensured by the government. Who should be in charge: the central bank or a regulatory agency? The revised literature seems to say that this role should be taken by a regulatory agency independent fromthe central bank and independent from the political power.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Diversification (finance); Market liquidity; Deposit insurance; Market discipline; Capital requirement; Financial system; Bank run,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/lacicr/0346.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/lacicr/0346.html,,,3122560528,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Based on a combination of univariate and multivariate Cox regressions, our approach is applied to 2006–2010 data of 171 listed US financial companies (grouped in two subsamples, S&P and Non-S&P), on which we estimate different versions of nine popular systematic and systemic risk measures, along with leverage as control variable. Results reveal a strong prevalence of systemic measures and leverage over systematic ones, especially when the time distance between the indicator and the event tends to increase. For the S&P companies, a combination of SRisk and leverage provides a considerable improvement over the best stand-alone indicators, while Expected Shortfall emerges as the only systematic measure providing some information in addition to SRisk and leverage for Non-S&P companies.",58,,316,332,Business; Systemic risk; Leverage (statistics); Control variable; Multivariate statistics; Actuarial science; Univariate; Proportional hazards model; Expected shortfall; Systematic risk,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/empfin/v58y2020icp316-332.html https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1200424 https://flore.unifi.it/bitstream/2158/1200424/1/Preproof_Journal%20of%20empirical%20finance_.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927539820300360,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jempfin.2020.06.005,,10.1016/j.jempfin.2020.06.005,3038274279,,0,000-262-589-723-439; 000-846-266-307-085; 001-274-723-652-948; 011-321-200-315-549; 019-198-557-184-238; 023-920-010-872-504; 036-760-762-204-068; 038-742-900-699-577; 048-363-026-036-293; 049-755-378-251-869; 055-018-348-961-146; 055-375-800-335-754; 056-084-592-994-224; 061-455-144-581-099; 063-329-652-421-660; 063-528-700-755-609; 064-168-339-463-946; 067-160-857-197-994; 075-312-298-223-69X; 084-090-075-592-338; 104-848-222-783-75X; 106-037-261-198-688; 115-806-665-215-624; 116-050-157-238-327; 119-031-570-848-300; 122-779-428-131-390; 134-548-354-615-84X; 153-779-195-390-459; 168-422-163-339-942; 168-452-784-415-861; 181-329-947-787-756; 183-050-092-896-846,2,True,,green,lens

Chaffee,"The most recent global financial crisis resulted in part from a failure of international law. Politicians and other regulators in the United States and abroad failed to effectively work together to create a consistent and proper level of regulation for the financial institutions, the mortgage-backed securities, and the credit default swaps that were at the heart of the crisis. As evidenced by the crisis, the globalization of financial markets within the past few decades has created new systemic risk in which national crises can quickly and easily spread across national borders. In the absence of greater coordination by politicians and other regulators in the United States and abroad, global financial crises are likely to occur with greater regularity and severity as the world continues to become more interconnected.Even if a cohesive web of international financial regulation can be developed, enforcement of the various strands of that web of regulation remains a concern. Remarkably, anti-corruption law has largely been ignored as a necessary component of financial regulatory reform. In the voluminous body of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the term “corruption” is not mentioned once, which is extraordinarily troubling.A robust and comprehensive system of transnational anti-corruption law is required to create stable global financial markets. The realities of an increasingly interconnected world precipitated the enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to prevent persons and other entities from engaging in activity that would corrupt foreign government officials. The OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, and various other international agreements have helped to spread transnational anti-corruption laws throughout the rest of the world. The adoption and enforcement of these laws, however, remains incomplete. In the absence of a robust and comprehensive system of transnational anti-corruption laws, the global financial markets remain subject to greater risk of future financial crises.

Burgess; Deborah M Broadbent; Marta García-Fiñana; Irene M Stratton; Ticiana Criddle; Amu Wang; Ayesh Alshukri; Mehrdad Mobayen Rahni; Pilar Vazquez-Arango; Jiten Vora; Simon P. Harding,"AIMS Systematic annual screening to detect sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) is established in the United Kingdom. We designed an observational cohort study to provide up-to-date data for policy makers and clinical researchers on incidence of key screening endpoints in people with diabetes attending one screening programme running for over 30 years. METHODS All people with diabetes aged ≥12 years registered with general practices in the Liverpool health district were offered inclusion. Data sources comprised: primary care (demographics, systemic risk factors), Liverpool Diabetes Eye Screening Programme (retinopathy grading), Hospital Eye Services (slit lamp biomicroscopy assessment of screen positives). RESULTS 133,366 screening episodes occurred in 28,384 people over 11 years. Overall incidences were: screen positive 6.7% (95% CI 6.5-6.8), screen positive for retinopathy 3.1% (3.0-3.1), unassessable images 2.6% (2.5-2.7), other significant eye diseases 1.0% (1.0-1.1). 1.6% (1.6-1.7) had sight-threatening retinopathy confirmed by slit lamp biomicroscopy. The annual incidence of screen positive and screen positive for retinopathy showed consistent declines from 8.8%-10.6% and 4.4%-4.6% in 2007/09 to 4.4%-6.8% and 2.3%-2.9% in 2013/17, respectively. Rates of STDR (true positive) were consistently below 2% after 2008/09. Screen positive rates were higher in first time attenders (9.9% [9.4-10.2] vs. 6.1% [6.0-6.2]) in part due to ungradeable images (4.1% vs. 2.3%) and other eye disease (2.4% vs. 0.8%). 4.5% (3.9-5.2) of previous non-attenders had sight-threatening retinopathy. Compared with people with type 2 diabetes, those with type 1 disease demonstrated higher rates of screen positive (11.9% vs. 6.0%) and STDR (6.4% vs. 1.2%). Overall prevalence of any retinopathy was 27.2% (27.0-27.4). CONCLUSIONS In an established screening programme with a stable population screen, positive rates show a consistent fall over time to a low level. Of those who are screen positive, fewer than 50% are screen positive for diabetic retinopathy. Most are due to sight threatening maculopathy.

Major countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America collapsed or fell prey to the contagiousness of the crisis. It all started in Thailand in the summer of 1997, quickly spread to other South-East Asian countries, dragged down Japan, infested Russia and spread to Latin America. The starting point in South East Asia is all the more remarkable as these economies were admired world-wide for their achievements and the World Bank – surely a very involved and knowledgeable institution – wondered in a publication of 1993 about explanations for the ""Asian miracle"". And, indeed, these countries had accomplished the miracle of lifting themselves out of poverty during the last 20 –30 years. Their success was sustained for several decades. And this success was achieved despite or because of, a social organisation in opposition to Western values: all these countries had limited democracy and, instead, substantial oligarchic structures with widespread corruption and extensive import protection and state involvement. But they were successful. Hence the search for ""Asian values"" to understand the ""Asian miracle"". Had the crisis –with a major financial turmoil including currency collapse, widespread bankruptcy of the banking and corporate sector, drop in GDP – been linked to Asia one could have argued that special Asian factors (excessively rapid growth, corruption, fixed exchange rates, etc…) were at work. But in the meantime the list of victims of financial turmoil lengthened: Russia, Brazil, Argentina and Turkey. And whilst Korea and Malaysia came out of the crisis relatively unscathed, Indonesia is still on the brink. Are there lessons to be drawn? The first lesson of the crisis is that there is much more systemic risk than previously admitted. In 1997 and 1998 lenders and investors had reconsidered emerging market risk as a whole and changed tack abruptly, without a clear change in fundamentals. The second is that the IMF's surveillance does not work as well as assumed and that the IMF has difficulties in effectively stemming an unfolding crisis. The world markets have become more global, but international institutions have not kept pace. The official mission of the IMF is to assist countries with a balance of payments problem. But in fact the IMF is expected to carry out surveillance to prevent financial crises and their spreading to other countries and to assist countries with international liquidity problems. It would be unreasonable to expect the IMF to deal well with all these expectations for which it was not set up. This paper argues that the IMF, more often than not, has made the severity of a crisis worse.",,,61,72,Finance; Balance of payments; Emerging markets; Currency; Systemic risk; Economics; Poverty; Corruption; Carry (investment); Asian values; Development economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ers/journl/vivy2001i1-2p61-72.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ers:journl:v:iv:y:2001:i:1-2:p:61-72,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ers/journl/vivy2001i1-2p61-72.html,,,2278941704,,0,165-184-240-130-000,0,False,,,lens

The objective is to model the boiling state of the Greek local financial market before the peak of the Sovereign Debt Crisis of Eurozone in 2009, modelling the insights of foreign investors and credit rating organizations. We will identify a set of primary risk factors and their effect on both the local economy and the markets involved to validate the analysis done. In this paper will use both statistical analysis and macroeconomic data modelling techniques to identify a set of primary risk factors or economic variables and their effect on both the local economy of Greece and the markets involved. The selected method of modeling is Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models. The research is based on the data provided by World Bank Data Portal. Results obtained are fitted of 2006-2009 years data Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models, forecasting market volatility in 2010 and on. We have discovered, that the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average model is not suitable for this problem as there was no notable autocorrelation. The volatility seems to fade out. This observation coincides with reality, as the crisis is about to peak and descend. Systemic risk indicators, primarily used for forecasting state-wide risk, are usually built on insider data of rating agencies or financial institutions. In this paper we obtain results close to Systemic Stress Indicator provided by European Central Bank (ECB) using ARCH and GARCH models on public data. The practical importance is model generation principle, which allows creating a risk indicator based on public financial data.

Kim; Andrew W. Lo,"Abstract We apply machine-learning techniques to construct nonlinear nonparametric forecasting models of consumer credit risk. By combining customer transactions and credit bureau data from January 2005 to April 2009 for a sample of a major commercial bank’s customers, we are able to construct out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R2’s of forecasted/realized delinquencies of 85%. Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses. Moreover, the time-series patterns of estimated delinquency rates from this model over the course of the recent financial crisis suggest that aggregated consumer credit-risk analytics may have important applications in forecasting systemic risk.",34,11,2767,2787,Nonparametric statistics; Cost–benefit analysis; Business; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Credit risk; Financial crisis; Sample (statistics); Default; Analytics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v34y2010i11p2767-2787.html http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426610002372 https://dspace.mit.edu/openaccess-disseminate/1721.1/66301 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426610002372 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jbfina:v:34:y:2010:i:11:p:2767-2787 http://bigdata.csail.mit.edu/sites/bigdata/files/sites/Lo%20JBF%20Pub%20abstract%20and%20paper.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3301009 https://core.ac.uk/download/4430264.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2010.06.001,,10.1016/j.jbankfin.2010.06.001,3121588992,,3,001-743-298-233-863; 003-978-064-785-082; 006-662-666-628-20X; 016-604-899-582-932; 017-303-774-495-787; 018-835-513-079-324; 020-210-148-858-064; 022-798-033-152-793; 024-774-328-031-872; 027-159-278-727-98X; 031-056-855-501-837; 031-967-529-225-926; 036-033-034-617-146; 038-570-054-764-254; 044-957-086-143-78X; 050-555-349-610-85X; 060-597-064-924-757; 060-833-748-323-575; 062-051-558-006-17X; 066-510-438-649-272; 069-688-041-014-348; 073-217-933-163-035; 079-709-514-273-431; 081-835-976-881-174; 084-120-576-759-188; 085-062-602-338-832; 089-098-407-824-325; 095-563-603-963-814; 122-669-242-227-514; 129-419-787-523-068; 134-809-510-396-734; 139-150-883-244-804; 142-240-884-433-882; 144-646-459-708-665; 145-521-569-463-475; 153-616-529-485-882; 157-232-707-610-192; 164-052-475-216-633,434,True,cc-by-nc-sa,green,lens

Fortunately, there is a growing research agenda and more financial regulators, central bankers, and academics have recently been focusing on this field. In this chapter, the authors obtain a distribution of losses for the banking system as a whole. They are convinced that such distribution of losses is the key element that could be used to develop relevant measures for systemic risk. Their model contemplates several aspects, which they consider important regarding the concept of systemic risk: an initial macroeconomic shock, which weakens some institutions (some of them to the point of failure), a contagion process by means of the interbank market, and the resulting losses to the financial system as a whole. Finally, once the distribution is estimated, the authors derive standard risk measures for the system as a whole, focusing on the tail of the distribution (where the catastrophic or systemic events are located). By using the proposed framework, it is also possible to perform stress testing in a coherent way, including second round effects like contagion through the interbank market. Additionally, it is possible to follow the evolution of certain coherent risk measures, like the CVaR, in order to evaluate if the system is becoming more or less risky, in fact, more or less fragile. Additionally, the authors decompose the distribution of losses of the whole banking system into the systemic and the contagion elements and determine if the system is more prone to experience contagious difficulties during a certain period of time.</jats:p>",,,282,310,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Financial contagion; Stress testing (software),,,,,https://www.bis.org/events/srbbrobc100318/agenda/mllpa_pres.pdf https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/systemic-risk-stress-testing-and-financial-contagion/115334,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-6268-1.ch015,,10.4018/978-1-4666-6268-1.ch015,2478463320,,0,001-355-306-290-901; 002-027-500-855-279; 009-415-234-495-061; 009-891-534-271-286; 012-213-689-424-270; 014-744-329-084-394; 015-330-084-659-28X; 015-474-890-069-615; 015-829-797-239-552; 029-426-650-448-394; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-569-643-414-050; 030-582-421-227-58X; 031-709-011-755-787; 035-821-379-237-107; 046-488-108-889-851; 059-885-740-413-129; 066-831-095-116-219; 067-160-857-197-994; 068-986-037-255-244; 087-339-578-799-330; 097-246-508-596-431; 098-821-589-575-572; 109-381-535-599-334; 111-077-779-755-773; 113-272-606-061-219; 124-548-275-720-331; 134-548-354-615-84X; 157-272-602-894-658; 158-627-140-195-663; 167-299-724-279-859; 173-988-031-662-338; 184-169-063-089-804; 196-120-155-272-989,7,False,,,lens

Parigi,"During the last decades a consensus has emerged that it is impossible to disentangle liquidity shocks from solvency shocks. As a consequence the classical lender of last resort rules, as defined by Thornton and Bagehot, based on lending to solvent illiquid institutions appear ill-suited to this environment.

046-445-207-940-202,The role of local and peripheral antioxidants in the pathogenesis of chronic Periodontitis in smokers,2010-07-01,2010.0,dissertation,,,,,Nicola Ann Ling-Mountford,"Chronic periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases of man and accounts for 60% of tooth loss. It is initiated by the subgingival biofilm and in susceptible individuals an abnormal inflammatory-immune response fails to resolve the inflammation and leads to destruction of the supporting tissues and the teeth. Risk factors for periodontitis may be systemic or local and of the systemic risk factors the most significant is smoking. Periodontitis patients appear to express a hyper-inflammatory phenotype involving excess or prolonged production of enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from cells of the innate immune response (primarily neutrophils). Neutrophil hyper-reactivity and hyperactivity, with respect to ROS production, has been demonstrated by several authors. Consistent with the exaggerated ROS production is the depletion of antioxidant defences against ROS within the periodontal pockets. Cigarette smoke is also reported to increase the oxidative burden and deplete antioxidant defences, but no data are available on gingival crevicular (GCF) antioxidant levels in smokers compared to non-smokers. This thesis explores the total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) of GCF and plasma in smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis and analyses the impact of smoking on the outcomes of periodontal therapy and upon local and peripheral antioxidant status in both groups. The working hypothesis is that an important mechanism underpinning the increased prevalence of periodontitis in smokers involves reduction of antioxidant defences due to smoking and thus increased oxidative stress and tissue damage. The cross-sectional data presented here suggest that smokers with periodontitis have a further compromise in GCF TAOC compared to age-, gender- and disease-matched non-smokers with periodontitis. The longitudinal data presented within this thesis suggest that the compromised GCF TAOC concentration seen in periodontitis irrespective of smoking status is likely to result from the inflammatory lesion, rather than predisposing to it. Moreover, the impact of the periodontal inflammation upon TAOC compromise appears more dominant than the effects of smoking.",,,,,Innate immune system; Pathology; Immunology; Oxidative stress; Inflammation; Tooth loss; Chronic periodontitis; Periodontitis; Pathogenesis; Gingival and periodontal pocket; Medicine,,,,,http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/678/ http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/678/1/LingMountford10MPhil.pdf,http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/678/,,,203340235,,0,000-348-970-554-74X; 000-408-724-991-452; 000-608-816-662-310; 001-187-658-136-537; 001-482-428-584-467; 002-487-286-312-683; 002-968-893-898-265; 003-134-942-282-594; 003-428-321-998-155; 003-586-850-716-444; 003-912-807-068-358; 004-323-826-258-262; 006-053-377-252-548; 006-258-463-072-809; 006-503-614-348-005; 007-826-711-158-409; 007-886-890-434-548; 008-790-172-771-38X; 008-870-632-738-389; 008-887-366-299-504; 009-147-762-441-085; 009-423-893-161-401; 009-669-640-020-897; 010-466-079-124-548; 010-573-621-447-472; 011-507-186-654-24X; 012-347-113-593-569; 012-475-496-652-242; 013-565-131-903-139; 013-596-555-673-164; 014-980-511-537-390; 015-483-255-309-493; 015-493-982-794-623; 016-922-393-760-408; 017-043-064-461-314; 017-735-501-828-207; 018-277-311-265-731; 018-625-608-266-821; 019-235-438-160-76X; 019-382-866-354-608; 020-047-931-010-439; 020-320-109-760-168; 021-223-927-562-384; 021-406-799-439-534; 022-074-300-079-719; 022-920-756-490-901; 023-266-363-716-044; 023-273-191-615-831; 024-151-643-070-82X; 024-509-671-002-326; 025-877-166-589-045; 026-398-937-787-807; 026-907-351-189-503; 027-605-584-701-750; 027-616-166-457-381; 029-487-708-227-738; 030-405-928-794-375; 030-749-566-246-302; 031-045-369-741-364; 031-127-257-675-090; 031-771-545-482-629; 032-478-901-116-46X; 032-679-680-036-378; 032-827-890-871-680; 032-940-725-112-159; 033-413-677-202-476; 034-565-996-689-751; 036-313-422-865-64X; 036-839-807-195-831; 037-329-802-517-623; 037-662-683-725-890; 038-585-949-390-937; 040-971-189-285-84X; 042-775-417-394-701; 043-414-175-700-616; 043-592-063-349-288; 044-086-668-178-316; 044-793-488-023-651; 044-990-521-501-591; 045-249-772-811-628; 045-310-193-076-438; 045-482-359-049-490; 047-281-968-260-226; 049-051-133-306-539; 049-219-023-737-086; 049-879-930-192-415; 052-358-841-729-107; 054-758-769-961-600; 055-591-209-254-881; 058-517-916-549-578; 059-969-486-111-982; 060-218-392-086-630; 060-486-086-574-928; 061-322-407-563-791; 062-685-623-721-685; 062-940-100-693-457; 067-093-327-533-076; 068-203-781-913-512; 070-652-149-100-476; 070-831-090-671-541; 071-030-371-435-277; 072-842-628-739-306; 075-094-913-922-239; 075-209-398-357-630; 075-951-291-680-215; 076-334-613-900-886; 080-241-677-407-582; 080-544-269-819-295; 080-623-193-507-732; 080-756-766-486-975; 080-818-563-544-208; 080-880-336-329-10X; 081-178-084-621-548; 081-792-829-433-833; 081-811-187-565-64X; 082-670-544-504-416; 082-712-581-323-959; 083-290-238-784-685; 083-406-721-863-625; 083-943-566-934-561; 084-430-653-258-218; 084-484-481-200-266; 085-492-145-705-640; 085-497-425-924-197; 086-708-000-531-48X; 089-335-341-304-728; 089-470-196-523-482; 091-241-839-810-796; 098-030-029-629-500; 098-612-968-756-145; 100-335-155-662-034; 103-199-675-427-068; 104-836-366-787-823; 105-293-383-068-503; 105-888-982-013-46X; 106-053-947-244-626; 106-555-664-386-632; 106-824-950-635-540; 107-638-701-241-783; 108-019-274-153-95X; 109-284-512-185-214; 110-609-121-721-137; 115-395-835-726-256; 115-593-765-070-446; 118-843-293-506-579; 120-338-742-369-747; 125-657-798-549-229; 127-331-097-150-891; 128-139-442-093-098; 135-387-942-088-670; 137-762-484-896-287; 140-014-417-320-127; 144-319-179-553-154; 145-279-559-987-897; 146-228-555-873-434; 161-057-043-855-320; 178-792-447-573-504,0,False,,,lens

Black; Xin Huang; Hao Zhou,"<jats:p>We propose a hypothetical distress insurance premium (DIP) as a measure of the European banking systemic risk, which integrates the characteristics of bank size, default probability, and interconnectedness. Based on this measure, the systemic risk of European banks reached its height in late 2011 around € 500 billion. We find that the sovereign default spread is the factor driving this heightened risk in the banking sector during the European debt crisis. The methodology can also be used to identify the individual contributions of over 50 major European banks to the systemic risk measure. This approach captures the large contribution of a number of systemically important European banks, but Italian and Spanish banks as a group have notably increased their systemic importance. We also find that bank-specific fundamentals predict the one-year-ahead systemic risk contribution of our sample of banks in an economically meaningful way.</jats:p>",2013,1083,1,58,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/ifdp.2013.1083,,10.17016/ifdp.2013.1083,,,0,,5,True,,green,lens

Semenkovich,"The observations that atherosclerosis often occurs in non-smokers without elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and that most atherosclerosis loci so far identified in mice do not affect systemic risk factors associated with atherosclerosis, suggest that as-yet-unidentified mechanisms must contribute to vascular disease. Arterial walls undergo regional disturbances of metabolism that include the uncoupling of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, a process that occurs to some extent in all cells and may be characteristic of blood vessels being predisposed to the development of atherosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels promotes vascular disease, we generated mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in the artery wall. Here we show that UCP1 expression in aortic smooth muscle cells causes hypertension and increases dietary atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol levels. UCP1 expression also increases superoxide production and decreases the availability of nitric oxide, evidence of oxidative stress. These results provide proof of principle that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels can cause vascular disease.",435,7041,502,506,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Hemodynamics; Oxidative stress; Artery; Vascular disease; Cholesterol; Nitric oxide; Thermogenin; Blood pressure; Biology,,"Aconitate Hydratase/metabolism; Animals; Aorta/cytology; Apolipoproteins E/deficiency; Arteriosclerosis/genetics; Blood Pressure/physiology; Carrier Proteins/genetics; Cell Respiration/physiology; Cholesterol/blood; Diet; Doxycycline/pharmacology; Gene Expression/drug effects; Ion Channels; Membrane Proteins/genetics; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondrial Proteins; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology; Oxidative Stress; Phenotype; RNA, Messenger/genetics; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Renin/blood; Sodium/urine; Superoxides/metabolism; Transgenes/genetics; Uncoupling Agents/metabolism; Uncoupling Protein 1","Apolipoproteins E; Carrier Proteins; Ion Channels; Membrane Proteins; Mitochondrial Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Reactive Oxygen Species; Ucp1 protein, mouse; Uncoupling Agents; Uncoupling Protein 1; Superoxides; Cholesterol; Sodium; Renin; Aconitate Hydratase; Doxycycline",NIDDK NIH HHS (R01 DK088083) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/%2015917810 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15917810 https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03527.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15917810 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nat:nature:v:435:y:2005:i:7041:d:10.1038_nature03527 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005Natur.435..502B/abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15917810/ https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03527,15917810,10.1038/nature03527,2045307498,,0,000-594-142-215-690; 000-596-760-934-464; 002-022-728-472-298; 003-482-667-160-904; 004-578-054-110-536; 005-346-901-658-329; 012-493-609-022-634; 017-473-677-469-685; 026-663-655-051-097; 028-525-674-239-068; 036-438-416-041-862; 038-379-407-143-571; 044-979-183-684-104; 050-473-127-689-911; 059-196-971-855-895; 059-536-017-948-540; 060-992-943-511-182; 062-909-720-306-627; 064-905-335-046-00X; 075-462-255-220-994; 082-882-351-285-362; 089-105-120-680-558; 089-995-396-567-625; 109-466-782-288-00X; 114-787-797-851-30X; 125-683-698-843-729; 129-778-684-170-153; 130-475-031-239-00X; 158-275-078-133-544,163,False,,,lens

193-417-578-249-914,Critical Evaluation of Basel III as Prudential Regulation and its Consequences in Developing Countries’ Credit Needs,,2013.0,,,,,,Dawa Sherpa,"This paper seeks to critically evaluate the nature and motivation for the regulatory frame sought in the Basel III norms and its consequences on the credit needs of developing countries. After the failure of previous two Basel accords (I and II), to act as the effective prudential regulation of large financial institutions operating on global scale, the new Basel III accord is hailed as the new regulatory rule which has successfully taken into consideration of all the lacunas of earlier accord. But structurally all Basel accords are market mediated regulation, which tries to contain systemic crisis of financial institution by imposing better liquidity and capital requirements on financial institutions. It was unable to deal with strong elements of regulatory capture, which virtually makes it ineffective. All Basel accords at best tries to stop bank insolvency issues during crisis period but it does not prevent the crisis from occurring altogether (like Glass Steagall act, at 1933 in US). Not only it is micro prudential in nature, it also ignores endogenous evolution of risk of underlying assets of financial institutions. Also non-binding character and ‘one size fit for all’ approach of the recommendation makes it very hard to implement. And for developing nations new Basel III has the potential to make flow of credit more volatile and pro-cyclical and additionally it raises the cost of financing and reduces the level of credit available for developmental purposes. It is unable to deal with the issue of regulatory arbitrage and consequent rise of shadow banking activities in developing countries which are raising serious concern of systemic risk in financial system of these countries.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Regulatory capture; Market liquidity; Basel Accords; Financial institution; Basel III; Capital requirement; Insolvency; Financial system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/eyd/cp2013/253.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/eyd/cp2013/253.html,,,3123036007,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Bartlett,"Inefficiencies in the Information Thicket: A Case Study of Derivative Disclosures During the Financial Crisis Robert P. Bartlett, III * Abstract: Conventional wisdom concerning the causes of the Financial Crisis posits that insufficient disclosure concerning firms’ exposure to complex credit derivatives played a key role in creating the uncertainty that plagued the financial sector in the fall of 2008. To help avert future financial crises, regulatory proposals aimed at containing systemic risk have accordingly focused on enhanced derivative disclosures as a critical reform measure. A central challenge facing these proposals, however, has been understanding whether enhanced derivative disclosures can have any meaningful effect given the complexity of credit derivative transactions. This Article provides an empirical examination of the effect of enhanced derivative disclosures by examining the disclosure experience of the monoline insurance industry in 2008. Like AIG Financial Products, monoline insurance companies wrote billions of dollars of credit default swaps on multi-sector CDOs tied to residential home mortgages, but unlike AIG, their unique status as financial guarantee companies subjected them to considerable disclosure obligations concerning their individual credit derivative exposures. As a result, the experience of the monoline industry during the Financial Crisis provides an ideal setting with which to test the efficacy of reforms aimed at promoting more elaborate derivative disclosures. Overall, the results of this study indicate that investors in monoline insurers showed little evidence of using a firm’s derivative disclosures to efficiently resolve uncertainty about a monoline’s exposure to credit risk. In particular, analysis of the abnormal returns to Ambac Financial (one of the largest monoline insurers) surrounding a series of significant, multi-notch rating downgrades of its insured CDOs reveals no significant stock price reactions until Ambac itself announced the effect of these downgrades in its quarterly earnings announcements. Similar analyses of Ambac’s short-selling data and changes in the cost of insuring Ambac debt securities against default also confirm the absence of a market reaction following these downgrade announcements. Following a qualitative examination of how investors process derivative disclosures, the Article concludes that to the extent the complexity of CDOs impeded informational efficiency, it was most likely due to the generally low salience of individual CDOs as well as the logistic (although not necessarily analytic) challenge of processing a CDO’s disclosures. Reform efforts aimed at enhancing derivative disclosures should accordingly focus on mechanisms to promote the rapid collection and compilation of disclosed information as well as the psychological processes by which information obtains salience.

Badimon,"Recent advances in basic science have linked some systemic risk factors to endothelial dysfunction which gives rise to atherosclerotic disease and triggers the progression of thrombotic complications. Superficial erosion of the stenotic plaque can be observed in onethird of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In these cases the presence of classic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and smoking favor a state of «vulnerable blood» or high risk. Increased thrombogenicity can exacerbate thrombus formation and is able to trigger an ACS. The vessel endothelium regulates contractile, mitogenic and thrombotic activities of the vessel wall. Risk factors impair both homeostasis and hemostasis of the vessel wall and promote inflammatory signals. Platelet and monocyte activation favors the expression of tissue factor (TF), thus triggering the coagulation cascade with thrombin generation and clot formation. Increased blood thrombogenicity linked to classic risk factors may be associated with circulating TF levels which are much higher than those observed in healthy subjects without risk factors.

A large bankruptcy in bilateral markets may leave a counterparty unable to expectationally prevent bankruptcy (checkmate) or make counterparties push markets and profit from contagion (hunting). In distress, bilateral markets amplify systemic risk and volatility versus centralized markets and are more subject to crises with real effects: contagion, unemployment, reduced tax revenue, higher transactions costs, lower risk sharing, and reduced allocative efficiency. Pricing distress volatility may suggest when to transition to central clearing.

It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed ‘Systemic Risk Tax’ (SRT) leads to a self-organiz...",16,10,1599,1613,Financial economics; Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Financial networks; Empirical data; Maturity (finance); Monetary economics; Database transaction; Cascading failure; Business; Credit risk; Restructuring,,,,European Commission,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:taf:quantf:v:16:y:2016:i:10:p:1599-1613 https://tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/14697688.2016.1156146 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.8026 https://core.ac.uk/display/33972009 https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/quantf/v16y2016i10p1599-1613.html https://tandfonline.com/doi/ref/10.1080/14697688.2016.1156146 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14697688.2016.1156146 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/12653/ https://core.ac.uk/download/33972009.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2016.1156146,,10.1080/14697688.2016.1156146,1571938765; 3102167329,,0,001-274-723-652-948; 001-619-997-217-899; 001-958-980-989-960; 002-691-531-937-176; 002-990-305-553-780; 005-540-929-147-925; 007-326-933-022-354; 008-197-257-997-110; 008-330-029-601-17X; 010-008-864-593-130; 013-118-111-585-482; 017-421-298-700-053; 017-550-858-667-206; 019-363-624-924-440; 019-687-296-589-620; 020-197-675-681-981; 020-699-158-967-631; 022-404-239-527-189; 025-094-460-907-584; 025-303-272-106-219; 030-582-421-227-58X; 031-859-026-871-151; 032-023-767-273-227; 034-618-882-762-654; 034-967-004-796-717; 035-104-934-704-682; 035-589-237-005-323; 036-931-922-556-569; 038-128-609-517-635; 039-951-801-736-923; 040-801-336-012-314; 041-229-457-601-598; 048-507-442-645-848; 050-160-641-011-399; 052-619-799-818-546; 055-841-935-818-572; 057-320-712-894-93X; 057-926-597-770-259; 059-561-895-518-856; 062-547-592-425-211; 066-726-956-150-060; 077-436-811-650-375; 077-525-074-871-112; 081-327-699-063-120; 082-092-908-586-44X; 083-508-652-775-775; 088-149-451-347-256; 090-328-172-692-220; 098-197-143-870-116; 099-351-099-695-048; 101-937-167-520-388; 104-058-318-340-973; 107-320-922-263-505; 108-528-259-935-705; 110-637-199-001-314; 111-921-399-686-447; 118-933-861-309-071; 123-699-515-895-205; 124-132-600-843-548; 125-011-400-279-052; 127-548-643-861-269; 136-106-944-186-234; 142-631-391-157-152; 149-503-486-528-348; 151-907-400-916-650; 153-428-982-491-529; 157-086-115-812-927; 175-137-176-950-768; 176-765-826-448-758; 183-376-861-980-736; 196-341-480-069-844,79,True,,green,lens

Objective:  This study aims to determine the prevalence, pattern and risk factors for retinal vascular occlusions in a tertiary hospital in Jos,Nigeria. Methodology:  A retrospective review of all cases of retinal vascular occlusions seen in the eye clinic from January 2011 to December 2014 was carried out.The patients were identified from the clinic register and their case folders retrieved.The following data were then extracted from the files; patients' age, sex, presenting visual acuity, presence of any systemic disorders and type of retinal vascular occlusion.Data analysis was done using Epi Info 7. Results:  Three thousand eight hundred and twenty one new patients were seen during the study period and there were 52 (1.36%) cases of retinal vascular occlusions.Only the case files of 44(84.6%) patients were available and were analysed. These were made up of 17 (39%) males and 27 (61%) females.These had a total of 46 retinal vascular occlusions made up of 37 (80.4%)retinal vein occlusions,8 (17.4%) central retinal artery occlusions and a case (2.2%) of combined central retinal artery and vein occlusion. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common systemic risk factors while glaucoma was the most common ocular association. Conclusion:  Retinal vascular occlusions are uncommon in our centre butlead to severe visual loss and are associated with significant systemic pathologies.

Buch; Tobias Körner; Benjamin Weigert,"The European Banking Union is a major step forward in fixing major deficiencies in the institutional framework of the Euro area. The absence of effective banking supervision and resolution powers at the European level promoted excessive private risk-taking in the up-run to the Euro crisis. Effective private risk sharing once risks materialized has been hampered. A properly designed Banking Union facilitates and improves private risk sharing, and it is thus a necessary institutional complement to a monetary union. Yet, the institutional framework of the Banking Union needs further strengthening in three regards. First, the supervisory framework needs to ensure uniform supervisory standards for all banks, including those located in non-Euro area countries. Also, conflicts of interest between monetary policy and banking supervision need to be mitigated. Second, bank resolution suffers from a highly complex governance structure. Restructuring and bail-in rules allow for a high degree of discretion at the level of the resolution authority. We propose to introduce a statutory systemic risk exception, by which the exercise of discretion would be reduced, thereby strengthening the credibility of the bail-in. Third, in order to enhance the credibility of creditor involvement, fiscal backstops and ex-ante specified cross-border burden-sharing agreements are needed.",,,,,Economic policy; Monetary policy; Business; Systemic risk; Creditor; Banking union; Discretion; Single Resolution Mechanism; Restructuring; Financial regulation; Financial system,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwsvrwwp/022013r.htm https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/iwhdps/iwh-13-13.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwsvrwwp/022013r.htm,,,2007377690,,0,,4,False,,,lens

017-510-691-598-74X,The prevalence and systemic risk factors of diabetic macular edema: a cross-sectional study from Turkey,2018-04-12,2018.0,journal article,BMC ophthalmology,14712415,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,United Kingdom,Durgul Acan; Mehmet Calan; Duygu Er; Tugba Arkan; Nilüfer Koçak; Firat Bayraktar; Süleyman Kaynak,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of diabetic macular edema (DME) utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to clarify the effects of the systemic findings and risk factors on the development of DME. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the departments of ophthalmology and endocrinology at the Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine in Izmir, Turkey. The demographics, type and duration of diabetes mellitus, treatment modality, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, as well as the systemic blood pressure, renal functional tests, hemoglobulin A1c level, serum lipid profile, and 24-h urine albumin level were noted and statistically analyzed. The relationships between the systemic findings and DME were studied. Four-hundred and thirteen eyes of 413 diabetic patients who were examined between January 2011 and July 2012 were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of DME was 15.3% among the patients. The males exhibited DME significantly more frequently than the females (p = 0.031), and the duration of diabetes was significantly longer in those patients with DME (p < 0.001). Those patients without DME frequently used antihyperlipidemic drugs and had a higher level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.040 and p = 0.046, respectively). The patient’s alcohol consumption, nephropathy, neuropathy, previous cataract surgery, severity of diabetic retinopathy, and insulin usage were statistically significant factors with regard to the DME prevalence. This study demonstrated the prevalence of DME in Turkey by utilizing OCT. The development of DME can be avoided or limited and the response to treatment may be improved by the regulation of the DME risk factors.",18,1,1,8,Internal medicine; Cross-sectional study; Cataract surgery; Lipid profile; Insulin; Diabetic retinopathy; High-density lipoprotein; Nephropathy; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,Diabetic macular edema; Optical coherence tomography; Prevalence,Age Factors; Aged; Biomarkers/blood; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetic Retinopathy/epidemiology; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin/analysis; Humans; Macular Edema/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Turkey/epidemiology,"Biomarkers; Glycated Hemoglobin A; hemoglobin A1c protein, human",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29649995/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12886-018-0753-y.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12886-018-0753-y https://bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12886-018-0753-y https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5897948 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897948 https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12886-018-0753-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12886-018-0753-y,29649995,10.1186/s12886-018-0753-y,2807184803,PMC5897948,0,001-075-340-076-400; 002-108-066-307-636; 002-347-543-993-738; 002-977-150-090-69X; 005-346-142-234-073; 005-371-199-158-109; 005-377-093-285-879; 008-498-829-197-506; 008-615-241-933-779; 009-698-037-950-881; 010-329-052-308-071; 011-040-096-198-854; 011-900-678-457-454; 014-283-481-660-254; 014-767-594-526-896; 016-098-338-821-906; 017-087-102-426-814; 017-129-511-958-750; 020-832-201-117-174; 021-562-172-210-191; 024-690-063-547-807; 033-142-368-610-992; 034-544-535-036-288; 035-489-988-991-357; 036-013-613-814-621; 038-151-751-011-980; 041-875-795-596-513; 042-160-285-333-390; 044-519-668-340-29X; 046-113-666-570-65X; 048-627-510-085-915; 051-196-174-712-575; 051-321-258-891-697; 051-732-091-713-165; 052-052-142-455-571; 054-624-271-997-872; 054-658-993-636-214; 055-872-757-936-585; 056-863-163-652-843; 057-881-614-865-836; 058-157-986-374-316; 068-230-076-388-250; 072-322-062-851-446; 072-341-472-279-298; 072-846-505-819-603; 073-081-951-455-656; 077-256-707-263-385; 078-366-368-546-383; 078-704-015-086-069; 080-354-490-591-94X; 081-779-906-985-855; 082-878-940-121-575; 086-800-106-362-399; 091-883-810-392-206; 092-143-070-483-526; 094-713-552-334-990; 099-267-909-948-712; 101-458-218-763-69X; 101-895-153-830-593; 105-768-620-456-427; 107-942-553-057-568; 111-243-162-703-835; 115-894-089-519-437; 127-110-843-154-706; 130-725-700-213-384; 143-701-532-506-967; 149-206-369-112-633; 159-654-367-982-151; 165-032-940-327-645; 165-658-331-960-677; 189-359-015-390-028,31,True,"CC BY, CC0",gold,lens

007-818-004-293-011,Systemic Risk and Regulation of the U.S. Insurance Industry,,2014.0,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,J. David Cummins; Mary A. Weiss,"This paper analyzes the characteristics of U.S. insurers for purposes of determining whether they are systemically risky. More specifically, primary factors (size, interconnectedness, and lack of substitutability) and contributing factors (leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, complexity and government regulation) associated with systemic risk are assessed for the insurance sector. A distinction is made between the core activities of insurers (e.g., underwriting, reserving, claims settlement, etc.) and non-core activities (such as providing financial guarantees). Statistical analysis of insurer characteristics and their relationship with a well-known systemic risk measure, systemic expected shortfall, is provided. Consistent with other research, the core activities of property-casualty insurers are found not to be systemically risky. However, we do find evidence that some core activities of life insurers, particularly separate accounts and group annuities, may be associated with systemic risk. The non-core activities of both property-casualty and life insurers can contribute to systemic risk. However, research findings indicate that generally insurers are victims rather than propagators of systemic risk events. The study also finds that insurers may be susceptible to intra-sector crises such as reinsurance crises arising from counterparty credit risk. New and proposed state and federal regulation are reviewed in light of the potential for systemic risk for this sector.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Reinsurance; Credit risk; Liquidity risk; Underwriting; Financial risk management; Expected shortfall; Auto insurance risk selection,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2400577_code2099.pdf?abstractid=2400577&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2400577 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2400577 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2235140,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2400577,,10.2139/ssrn.2400577,2169516342,,0,002-235-600-386-584; 008-832-184-934-994; 013-735-464-347-344; 017-486-496-247-162; 019-237-615-161-050; 028-388-183-377-919; 033-706-168-858-273; 035-104-934-704-682; 040-204-360-693-062; 042-655-561-106-640; 044-364-148-453-019; 045-456-515-141-805; 046-169-328-895-892; 060-652-416-262-582; 064-918-277-007-696; 081-597-021-118-327; 081-740-060-661-874; 084-010-254-300-836; 086-771-766-095-679; 090-436-724-624-372; 091-929-532-670-253; 111-020-368-618-902; 122-779-428-131-390; 139-751-143-546-819; 149-997-843-155-934; 150-112-959-289-349; 154-897-077-636-351; 156-759-395-518-18X; 181-535-816-399-945; 181-976-014-036-695; 197-129-658-402-674,2,True,,green,lens

The considered model extends one originally proposed to study systemic risk in networks of financial institutions interconnected by mutual obligations and is one of the simplest continuous models accounting for shock propagation phenomena and cascading failure effects. It also characterizes Nash equilibria of constrained quadratic network games with strategic complementarities. We first derive explicit expressions for network equilibria and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for their uniqueness encompassing and generalizing results available in the literature. Then, we study jump discontinuities of the network equilibria when the exogenous flows cross certain regions of measure 0 representable as graphs of continuous functions. Finally, we discuss some implications of our results in the two main motivating applications. In financial networks, this bifurcation phenomenon is responsible for how small shocks in the assets of a few nodes can trigger major aggregate losses to the system and cause the default of several agents.

The results suggest that the usage of credit cards will be affected by the behavior of other farmers; namely, the usage of credit cards has peer effects in rural areas. We also verify that women, older, and low-academic farmers show stronger peer effects. The results emphasize that, compared with the mass farmers and vulnerable farmers, the usage of elite farmers is more likely to affect the same behaviors of other farmers. Our study contributes to prior literature by giving empirical insights into the consequences of peer effects on the credit card usage of farmers, which conduces to a better understanding of the financial decision-making of farmers. The research may provide a practical implication for the optimal design of policy interventions. On the one hand, banks and other financial institutions can promote innovative financial products in rural areas with the help of peer effects; on the other hand, regulators can regulate farmers’ wrong financial behaviors by the social multiplier of peer effects to reduce systemic risks in rural finance.</jats:p>",2022,,1,11,China; Business; Peer effects; Rural area; Credit card; Psychological intervention; Peer-to-peer; Affect (linguistics); Finance; Payment; Psychology; Medicine; Social psychology; Distributed computing; Communication; Pathology; Psychiatry; Political science; Computer science; Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/4831006,,10.1155/2022/4831006,,,0,000-064-759-294-394; 011-348-148-875-409; 012-987-341-385-812; 014-974-280-841-932; 017-881-897-445-004; 022-868-412-221-657; 026-935-226-692-394; 027-315-261-880-023; 029-360-343-552-280; 035-267-262-835-167; 044-239-699-834-544; 049-951-975-921-929; 055-609-360-869-806; 057-392-696-887-125; 077-227-377-239-629; 078-922-244-825-684; 086-027-167-819-414; 089-622-548-887-766; 093-758-077-181-069; 113-521-202-940-721; 114-148-850-295-410; 118-430-844-305-306; 122-980-870-606-744; 126-879-434-868-552; 142-855-298-342-989; 172-979-839-503-857; 178-308-210-916-778; 196-254-690-314-945,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Rother; Isabel Schnabel,"This paper empirically analyzes the effects of asset price bubbles on systemic risk. Based on a broad sample of banks from 17 OECD countries between 1987 and 2015, we show that asset price bubbles in stock and real estate markets raise systemic risk at the bank level. The strength of the effect depends strongly on bank characteristics (bank size, loan growth, leverage, and maturity mismatch) as well as bubble characteristics (length and size). These findings suggest that the adverse effects of bubbles can be mitigated substantially by strengthening the resilience of financial institutions.",,,,,Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Economics; Asset (economics); Loan; Maturity (finance); Monetary economics; Stock (geology); Leverage (finance); Real estate,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/12362.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:25775,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/12362.html,,,3021469899,,0,,1,False,,,lens

For this reason, systemic risk assessment with partial information is potentially very useful for regulators and other stakeholders. In this paper we consider systemic risk due to fire sales spillovers and portfolio rebalancing by using the risk metrics defined by Greenwood et al. (2015). By using a method based on the constrained minimization of the Cross Entropy, we show that it is possible to assess aggregated and single bank’s systemicness and vulnerability, using only the information on the size of each bank and the capitalization of each investment asset. We also compare our approach with an alternative widespread application of the Maximum Entropy principle allowing to derive graph probability distributions and generating scenarios and we use it to propose a statistical test for a change in banks’ vulnerability to systemic events.",94,,117,141,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Cross entropy; Market liquidity; Financial networks; Portfolio; Asset (computer security); Vulnerability (computing); Principle of maximum entropy,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165188918301787 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/dyncon/v94y2018icp117-141.html https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/666207 https://cris.unibo.it/bitstream/11585/666207/2/jedc_Lillo_2018.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150900607D/abstract https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:dyncon:v:94:y:2018:i:c:p:117-141 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188918301787 https://art.torvergata.it/handle/2108/214761,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jedc.2018.07.001,,10.1016/j.jedc.2018.07.001,3123127806,,0,003-999-360-869-232; 004-403-672-368-679; 004-871-543-401-169; 006-654-454-132-907; 008-620-705-366-714; 009-096-390-741-572; 009-524-565-511-68X; 010-008-864-593-130; 010-423-042-177-734; 010-787-191-725-48X; 011-876-099-486-843; 012-006-078-437-839; 012-485-944-034-923; 013-735-464-347-344; 014-039-793-796-113; 015-330-084-659-28X; 019-124-643-557-203; 019-835-386-568-489; 023-449-471-195-292; 024-828-296-919-906; 025-023-867-651-148; 025-162-880-687-938; 025-412-456-114-697; 025-915-350-487-916; 029-498-496-548-508; 035-477-508-309-18X; 038-775-660-896-758; 040-862-843-920-789; 041-724-272-488-582; 043-655-236-141-959; 044-509-306-852-854; 045-313-948-577-622; 048-363-026-036-293; 051-903-528-031-591; 054-293-409-557-957; 056-344-018-526-723; 056-344-237-437-43X; 057-644-628-522-157; 057-913-304-551-050; 058-447-868-649-353; 061-195-863-850-701; 066-951-892-382-137; 067-160-857-197-994; 067-506-453-015-037; 068-750-519-850-694; 070-068-719-560-798; 073-581-671-636-592; 077-651-523-989-843; 082-830-110-176-304; 083-377-449-558-559; 084-065-372-432-31X; 084-672-967-888-046; 089-906-263-658-85X; 091-359-516-133-907; 094-358-206-649-929; 097-844-087-447-103; 098-821-291-603-008; 100-071-562-666-167; 100-509-925-640-286; 101-800-339-486-466; 104-277-691-103-925; 104-895-406-435-997; 114-787-614-188-374; 115-912-228-451-249; 122-779-428-131-390; 137-580-849-056-129; 141-812-879-602-471; 143-963-294-973-93X; 157-393-304-403-188; 164-639-749-606-499,29,True,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid,lens

103-246-920-086-906,What Happened to the Quants in August 2007?: Evidence from Factors and Transactions Data,,2008.0,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Amir E. Khandani; Andrew W. Lo,"During the week of August 6, 2007, a number of quantitative long/short equity hedge funds experienced unprecedented losses. It has been hypothesized that a coordinated deleveraging of similarly constructed portfolios caused this temporary dislocation in the market. Using the simulated returns of long/short equity portfolios based on five specific valuation factors, we find evidence that the unwinding of these portfolios began in July 2007 and continued until the end of 2007. Using transactions data, we find that the simulated returns of a simple marketmaking strategy were significantly negative during the week of August 6, 2007, but positive before and after, suggesting that the Quant Meltdown of August 2007 was the combined effects of portfolio deleveraging throughout July and the first week of August, and a temporary withdrawal of marketmaking risk capital starting August 8th. Our simulations point to two unwinds - a mini-unwind on August 1st starting at 10:45am and ending at 11:30am, and a more sustained unwind starting at the open on August 6th and ending at 1:00pm - that began with stocks in the financial sector and long Book-to-Market and short Earnings Momentum. These conjectures have significant implications for the systemic risks posed by the hedge-fund industry.",,,,,Financial economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Statistical arbitrage; Long/short equity; Hedge fund; Equity (finance); Deleveraging; Portfolio; Earnings; Monetary economics,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/103906548 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1288988 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1288988_code17399.pdf?abstractid=1288988 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1297695,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1288988,,10.2139/ssrn.1288988,2047394894,,0,006-667-076-920-617; 007-324-637-984-277; 008-084-214-919-920; 010-029-284-399-449; 011-164-102-167-734; 011-898-372-474-85X; 020-590-319-930-436; 021-813-650-201-251; 024-875-779-231-702; 025-642-224-793-284; 025-828-422-182-228; 026-449-509-255-772; 031-808-539-722-506; 033-580-124-541-257; 034-330-953-548-063; 034-592-028-542-57X; 035-104-934-704-682; 042-725-583-131-709; 043-967-321-042-851; 046-108-901-891-503; 048-986-613-587-859; 051-825-589-256-160; 054-118-654-225-261; 054-574-447-562-897; 062-412-251-485-832; 067-430-579-791-957; 071-266-356-771-425; 076-452-869-117-366; 080-282-173-548-227; 080-428-784-900-161; 082-962-455-134-243; 083-334-502-058-300; 085-737-925-036-321; 086-771-766-095-679; 089-308-393-175-805; 092-305-194-560-481; 092-963-427-496-607; 094-340-582-406-482; 100-446-896-445-856; 104-021-308-899-336; 106-919-067-177-132; 108-407-075-919-814; 108-524-401-617-647; 108-970-368-148-657; 110-032-626-681-333; 111-177-159-620-876; 118-178-758-557-53X; 120-509-336-114-996; 120-641-134-597-879; 121-103-038-184-351; 124-248-638-162-072; 125-394-372-861-715; 137-303-720-791-151; 137-501-446-909-213; 137-518-278-849-75X; 138-291-898-274-099; 139-315-799-043-201; 140-386-626-462-241; 141-254-744-086-648; 148-303-420-200-718; 150-754-186-857-766; 151-026-253-897-292; 156-100-775-572-190; 166-873-938-666-00X; 167-695-464-144-310; 175-948-570-498-836; 178-732-751-879-802; 183-524-311-454-207; 191-046-528-728-690; 193-176-026-086-390; 196-524-401-795-883,106,True,cc-by-nc-nd,green,lens
093-701-346-485-54X,Experimental Computational Simulation Environments for Algorithmic Trading,2014-01-28,2014.0,dissertation,,,,,M Galas,"This thesis investigates experimental Computational Simulation Environments for Computational Finance that for the purpose of this study focused on Algorithmic Trading (AT) models and their risk. Within Computational Finance, AT combines different analytical techniques from statistics, machine learning and economics to create algorithms capable of taking, executing and administering investment decisions with optimal levels of profit and risk. Computational Simulation Environments are crucial for Big Data Analytics, and are increasingly being used by major financial institutions for researching algorithm models, evaluation of their stability, estimation of their optimal parameters and their expected risk and performance profiles. These large-scale Environments are predominantly designed for testing, optimisation and monitoring of algorithms running in virtual or real trading mode. The stateof-the-art Computational Simulation Environment described in this thesis is believed to be the first available for academic research in Computational Finance; specifically Financial Economics and AT. Consequently, the aim of the thesis was: 1) to set the operational expectations of the environment, and 2) to holistically evaluate the prototype software architecture of the system by providing access to it to the academic community via a series of trading competitions. Three key studies have been conducted as part of this thesis: a) an experiment investigating the design of Electronic Market Simulation Models; b) an experiment investigating the design of a Computational Simulation Environment for researching Algorithmic Trading; c) an experiment investigating algorithms and the design of a Portfolio Selection System, a key component of AT systems. Electronic Market Simulation Models (Experiment 1): this study investigates methods of simulating Electronic Markets (EMs) to enable computational finance experiments in trading. EMs are central hubs for bilateral exchange of securities in a well-defined, contracted and controlled manner. Such modern markets rely on electronic networks and are designed to replace Open Outcry Exchanges for the advantage of increased speed, reduced costs of transaction, and programmatic access. Study of simulation models of EMs is important from the point of view of testing trading paradigms, as it allows users to tailor the simulation to the needs of particular trading paradigms. This is a common practice amongst investment institutions to use EMs to fine-tune their algorithms before allowing the algorithms to trade with real funds. Simulations of EMs provide users with the ability to investigate the market micro-structure and to participate in a market, receive live data feeds and monitor their behaviour without bearing any of the risks associated with real-time market trading. Simulated EMs are used by risk managers to test risk characteristics and by quant developers to build and test quantitative financial systems against market behaviour. Computational Simulation Environments (Experiment 2): this study investigates the design, implementation and testing of an experimental Environment for Algorithmic Trading able to support a variety of AT strategies. The Environment consists of a set of distributed, multi-threaded, event-driven, real-time, Linux services communicating with each other via an asynchronous messaging system. The Environment allows multi-user real and virtual trading. It provides a proprietary application programming interface (API) to support research into algorithmic trading models and strategies. It supports advanced trading-signal generation and analysis in near real-time, with use of statistical and technical analysis as well as data mining methods. It provides data aggregation functionalities to process and store market data feeds. Portfolio Selection System (Experiment 3): this study investigates a key component of Computational Finance systems to discover exploitable relationships between financial time-series applicable amongst others to algorithmic trading; where the challenge lays in identification of similarities/dissimilarities in behaviour of elements within variable-size portfolios of tradable and non-tradable securities. Recognition of sets of securities characterized by a very similar/dissimilar behaviour over time, is beneficial from the perspective of risk management, recognition of statistical arbitrage and hedge opportunities, and can be also beneficial from the point of view of portfolio diversification. Consequently, a large-scale search algorithm enabling discovery of sets of securities with AT domain-specific similarity characteristics can be utilized in creation of better portfolio-based strategies, pairs-trading strategies, statistical arbitrage strategies, hedging and mean-reversion strategies. This thesis has the following contributions to science: Electronic Markets Simulation - identifies key features, modes of operation and software architecture of an electronic financial exchange for simulated (virtual) trading. It also identifies key exchange simulation models. These simulation models are crucial in the process of evaluation of trading algorithms and systemic risk. Majority of the proposed models are believed to be unique in the academia. Computational Simulation Environment - design, implementation and testing of a prototype experimental Computational Simulation Environment for Computational Finance research, currently supporting the design of trading algorithms and their associated risk. This is believed to be unique in the academia. Portfolio Selection System - defines what is believed to be a unique software system for portfolio selection containing a combinatorial framework for discovery of subsets of internally cointegrated time-series of financial securities and a graph-guided search algorithm for combinatorial selection of such time-series subsets.",,,,,Market data; Technical analysis; Engineering; Trading strategy; Industrial engineering; Systemic risk; Computational finance; Portfolio; Open outcry; Management science; Algorithmic trading,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.626762 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1418208/,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.626762,,,80722769,,0,002-138-384-474-162; 004-981-461-324-320; 005-126-644-445-001; 006-440-782-669-670; 007-721-620-041-562; 008-610-957-723-23X; 019-667-089-811-657; 023-024-686-077-353; 027-715-236-881-959; 031-790-942-688-149; 035-401-224-135-906; 038-628-098-620-446; 039-953-922-152-421; 042-883-888-577-297; 043-041-921-419-377; 044-447-761-889-885; 044-806-191-748-66X; 045-545-064-515-269; 045-641-389-232-427; 047-255-612-585-354; 048-872-706-534-697; 053-707-465-287-745; 053-721-799-224-69X; 055-858-941-146-304; 059-152-189-407-465; 060-324-799-089-314; 060-713-245-915-839; 061-764-406-403-487; 062-412-251-485-832; 068-793-128-177-025; 072-564-212-864-827; 084-115-900-488-003; 105-355-963-060-525; 111-308-438-377-386; 132-851-831-620-73X; 136-788-362-908-701; 138-368-560-699-64X; 139-730-705-005-908; 162-895-785-891-979; 182-178-668-876-589; 184-735-460-194-812; 199-600-362-488-290,1,False,,,lens

In the context of insurance, social networks, and telecommunication, risk factors often tend to be heavy-tailed and thus frequently studied under the paradigm of regular variation. We show that regular variation on different subspaces of the Euclidean space leads to these risk measures exhibiting distinct asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, we elicit connections between regular variation on these subspaces and the behavior of tail copula parameters extending previous work and providing a broad framework for studying such risk measures under multivariate regular variation.

Veith; Evan C. Lipsitz; Takao Ohki; William D. Suggs; Manish Mehta; Katherine Freeman; Jamie McKay; George L. Berdejo; Reese A. Wain; Nicholas J. Gargiulo,"Abstract Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and the role of a modified retroperitoneal approach in a high-volume endovascular center. Methods We reviewed prospectively collected data for 175 elective infrarenal open AAA repairs performed over 6 years. A transperitoneal approach was used in 118 procedures, and a modified retroperitoneal approach was used in 57 procedures. The incisional modification, which facilitated repair in patients with massive obesity, scarring, or ventral hernia, included a higher, more posterolateral location in the ninth intercostal space. Risk factors that added to the difficulty of the repair included aneurysms with a short ( P = .04-.001) in the retroperitoneal group. All factors were correlated with outcome. Results Despite these risk factors, overall 30-day mortality was 3.5% (retroperitoneal group, 3.8%), and mean length of hospital stay was 9 days (retroperitoneal group, 8 days). There was no significant correlation between mortality or length of stay and any of the mentioned risk factors ( P > .2). Conclusion In the era of endovascular aneurysm exclusion, open AAA repair is generally used to treat anatomically complex or difficult aneurysms, many of which are present in patients at high risk. Despite this combination of anatomic and systemic risk factors, the modified retroperitoneal approach facilitates treatment in difficult circumstances and enables open AAA repair to be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity.",38,3,504,510,Radiology; Surgery; Aneurysm; Vascular disease; Abdominal aortic aneurysm; Abdominal aorta; Ninth intercostal space; Retroperitoneal approach; Ventral hernia; In patient; Medicine,,"Academic Medical Centers; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anastomosis, Surgical; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/diagnostic imaging; Aortography; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Laparotomy/methods; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications/mortality; Probability; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retroperitoneal Space; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Surgical Procedures/methods",,,https://einstein.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/open-aneurysm-repair-at-an-endovascular-center-value-of-a-modifie-2 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/12947268 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12947268 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0741521403004415 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521403004415 https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(03)00441-5/fulltext https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(03)00441-5/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82330958.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0741-5214(03)00441-5,12947268,10.1016/s0741-5214(03)00441-5,2141889745,,0,004-686-012-931-73X; 005-104-571-842-294; 009-172-689-678-055; 009-969-701-788-07X; 012-785-133-263-225; 013-372-087-738-058; 013-810-325-005-173; 014-673-816-500-601; 018-506-556-650-474; 021-045-571-507-296; 024-921-466-142-690; 036-356-874-891-478; 037-023-437-674-353; 040-251-203-787-702; 040-692-507-658-313; 044-478-920-785-197; 060-447-858-310-18X; 061-118-018-811-386; 066-855-398-334-199; 067-189-392-542-389; 088-300-091-015-897; 098-182-427-231-023; 133-189-274-254-927; 137-150-697-453-765; 143-937-975-626-299; 150-605-242-151-831,31,True,elsevier-specific: oa user license,,lens

Graff,"Purpose; ; ; ; ; The past century and a quarter can be divided into three successive eras for homeownership policy characterization. For the first four decades, the federal government pursued a laissez-faire policy that left housing issues to the individual states and private markets. For the next six decades, the federal government implemented a policy created as part of the Roosevelt New Deal program. Finally, the Clinton administration discarded the New Deal policy in favor of a more aggressive policy that has continued to the present day. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of the respective policies.; ; ; ; ; Design/methodology/approach; ; ; ; ; The study introduces two metrics.

Moreover, two nonparametric methods are utilized, the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and the bootstrap Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, in order to investigate the changes in individual effects and the dominant ranks of sectoral systemic risk. The empirical results show that (1) the mean values and volatilities of CES and MES of all sectors have a higher level of magnitude in the extreme risk status than those in the normal risk status; (2) by comparing the total effects of three crisis events, we find that different from the continuous shock effect caused by two other events, sectoral systemic risk has a hysteresis effect on the entire market after the outbreak of COVID-19; (3) the long-term and short-term individual effects of sectoral systemic risk in all sectors are different from each other during three events; and (4) the dominance tests of MES are more sensitive and thus better demonstrate the changes in the rankings of sectoral systemic risk than the dominant tests of CES during the emergency crisis events.</jats:p>",11,3,147,147,Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Econometrics; Shock (circulatory); Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Economics; Panel data; Medicine; Macroeconomics; Economic growth; Internal medicine; Curriculum,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11030147,,10.3390/systems11030147,,,0,000-846-266-307-085; 003-467-629-451-027; 004-373-174-541-614; 004-681-262-554-153; 004-812-000-520-233; 005-482-505-214-888; 006-482-961-483-64X; 010-096-018-132-741; 011-165-152-588-670; 014-891-766-180-931; 016-434-257-654-499; 018-729-533-856-590; 019-895-525-991-813; 022-602-756-773-14X; 025-023-867-651-148; 025-413-253-786-324; 025-786-505-152-291; 026-603-389-236-456; 030-190-346-653-358; 034-468-812-514-734; 036-079-671-961-066; 036-264-418-039-005; 036-557-636-952-889; 038-121-317-352-953; 041-244-565-711-589; 043-198-095-708-796; 048-059-932-653-334; 049-360-289-484-47X; 049-816-811-346-508; 052-264-044-360-530; 056-413-725-488-38X; 056-650-047-783-273; 058-312-585-132-903; 062-014-008-000-010; 062-737-954-580-970; 063-065-555-331-288; 064-997-679-681-921; 073-988-011-277-963; 074-546-376-704-479; 075-847-573-811-981; 078-964-547-449-925; 082-612-869-000-341; 082-991-883-805-288; 084-294-972-106-090; 088-941-096-021-938; 090-259-128-030-741; 091-795-834-140-45X; 093-603-196-143-691; 099-073-210-827-698; 100-414-295-011-159; 102-295-670-617-763; 104-125-049-378-531; 104-482-850-487-165; 107-609-779-268-967; 121-137-140-578-627; 122-779-428-131-390; 123-662-800-015-589; 123-765-834-798-018; 125-046-318-507-415; 137-825-348-730-149; 139-461-070-642-889; 142-319-639-758-407; 149-629-593-463-037; 155-876-899-875-611; 160-308-463-148-240; 161-262-219-718-657; 172-903-221-839-999; 176-951-022-978-947; 189-636-159-890-26X; 190-430-993-277-901; 192-676-230-620-33X; 198-630-912-306-238,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

A Cross-Atlantic Perspective,2005-09-01,2005.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Philipp Hartmann; Stefan Straetmans; Casper G. de Vries,"This paper derives indicators of the severity and structure of banking system risk from asymptotic interdependencies between banks’ equity prices. We use new tools available from multivariate extreme value theory to estimate individual banks’ exposure to each other (“contagion risk”) and to systematic risk. By applying structural break tests to those measures we study whether capital markets indicate changes in the importance of systemic risk over time. Using data for the United States and the euro area, we can also compare banking system stability between the two largest economies in the world. For Europe we assess the relative importance of cross-border bank spillovers as compared to domestic bank spillovers. The results suggest, inter alia, that systemic risk in the US is higher than in the euro area, mainly as cross-border risks are still relatively mild in Europe. On both sides of the Atlantic systemic risk has increased during the 1990s.

This framework allows us to analyse and quantify tail interdependence at different levels of extremity, decompose it into systemic and residual part and to measure the contribution of a constituent to the interdependence of a system. In particular, tail interdependence can capture simultaneous distress of the constituents of a (financial or economic) system and measure its systemic risk. We investigate systemic distress in several financial datasets confirming some known stylized facts and discovering some new findings.

However, whether the reality that asset prices are not informational efficient is an opportunity for profit or a systemic risk of the financial system that needs to be corrected is still a ubiquitous concept, so many economic participants and research scholars have conducted related studies in order to understand the phenomenon of the financial market. This research employed attention entropy of the log-returns of 27 global assets to analyze the time-varying informational efficiency. International markets could be classified hierarchically into groups with similar long-term efficiency trends; however, at the same time, the ranks and clusters were found to remain stable only for a short period of time in terms of short-term efficiency. Therefore, a complex network representation analysis was performed to express whether the short-term efficiency patterns have interacted with each other over time as a coherent picture. It was confirmed that the network of 27 international markets was fully connected, strongly globalized and entangled. In addition, the complex network was composed of two modular structures grouped together with similar efficiency dynamics. As a result, although the informational efficiency of financial markets may be globalized to a high-efficiency state, it shows a collective dynamics pattern in which the global system may fall into risk due to the spread of systemic risk.</jats:p>",6,10,562,562,Efficient-market hypothesis; Financial market; Systemic risk; Financial market efficiency; Economics; Complex network; Order (exchange); Financial economics; Business; Microeconomics; Finance; Computer science; Financial crisis; Stock market; Macroeconomics; Paleontology; Horse; World Wide Web; Biology,,,,National Research Foundation of Korea,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract6100562,,10.3390/fractalfract6100562,,,0,000-454-346-263-577; 004-406-113-251-718; 004-451-576-350-90X; 010-423-042-177-734; 014-439-503-283-081; 014-902-465-133-868; 015-422-339-778-159; 016-889-902-825-90X; 020-407-411-001-009; 024-470-739-770-394; 030-202-274-891-589; 033-060-482-248-537; 033-906-279-705-276; 036-992-009-794-283; 043-210-604-146-605; 043-790-662-872-158; 047-952-269-183-166; 052-308-813-990-548; 055-284-632-827-86X; 058-775-633-825-116; 061-966-092-473-241; 062-412-251-485-832; 063-959-693-635-653; 064-206-248-174-65X; 067-063-805-955-840; 069-509-686-269-413; 076-479-319-555-708; 080-546-368-819-636; 081-627-302-964-33X; 083-318-551-383-484; 087-458-604-033-980; 088-849-154-199-012; 091-762-440-563-846; 094-099-529-429-417; 104-621-236-843-462; 105-289-590-999-536; 108-947-334-757-053; 110-546-403-603-58X; 121-695-984-021-411; 123-852-597-121-067; 124-373-760-730-021; 134-899-825-151-24X; 144-441-266-130-167; 149-245-486-155-546; 190-624-303-228-420,1,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Wong; Kelvin Ho; Andrew Tsang,"This paper provides a non-technical summary of two recent empirical studies to shed light on key important issues regarding the implementation of loan-to-value (LTV) policy as a macroprudential tool, including its effectiveness, potential drawbacks and its transmission mechanism to improve financial stability. Empirical evidence suggests that LTV policy is effective in reducing systemic risk associated with boom-and-bust cycles in property markets. Although the LTV policy may be associated with higher liquidity constraints on homebuyers, we show that the mortgage insurance programme (MIP) can mitigate this drawback without undermining the effectiveness of LTV policy. Thus, MIPs play an important role in enhancing the net benefits of LTV policy. Concerning the transmission mechanism, empirical evidence suggests that the policy pass-through to property market activities may be weak. By contrast, there is clear evidence that tightening LTV cap would reduce household leverage and credit growth, and that lower leverage plays a major role in strengthening banksi¯ resilience to property price shocks. This finding supports the view that household leverage would be an optimal target of LTV policy.",,,,,Empirical research; Systemic risk; Economics; Loan-to-value ratio; Empirical evidence; Market liquidity; Drawback; Monetary economics; Leverage (finance); Mortgage insurance,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hkmwpaper/202015.htm https://ideas.repec.org/p/hkm/wpaper/202015.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/hkmwpaper/202015.htm,,,3125532486,,0,,0,False,,,lens

This article aims to explain the divergence between societal debate and biosafety legislation and presents approaches to bring both together. The article reviews the development of biosafety regulations in the USA and the EU, focussing on diverging concepts applied for assessing the risks of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The dominant environmental risk assessment methodology has been developed to answer basic questions to enable expedient decision making. As a first step, methodologies that take into account complex environmental and landscape aspects should be applied. Expanding the scope of risk assessment, more holistic concepts have been developed, for example the Organisation for Econonomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concept of systemic risks which includes socio-economic aspects. International bodies as the OECD, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the European Union (EU) have developed the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as an instrument that includes the additional aspects of risk assessment as demanded by many stakeholders. Interestingly, there had been no attempts yet to link the existing frameworks of GMO risk assessment and SEA. It is recommended to adapt current models of SEA to assess the systemic risks of GMOs. It is also suggested to revise the EU GMO legislation to promote the inclusion of SEA elements.",23,1,1,11,Environmental resource management; Risk assessment; Business; Systemic risk; Legislation; Convention on Biological Diversity; Strategic environmental assessment; European union; Biosafety; Regulation of genetic engineering; Environmental planning,,,,,http://www.enveurope.com/content/pdf/2190-4715-23-7.pdf https://www.ensser.org/fileadmin/files/1.1-Meyer-paper.pdf https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2190-4715-23-7 https://core.ac.uk/display/81272603 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-4715-23-7/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F2190-4715-23-7.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2190-4715-23-7 https://paperity.org/p/4027906/systemic-risks-of-genetically-modified-crops-the-need-for-new-approaches-to-risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2190-4715-23-7,,10.1186/2190-4715-23-7,2143791412,,0,001-236-041-033-018; 003-368-525-528-524; 003-746-465-528-017; 004-726-173-899-113; 004-824-640-931-40X; 006-436-230-383-429; 007-140-354-560-216; 007-807-376-744-000; 008-526-880-266-584; 008-769-493-823-199; 009-572-299-790-247; 011-982-891-788-836; 013-809-496-120-59X; 013-839-976-117-821; 015-195-264-581-580; 015-256-047-978-334; 017-659-981-497-31X; 018-019-529-016-605; 019-477-694-262-652; 019-832-933-616-90X; 020-368-316-900-576; 021-297-894-151-141; 022-003-003-320-15X; 022-667-396-401-859; 023-352-724-275-733; 024-257-862-757-870; 025-820-483-248-298; 026-387-098-205-234; 026-950-563-360-994; 027-950-072-014-276; 029-648-109-901-545; 030-706-416-987-519; 030-850-756-792-132; 030-940-983-158-472; 031-662-924-373-630; 033-386-773-466-403; 033-990-866-503-008; 035-845-612-446-64X; 037-432-956-555-396; 038-543-990-602-73X; 040-083-611-752-250; 040-563-340-403-579; 040-588-177-352-302; 041-952-924-248-643; 042-002-569-100-827; 042-468-514-748-727; 046-124-028-435-115; 047-698-962-860-451; 048-573-262-170-617; 050-749-698-945-338; 051-346-054-480-483; 052-858-866-046-717; 053-025-799-815-984; 054-483-230-178-33X; 054-520-952-100-251; 055-924-264-137-728; 056-238-575-681-727; 059-160-117-176-901; 059-765-171-534-740; 064-856-641-171-767; 071-445-333-761-682; 074-773-175-807-703; 081-597-785-219-320; 083-367-248-802-288; 084-218-886-294-22X; 084-271-310-092-126; 086-138-207-274-546; 087-260-849-903-979; 087-606-004-090-844; 093-680-032-190-378; 094-007-982-691-420; 094-504-245-560-911; 096-711-593-984-299; 099-050-768-746-238; 111-523-057-236-899; 115-755-440-578-347; 117-227-127-419-984; 117-783-672-648-51X; 124-401-261-113-85X; 130-380-642-300-082; 140-035-575-016-713; 157-900-565-871-020; 161-372-002-038-367; 170-345-477-644-240; 176-236-887-149-694; 177-627-017-853-287,78,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Stiglitz,"Abstract Financial networks have shown to be important in understanding systemic events in credit markets. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of those networks can affect the capacity of regulators to assess the level of systemic risk. We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses. We further quantify the effects of cyclicality, leverage, volatility and correlations. Our results are relevant to the current policy discussions on new regulatory framework to deal with systemic events of distress as well as on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.",35,,93,106,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Financial networks; Probability of default; Affect (psychology); Leverage (finance); Volatility (finance); Interconnectedness; Estimation,,,,FNRS of Belgium's French Community; FET Project SIMPOL; FET project DOLFINS; Swiss National Fund Professorship; INET research program on Financial Stability,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572308916302200 https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-1xyj-8234 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572308916302200 https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-5ry0-qx88/download https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/finsta/v35y2018icp93-106.html https://www.zora.uzh.ch/165439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfs.2016.12.003,,10.1016/j.jfs.2016.12.003,3125983488,,0,002-398-719-067-333; 003-564-581-123-415; 011-009-251-260-182; 013-001-462-839-772; 013-118-111-585-482; 018-209-392-602-415; 020-586-688-906-501; 023-920-010-872-504; 025-303-272-106-219; 025-915-350-487-916; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-585-148-833-506; 034-618-882-762-654; 038-670-586-706-918; 045-777-161-498-037; 046-240-245-425-130; 048-297-576-911-977; 050-870-877-221-655; 058-879-947-933-394; 062-665-995-202-765; 063-747-800-214-332; 064-910-367-538-734; 073-141-158-334-957; 077-436-811-650-375; 078-964-547-449-925; 088-149-451-347-256; 095-037-640-171-955; 095-204-109-595-417; 106-840-243-371-267; 139-252-933-035-806; 157-175-836-991-739; 182-401-964-998-619,79,True,,green,lens

To fill this gap, this paper develops a framework that facilitates the analysis of both the direct effects of macroeconomic shocks on the solvency of individual banks and feedback effects that allow for the amplification and propagation of shocks that can result from bank deleveraging and credit crunches. The framework ensures consistency in the key relationships between macroeconomic and financial variables, and banks' balance sheets. This is accomplished by embedding a standard stress-testing framework based on individual banks' data in a semi-structural macroeconomic model. The framework has numerous applications that can strengthen stress testing and macro financial analysis. Moreover, it provides an avenue for many extensions that address the challenges of incorporating other second-round effects important for comprehensive systemic risk analysis, such as interactions between solvency, liquidity and contagion risks. To this end, the paper presents some preliminary simulations of feedback effects arising from the link between the liquidity and solvency risk.",,,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Macro; Credit crunch; Balance sheet; Market liquidity; Solvency; Deleveraging; Monetary economics; Macroeconomic model,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3014079,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3014079,,,3124081500,,0,,0,False,,,lens

We consider the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) approach to estimate the systemic risk of the given economies at 5% quantile (for severe downturn risk) and 20% quantile (for moderate downturn risk). Our findings demonstrate a rise in systemic risk for these Asian countries in 2020, particularly in the first half of the year. The findings also provide evidence of the significant systemic risk transmission from the US banking sector and the US stock market to the majority of the given Asian economies at both quantiles. The study further highlights the significant contribution of the US financial market in increasing the systemic risk of the given Asian economies in 2020. We find similar results for systemic risk transmission from the UK, the European Union, and Japan to the given Asian economies. The findings have implications for market participants, risk managers, and regulators who are concerned with risk diversification and tracking the routes of risk shock transmission.

Gimbrone,"Intimal lipid accumulation, hyperplasia, and scarring are stigmata of atherosclerotic vascular disease, whose major complications—myocardial and cerebral ischemia and infarction—continue to be major health problems in developed nations. 1 This insidiously progressive disease typically spans decades, but can reach a clinical horizon in a matter of minutes due to critical changes in a given atherosclerotic plaque that result in localized but life-threatening thrombosis. Epidemiological studies have established that hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor in this disease process, and lipid-lowering drugs have been proven to have clinical efficacy. Experimental animals that are fed lipid-rich diets to elevate their plasma cholesterol levels also can develop atherosclerotic-like lesions, as do animals with naturally occurring or genetically engineered mutations that result in altered cholesterol metabolism. However, regardless of a given patient’s risk factor profile, species of animal model, or type of natural or engineered genetic alteration, the early, lipid-rich lesions of atherosclerosis show a markedly nonrandom pattern of distribution within the arterial vasculature. Atherosclerotic lesions typically develop in the vicinity of branch points and areas of major curvature. These arterial geometries are associated with blood flow disturbances such as nonuniform laminar flow with boundary layer separation, complex secondary flows with flow reversal and dynamic stagnation points, and resultant temporal and spatial gradients in wall shear stresses. In contrast to these atherosclerosis-prone areas, unbranched, tubular arterial geometries, which are associated with a more uniformly laminar flow profile, characteristically are relatively atherosclerosis-resistant, at least in the early phases of the disease. This strikingly localized pattern of lesion formation, even in the face of systemic risk factors such as elevated plasma cholesterol, has intrigued experimental pathologists and fluid mechanical engineers alike for decades, and has motivated the search for a mechanistic link between hemodynamic forces and atherogenesis.",155,1,1,5,Pathology; Blood flow; Hemodynamics; Arteriosclerosis; Endothelium; Hyperplasia; Thrombosis; Risk factor; Ischemia; Biology,,"Animals; Arteriosclerosis/etiology; Endothelium, Vascular/physiology; Hemodynamics/physiology; Humans",,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944010650900 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10393828/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1866678 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1866678 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10393828,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65090-0,10393828,10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65090-0,2138758296,PMC1866678,1,004-268-872-019-132; 004-953-004-860-525; 005-600-924-478-671; 006-583-959-076-415; 006-941-920-033-896; 007-105-595-595-838; 008-685-096-785-186; 009-700-448-423-293; 015-249-425-480-141; 017-650-930-036-352; 017-709-266-776-961; 018-943-816-802-231; 023-448-856-364-646; 032-079-706-243-57X; 032-311-538-480-122; 034-237-061-813-62X; 034-935-509-093-578; 036-243-843-340-605; 038-720-817-431-900; 039-359-420-080-331; 041-881-328-240-05X; 043-685-788-613-165; 052-066-704-372-565; 061-411-388-626-754; 062-212-076-894-56X; 063-929-330-582-33X; 067-321-209-875-376; 068-461-875-257-933; 071-268-954-238-611; 080-842-774-676-999; 086-885-598-191-383; 097-071-577-913-611; 098-077-735-827-916; 100-004-497-334-405; 101-115-377-109-949; 105-059-540-454-673; 117-016-272-817-655; 132-803-403-428-470; 167-288-743-049-510,245,True,,green,lens

Einmahl; L. de Haan; Chen Zhou,"Abstract: Denote the loss return on the equity of a financial institution as X and that of the entire market as Y . For a given very small value of p > 0, the marginal expected shortfall (MES) is defined as E(X | Y > QY (1−p)), where QY (1−p) is the (1−p)-th quantile of the distribution of Y . The MES is an important factor when measuring the systemic risk of financial institutions. For a wide nonparametric class of bivariate distributions, we construct an estimator of the MES and establish the asymptotic normality of the estimator when p ↓ 0, as the sample size n → ∞. Since we are in particular interested in the case p = O(1=n), we use extreme value techniques for deriving the estimator and its asymptotic behavior. The finite sample performance of the estimator and the adequacy of the limit theorem are shown in a detailed simulation study. We also apply our method to estimate the MES of three large U.S. investment banks.",,,,,Nonparametric statistics; Statistics; Quantile; Sample size determination; Extreme value theory; Estimator; Mathematics; Expected shortfall; Bivariate analysis; Asymptotic distribution,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/tiu/tiucen/e96e039f-cb6b-4cd5-805b-5611a64257f5.html https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/tiutiucen/e96e039f-cb6b-4cd5-805b-5611a64257f5.htm,https://ideas.repec.org/p/tiu/tiucen/e96e039f-cb6b-4cd5-805b-5611a64257f5.html,,,3087979968,,0,,0,False,,,lens

In our analysis we assume that the stock quotations of insurance companies reflect market sentiments which constitute a very important systemic risk factor. Interlinkages between insurers and their dynamics have a direct impact on systemic risk contagion in the insurance sector. We propose herein a new hybrid approach to the analysis of interlinkages dynamics based on combining the copula-DCC-GARCH model and Minimum Spanning Trees (MST). Using the copula-DCC-GARCH model we determine the tail dependence coefficients. Then, for each analysed period we construct MST based on these coefficients. The dynamics is analysed by means of time series of selected topological indicators of the MSTs in the years 2005-2019. Our empirical results show the usefulness of the proposed approach to the analysis of systemic risk in the insurance sector. The times series obtained from the proposed hybrid approach reflect the phenomena occurring on the market. The analysed MST topological indicators can be considered as systemic risk predictors.",,,,,Topology; Systemic risk; Economics; Construct (philosophy); Tail dependence; Hybrid approach; Stock (geology); Market price,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2001.06567.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2001.06567.html,,,3123764630,,0,,0,False,,,lens
043-890-110-400-062,Market Myopia's Climate Bubble,,2021.0,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Madison Condon,"A growing number of financial institutions, ranging from BlackRock to the Bank of England, have warned that markets may not be accurately incorporating climate change-related risks into asset prices. This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing occurs, drawing from scholarship on corporate governance and the mechanisms of market (in)efficiency. Market actors: (1) Lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to assess risk exposure; (2) Continue to rely on outdated means of assessing risk; (3) Have misaligned incentives resulting in climate-specific agency costs; (4) Have myopic biases exacerbated by climate change misinformation; and (5) Are impeded by captured regulators distorting the market. Further, trends in institutional share ownership reinforce apathy toward assessment of firm-specific fundamentals, especially over long-term horizons. ; ; This underpricing of corporate climate risk contributes to the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of risk in the present leads to a misallocation of investment capital, hindering adaptation and subsidizing future combustion of fossil fuels. These risks could accumulate to the macroeconomic scale, generating a systemic risk to the financial system. While a broad array of government interventions are necessary to mitigate climate-related financial risks, this Article focuses on proposals for corporate governance and securities regulation—and their limits. The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently drafting a rule on mandatory climate risk disclosure. This Article argues that the SEC should seek out climate expertise through interagency collaboration and staff hiring, work with auditors and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and provide guidance on climate risk analytics. This Article argues that climate risk disclosure is necessary, though alone not sufficient, to address the widespread disregard of corporate climate exposure.",,,,,Public economics; Effects of global warming; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Financial market; Asset (economics); Climate risk; Corporate governance; Financial risk,,,,,https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2084&context=faculty_scholarship https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/1087/ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782675,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3782675,,10.2139/ssrn.3782675,3138184352,,0,052-885-948-072-517; 084-265-315-070-830; 087-901-980-517-771; 148-228-212-171-871,1,True,,green,lens

The ratio of non-core to core liabilities in the banking system can reflect the stage of financial cycle and the degree of risk-taking of the banking. This paper analyses the pro-cyclicality of non-core liabilities and short-term liabilities of the banking and the connection between both liabilities and systemic risk. The results reveal that during the boom, non-core and short-term liabilities grow rapidly with the expansion of the balance sheets of the banking, which increases the systamic risk. Along with the extension of intermediation chains in the banking, systemic maturity mismatch exacerbates and thus systemic risk intensifies. Therefore, regulators should adopt various counter-cyclical instruments to mitigate the pro-cyclicality in the banking system.",,,,,Finance; Boom; Business; Systemic risk; Current liability; Balance sheet; Intermediation; Maturity (finance); Financial system; Financial risk; Systematic risk,,,,,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-CSJR201107008.htm,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-CSJR201107008.htm,,,2355795729,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Its main topological features are examined applying graph theory, focusing on the unsecured overnight loans settled from 2003 to 2017. The network, where banks are the nodes and the operations between them represent the links, exhibits low density, a higher reciprocity than comparable random graphs, short average distances and its clustering coefficient remains above that of a random network of equal size. Furthermore, the network is prominently disassortative. Its structural metrics experienced significant volatility, in correlation with the economic activity fluctuations and regulatory shifts. Signs of nodes' random-like behavior are detected during contractions. The degree distributions fit better to a Lognormal distribution than to a Poisson or a Power Law. Additionally, different node centrality measures are computed. It is found that a higher centrality enables a node to settle more convenient bilateral interest rates compared to the average market rate, identifying a statistical and economically significant effect by means of a regression analysis. These results constitute a relevant input for systemic risk assessment and provide solid empirical foundations for future theoretical modelling and shock simulations, especially in the context of underdeveloped financial systems.",8,4,,,Econometrics; Interest rate; Network topology; Clustering coefficient; Money market; Reciprocity (network science); Computer science; Node (networking); Random graph; Centrality; Reciprocity (social psychology); Network analysis; Graph theory,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article-abstract/8/4/cnaa039/6095688,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnaa039,,10.1093/comnet/cnaa039,3119580432; 3088300533,,0,002-637-578-167-175; 004-835-689-488-844; 005-818-255-004-808; 006-094-098-568-815; 011-050-465-179-202; 013-001-462-839-772; 013-118-111-585-482; 015-904-557-770-763; 018-755-241-682-348; 018-814-147-267-436; 019-687-296-589-620; 020-586-688-906-501; 025-586-221-515-330; 029-652-108-487-444; 030-126-254-051-679; 030-582-421-227-58X; 033-710-714-841-404; 036-050-969-425-005; 040-801-336-012-314; 041-554-182-648-360; 042-084-378-967-657; 045-777-161-498-037; 048-780-134-846-231; 051-260-326-272-155; 054-851-463-923-691; 059-892-930-642-905; 061-026-314-365-423; 063-190-811-897-241; 065-327-126-170-308; 072-113-379-743-821; 072-591-473-662-709; 075-435-962-988-288; 076-660-734-865-574; 086-913-430-474-676; 090-328-172-692-220; 094-768-047-721-277; 096-466-369-466-263; 105-395-385-823-338; 106-840-243-371-267; 107-007-099-256-403; 119-163-879-439-817; 123-699-515-895-205; 127-548-643-861-269; 131-597-224-152-80X; 139-216-072-180-885; 143-041-631-960-072; 149-706-715-061-703; 161-352-792-186-592; 180-367-349-677-312; 197-559-673-806-458,0,True,,green,lens

Dooley,"Background: In 1989, skin-sparing mastectomy started at a number of breast centers in the United States because of an increasing demand for immediate reconstruction and a desire for better cosmetic outcomes. Methods: To ensure the safety of this new approach, we have reviewed the personal series of a single surgeon using a standardized skin-sparing technique during 1989 to 2004. Results: Skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction was performed on 225 patients, and standard mastectomy was performed on 1,022 patients. The age distribution was 8 years younger on average in the reconstructed group. The average follow-up for each group was 49 months. The local recurrence for each group was 1.7% and 1.5% (P .80). The regional recurrence was 3.8% and 3.9% (P .80). The average time to local recurrence was similar in each group (33.1 and 32.6 months, P .80).

We base our analysis on new findings in the field of ideational shifts and regulatory science, which posit that change-agents engage with new ideas pragmatically and strategically in their effort to have their economic ideas institutionalized. We argue that in these epistemic battles over new regulation, scientific backing by academia is the key resource determining the outcome. We show that the present reforms implemented internationally follow this pattern. In our analysis we contrast the entire discourse on systemic risk and macroprudential regulation with Borio's initial 2003 proposal for a macroprudential framework. We find that mostly cross-sectional measures targeted towards increasing the resilience of the financial system rather than inter-temporal measures dampening the financial cycle have been implemented. We provide evidence for the lacking support of new macroprudential thinking within academia and argue that this is partially responsible for the lack of anti-cyclical macroprudential regulation. Most worryingly, the financial cycle is largely absent in the academic discourse and is only tacitly assumed instead of fully fledged out in technocratic discourses, pointing to the possibility that no anti-cyclical measures will be forthcoming.",,,,,Positive economics; Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Political science; Order (exchange); Technocracy; Regulatory science; Macroprudential regulation; Field (Bourdieu); Resource (project management),,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195910 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:zbw:safewp:214,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3195910,,10.2139/ssrn.3195910,2910377644,,0,003-898-062-372-559; 005-270-496-446-833; 009-037-663-720-911; 015-081-868-584-998; 024-828-296-919-906; 027-549-199-465-903; 028-915-737-614-894; 045-671-801-676-212; 057-402-900-794-556; 069-078-077-310-036; 070-531-678-856-112; 074-742-877-053-350; 093-193-088-931-608; 097-352-194-138-508; 099-340-473-967-610; 101-646-836-597-252; 105-398-088-201-827; 111-719-910-096-809; 112-117-632-281-526; 126-898-133-101-255; 136-579-790-583-746; 156-206-206-007-752; 181-709-557-804-738; 184-996-681-717-686,1,True,,green,lens

This distribution provides the probabilities that several assets of a market lose a large part of their nominal value given that the price of at least one of them collapses. It introduces a new way of assessing the stability of a financial market during potential systemic risk events. We propose a new type of multivariate extreme value distribution for high-dimensional vectors to model the extremal dependence between asset prices, and we use efficient likelihood inference methods to estimate the parameters of the systemic tail risk distribution.

McCabe; Marco Cipriani; Michael Holscher; Antoine Martin,"This paper introduces a proposal for money market fund (MMF) reform to mitigate the systemic risk and externalities that arise from the funds' vulnerability to runs and to protect shareholders who do not redeem quickly when runs occur. Our proposal would require that a small fraction of each MMF shareholder's recent balances, called the ""minimum balance at risk"" (MBR), be available for redemption only with a delay of 30 days. Most regular transactions in the fund would be unaffected; the requirement would only affect redemptions of the shareholder's MBR. In addition, in the rare event that a fund suffers losses, the MBRs of investors who have recently made large redemptions would absorb losses before those of nonredeeming investors. This subordination of redeeming investors' MBRs would create a disincentive to redeem if the fund is likely to have losses, but would have little effect on incentives when the risk of loss is remote. We use empirical evidence, including a novel data set from the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on MMF losses in 2008, to calibrate an MBR rule that would reduce the vulnerability of MMFs to runs.",2013,1,211,278,Finance; Financial economics; Shareholder; Business; Systemic risk; Open-end fund; Money market; Balance (accounting); Risk of loss; Treasury; Money market fund,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-351948046/the-minimum-balance-at-risk-a-proposal-to-mitigate https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/60899 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2126235 https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/the-minimum-balance-at-risk-a-proposal-to-mitigate-the-systemic-risks-posed-by-money-market-funds.htm https://muse.jhu.edu/article/524138/summary https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2012/201247/201247pap.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/bin/bpeajo/v44y2013i2013-01p211-278.html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2191778_code358088.pdf?abstractid=2191778&mirid=1 https://core.ac.uk/display/102004849 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2126235_code387943.pdf?abstractid=2126235 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4263301 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bin:bpeajo:v:44:y:2013:i:2013-01:p:211-278 https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/60899/1/720243955.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/eca.2013.0003,,10.1353/eca.2013.0003,1981728906,,0,002-699-182-862-378; 012-165-356-729-62X; 038-443-903-000-83X; 053-194-698-585-347; 066-722-517-188-296; 082-768-693-678-765; 099-624-920-161-462; 122-555-389-898-069; 151-428-141-657-851; 160-933-036-475-670,21,True,,green,lens

This study constructs a tail risk network to present overall systemic risk of Chinese financial institutions, given the macroeconomic and market externalities. Employing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method of high-dimensional models, our results show that firm's idiosyncratic risk can be affected by its connectedness with other institutions. The risk spillover effect from other companies is the main driving factor of firm-specific risk, comparing with macroeconomic state, firm characteristics and historical price movement. The number of connections between institutions significantly increases during June 2014 to June 2016. Moreover, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to test significance of systemic risk beta based on tail risk and further rank the systemic risk contribution. Finally, we test the determinants of systemic risk contribution in a forward-looking way.

Bank credit has collapsed reflecting both weak demand and tighter supply. New prudential requirements have improved the resilience of the banking sector and a number of measures were taken to support credit supply. These included conventional and unconventional monetary policies, policies to address credit constraints with Help to Buy and Funding for Lending programmes, and a number of public programmes to improve access to finance united under the roof of the British Business Bank. Further structural reforms are needed to improve competition in the SME credit market and to boost credit provision to SMEs in the medium term. Sustainable financing of the economy and greater financial stability should be achieved by sound regulation, ensuring high capital requirements for systemically important banks, improving banks’ resolvability and fine-tuning the use of countercyclical measures. Data should be collected on a wider set of financial institutions than currently done and macroprudential regulation should be gradually extended beyond the banking sector to prevent the migration of systemic risks. ; This Working Paper relates to the 2015 OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-united-kingdom.htm)",,,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Bond market; Deleveraging; Macroprudential regulation; Resilience (organizational); Access to finance; Competition (economics); Capital requirement,,,,,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/enhancing-the-financing-of-the-real-economy-and-financial-stability-in-the-united-kingdom_5jrxqbk75c43.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpaper%2F5jrxqbk75c43-en https://racacachorros.com/meningkatkan-pembiayaan-ekonomi-riil-dan-stabilitas-keuangan-di-inggris-raya-makalah-kerja-departemen-ekonomi-oecd/ https://ideas.repec.org/p/oec/ecoaaa/1245-en.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:oec:ecoaaa:1245-en https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/enhancing-the-financing-of-the-real-economy-and-financial-stability-in-the-united-kingdom_5jrxqbk75c43-en https://pocket-bishonen.com/meningkatkan-pembiayaan-ekonomi-riil-dan-stabilitas-keuangan-di-inggris-raya-makalah-kerja-departemen-ekonomi-oecd/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5jrxqbk75c43-en,,10.1787/5jrxqbk75c43-en,2163832932,,0,002-403-581-229-726; 016-665-645-839-960; 023-748-444-546-990; 025-660-628-506-439; 030-425-862-674-538; 032-843-195-939-84X; 034-142-492-433-950; 036-665-101-659-094; 037-596-405-241-236; 040-008-086-577-801; 068-165-964-946-662; 072-752-524-486-456; 072-925-590-788-957; 076-534-221-402-964; 104-340-497-576-541; 111-004-723-165-566; 122-779-428-131-390; 132-760-208-192-784; 148-809-996-009-594; 151-965-031-564-666; 152-741-633-138-668; 154-884-099-236-073; 182-306-075-049-119; 199-036-819-127-715,4,True,,bronze,lens

In the context of access to justice, the relevant systemic risk is one of futility: a rational litigant’s inability to vindicate a meritorious claim. Proving the required facts in the context of judicial review proceedings is not an easy task. Litigants must look beyond the realisation of harm to the mechanisms which put access to justice at risk.

101-273-020-897-974,Network analysis of the EU insurance sector,2015-07-01,2015.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Ivan Alves; Jeroen Brinkhoff; Stanislav Georgiev; Jean-Cyprien Héam; Iulia Moldovan; Marco Scotto di Carlo,"This paper contains an analysis of the network of the 29 largest European insurance groups and their financial counterparties. Insurance companies have direct exposures to other insurers, banks and other financial institutions through the holdings of debt, equity and other financial instruments. These exposures can cause direct contagion and thereby the spread of systemic risks. This analysis focuses on direct linkages between EU insurers and banks. Sectoral data show that at least 20% of insurers’ assets are investments in banks. As a result insurers are an important source of funding for banks. This paper adds to the expanding research on financial market networks and on systemic risks in the insurance sector. This paper considers these 29 insurers’ top ten exposures for each instrument. They represent about 10% of their total assets, which indicates a low level of concentration. More than half of the reported exposures result from investments in bonds issued by banks. In addition, some insurers have a higher exposure to banks within their own financial conglomerate. Other exposures reported include securities lending transactions and repos (both mostly collateralised with cash), as well as interest rate swaps. The network of insurance groups, banks and other financial institutions displays low interconnectivity overall, compared for instance to the interactions of the largest EU banks alone. The density of the network is relatively low. The characteristics of this network illustrate that credit and funding events cannot be expected to spread easily through direct contagion. The network shows a core-periphery structure, which partly results from the scope of the data collection: only 29 insurance groups reported exposures, and thus they form the core, while institutions from which no information was collected are in the periphery. However, the systemic importance of a few insurance groups stands out. These groups show higher levels of connectivity, proximity to credit events within the network, and importance for financial flows. Network measures for each of these aspects refer to the criteria of interconnectedness and substitutability, which are well-known in the policy debate on the systemic relevance of financial institutions. While the particular form of institutional importance varies significantly across insurance groups, the central role of a few “champions” in this network may require supervisory attention. Size, in terms of total assets and issued capital is an important factor but not the only one, determiningan insurer’s centrality in the network. Measures of the centrality of the banking counterparties also show a positive, non-linear relationship with the size of the banks. Distress in the network, as expected, causes only limited direct contagion. Insurers’ solvency positions are sufficiently large and their concentration of exposures is sufficiently low as to avoid direct contagion from a default of one of their counterparties, ultimately leading to their own default. This is also true for simultaneous distress at their top ten banking counterparties, with the exception of two insurance groups. The analysis presented is partial, as it relies only on the information collected. In particular, the analysis would benefit from including the exposures of banks and other financial institutions to insurers. This could be a useful enhancement for consideration in the future.

Using daily data of the ISE-100 stock index from 2005 to 2012 and Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, we test the liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model (L-CAPM) of Acharya and Pedersen (2005). Performing cross-sectional regression tests across test portfolios, we find supporting evidence that illiquidity is significantly and positively priced. Specifically, our results indicate that liquidity risk arising from the commonality in liquidity is the most important component of liquidity risk. The strong interrelationship between the market liquidity and the liquidity of individual stocks suggests that market-wide shocks on the Istanbul Stock Exchange might quickly affect every stock in this market. Hence, liquidity commonality might create a systemic risk in which case liquidity shocks can be perfectly correlated across all stocks. Our study is the first to investigate stock liquidity-return relationship at daily frequency and to apply the L-CAPM on the Turkish stock markets. Our findings provide interesting conclusions for investors, risk managers and regulators in emerging economies, and in particular, Turkey. Investors should incorporate liquidity risk into their trading and hedging strategies to improve their risk profile and increase their investment returns. Furthermore, an improved understanding of systemic liquidity is vital for regulatory authorities to design improved regulations against systemic shocks.",,,,,Emerging markets; Business; Systemic risk; Capital asset pricing model; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Stock exchange; Monetary economics; Stock (geology); Stock market index,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/56148.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/56148.html,,,3146174916,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The approach also highlights temporal dynamics of the network, e.g. how global shifts in network structure coincide with severe crisis episodes.

163-442-724-262-778,Regulatory Practices of Money Broking Business in Selected Countries,2009-10-15,2009.0,journal article,Staff Studies,13913743,Sri Lanka Journals Online (JOL),,Rupa Dheerasinghe,"Since 1980 Money Brokers (MBs) have been operating in Sri Lanka as key players in the inter bank call money market, government securities market and foreign exchange market. Money broking firms start operation after obtaining a ‘no objection' letter from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Currently, neither the CBSL nor any other regulatory authority regulate or supervise these institutions. Therefore, this paper intends to examine regulatory practices of money broking companies in selected countries with the view of assessing the need for and the scope of regulating money broking firms in Sri Lanka. This study is based on the information collected from 21 Central Banks/Monitory Authorities in various countries of the world, where responses were obtained through an e-mail survey conducted in late 2004. The study clearly indicates that whenever, the firms are only involved in traditional money broking activities i.e., act as an agent between lender and borrower for a commission, authorities do not regulate or supervise their activities mainly because they do not hold public funds and therefore, no systemic risk is involved. However, majority of the countries in the sample issue license or other form of approval mainly for maintaining the professional standards and monitoring the developments in this sector. In many countries, self regulatory organizations hold the responsibility of supervising and regulating money broking activities. The paper concludes that the money broking industry in Sri Lanka too needs to develop a self regulatory framework to persuade firms to maintain self discipline within the industry preferably through the existing Money Brokers Association and that the Association should endeavour to enhance its reputation by introducing quality services and practice to its members and to the market and eventually achieve the recognition of the authorities.

BPF is identified in over 80% of patients at presentation. Optimal management includes prevention by minimizing perioperative sepsis, meticulous bronchial closure, and the use of vascularized flaps to reinforce the bronchial stump. Management of the developed complication requires flexible bronchoscopy, drainage of the empyema space initially by closed tube drainage, and later by open thoracostomy, appropriate therapy of the underlying infection, and identification and correction of systemic risk factors. Surgical interventions to obliterate the residual empyema space are successful in 80% of cases. Closure of BPF occurs spontaneously in one third of cases, but can be achieved in 86% of cases with aggressive surgical interventions involving reclosure of the bronchial stump and transposition of vascularized flaps. The mortality of postpneumonectomy empyema, with or without BPF, ranges from 23% to 50%. The mortality for surgical intervention is 10%.

Rachev,"Despite the potential importance of crime rates in investments, there are no indices dedicated to evaluating the financial impact of crime in the United States. As such, this paper presents an index-based insurance portfolio for crime in the United States by utilizing the financial losses reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The objective of our paper is to introduce new risk hedging financial contracts for crime, consistent with dynamic asset pricing. Underlying the index, we hedge the investments by issuing marketable European call and put options and providing risk budgets. These budgets show that real estate, ransomware, and government impersonation are the main risk contributors in our index. Next, we evaluate the performance of our index via stress testing to determine its resilience to economic crisis. Of all the factors considered in this study, unemployment rate has the potential to demonstrate the highest systemic risk to the portfolio. Our portfolio will help investors envision risk exposure in the market, gauge investment risk based on their desired risk level, and hedge strategies for potential losses due to economic crashes. In conclusion, we provide a basis for the securitization of insurance risk from certain crimes that could forewarn investors to transfer their risk to capital market investors.",14,7,315,,Finance; Hedge (finance); Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Capital asset pricing model; Portfolio; Index (economics); Financial risk; Real estate,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jjrfmx/v14y2021i7p315-d591188.html https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/7/315 https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/7/315/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070315,,10.3390/jrfm14070315,3181661544,,0,003-682-110-096-067; 008-961-548-996-354; 009-641-034-178-892; 010-343-664-389-328; 011-978-376-483-155; 018-913-093-142-26X; 021-480-157-006-062; 022-801-098-356-572; 024-656-242-285-647; 028-939-014-061-081; 029-443-248-739-964; 032-274-049-869-719; 033-079-775-349-34X; 033-468-447-949-070; 035-014-823-490-790; 042-668-950-389-800; 053-760-432-750-687; 058-992-031-883-088; 065-641-305-378-679; 066-199-459-401-576; 071-786-631-073-98X; 071-822-808-161-420; 076-036-267-268-543; 083-697-455-425-261; 086-317-786-026-830; 108-534-489-147-107; 109-038-143-691-002; 109-490-211-998-710; 124-058-858-151-378; 130-763-812-635-298; 130-929-572-342-724; 132-869-779-562-047; 138-331-652-128-642; 145-833-224-516-423; 168-422-163-339-942; 178-332-961-008-295; 189-973-878-832-493; 198-995-741-059-616,0,True,cc-by,gold,lens

Shtein; Alan Sugar; H. Kaz Soong; Maria A. Woodward; Karen S. DeLoss; Shahzad I. Mian,"PURPOSE The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of 50% autologous serum (AS) eye drops after long-term use in a large cohort of patients with dry eyes. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients treated with 50% AS eye drops at our institution between June 2008 and January 2013. Records were reviewed for clinical history, systemic risk factors, dry eye etiology, patients' symptoms, and adverse events. Ocular surface evaluation included Schirmer testing with topical anesthesia, fluorescein staining, and ocular surface disease index. Data were reviewed at initial visit, 1 month, and every 3 to 6 months during treatment with AS. Paired t tests were performed to compare the progression of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. RESULTS A total of 123 eyes of 63 patients were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-48 months). Corneal fluorescein staining (mean baseline, 1.77 ± 1.1) improved at the 3- to <6-month, 6- to <12-month, and final follow-up (mean: 1.2 ± 1.0, 1.3 ± 1.0, and 1.1 ± 1.1; P = 0.003, 0.017, and 0.0003, respectively). Schirmer scores (mean baseline, 6.6 ± 6.5 mm) improved at the 12- to 24-month follow-up (mean = 10.7 ± 11.4, P = 0.03), whereas ocular surface disease index scores (mean baseline, 54.1 ± 22.3) improved at the 3- to <6- and 6- to <12-month follow-up (mean: 49.5 ± 8.2 and 39.3 ± 21.4, P = 0.029 and 0.003, respectively). No complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS Fifty percent AS eye drops seem to be a safe and effective long-term treatment for dry eye disease, especially in patients with severe disease who have exhausted all other conventional forms of treatment.",33,12,1245,1251,Ophthalmology; Etiology; Retrospective cohort study; Adverse effect; Cohort study; Disease; Ocular Surface Disease Index; In patient; Autologous serum; Medicine,,Aged; Blood Proteins/administration & dosage; Cohort Studies; Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosis; Female; Fluorophotometry; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmic Solutions/administration & dosage; Retrospective Studies; Serum; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tears/physiology; Treatment Outcome,Blood Proteins; Ophthalmic Solutions,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299423 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25299423/ https://www.academia.edu/22622700/Long_term_use_of_autologous_serum_50_eye_drops_for_the_treatment_of_dry_eye_disease,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000000271,25299423,10.1097/ico.0000000000000271,2115269697,,0,000-016-092-727-801; 001-562-499-690-427; 002-238-088-503-967; 002-474-678-366-485; 003-714-910-962-692; 007-673-878-565-175; 007-966-511-497-662; 008-674-903-942-229; 008-700-633-250-164; 011-274-409-688-566; 019-056-310-983-720; 020-455-322-660-631; 023-879-492-512-71X; 028-207-089-644-376; 028-841-705-008-970; 033-477-091-220-194; 034-846-167-649-112; 037-924-295-145-509; 038-556-756-836-178; 047-643-815-920-807; 048-134-968-743-339; 048-752-726-092-586; 048-757-728-244-216; 050-350-584-335-086; 050-408-923-778-607; 051-469-813-605-022; 052-069-698-585-436; 056-397-379-888-243; 058-552-478-430-65X; 064-372-886-071-034; 065-632-273-680-800; 069-397-651-251-72X; 072-310-489-184-285; 073-785-818-569-369; 077-155-769-969-09X; 097-566-405-121-268; 100-749-431-046-159; 101-914-215-541-908; 108-194-234-265-656; 112-455-953-516-623,47,False,,,lens

Methods In this cross-sectional study, 107 participants were divided in three groups. Totally 31 normal individuals (control group), 40 diabetic patients without DR (NDR group) and 36 patients with NPDR (NPDR group) were included. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to detect RNFL thickness and other optic disc parameters among different groups. The potential association between RNFL loss and systemic risk factors were assessed for DR, including diabetes duration, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum lipids, and blood pressure. Results The average and each quadrant RNFL thickness were thinner in NPDR group compared to control group of the right (P=0.00, P=0.01, P=0.01, P=0.02, P=0.04) and left eyes (P=0.00, P=0.00, P=0.00, P=0.03, P=0.04). The average, superior and inferior RNFL thickness were thinner in NDR group compared to the NPDR group of the right (P=0.00, P=0.02, P=0.03) and left eyes (P=0.00, P=0.00, P=0.01). Diabetic duration was negatively correlated with the superior, inferior, and average RNFL thickness of the right (r=-0.385, P=0.001; r=-0.366, P=0.001; r=-0.503, P=0.000) and left eyes (r=-0.271, P=0.018; r=0.278, P=0.015; r=-0.260, P=0.023). HbA1c was negatively correlated with the superior, inferior, and average RNFL thickness of the right (r=-0.316 P=0.005; r=-0.414, P=0.000; r=-0.418, P=0.000) and left eyes (r=-0.367, P=0.001; r=-0.250, P=0.030; r=-0.393, P=0.000). Systolic pressure was negatively correlated with the inferior and average RNFL thickness of the right eye (r=-0.402, P=0.000; r=-0.371, P=0.001) and was negatively correlated with the superior and average RNFL thickness of the left eye (r=-0.264, P=0.021; r=-0.233, P=0.043).

We build a network model of optimizing banks featuring contagion on both sides of banks' balance sheets. To already existing asset side channels (liquidity hoarding, interbank exposures and fire sales of common assets) we add a critical liability side channel of contagion, namely bank runs triggered by information coordination akin to global games. The model is calibrated to the network of large European banks by a simulated method of moments approach and by using the real-world interbank matrix as a prior for the maximum entropy estimation of the model-based interbank matrix. We use the model to study the effects of phase-in increases of liquidity coverage ratios. Interestingly we find that the systemic risk profile of the system is not improved and might even deteriorate. Based on those insights we propose an alternative approach: differential (across banks) increases in coverage ratios based on systemic importance rankings help to mitigate the externalities and deliver a much more stable system.",,,,,Global game; Business; Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Market liquidity; Asset (economics); Liability; Monetary economics; Method of simulated moments; Bank run,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2685675,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2685675,,,3121291029,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Kupiec,"Conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) have been proposed as stock return based measures of the systemic risk created by individual financial institutions even though the literature provides no formal hypothesis test for detecting systemic risk. We address this shortcoming by constructing hypothesis test statistics for CoVaR and MES that can be used to detect systemic risk at the institution level. We apply our tests to daily stock returns data for over 3500 firms during 2006-2007. CoVaR (MES) tests identify almost 500 (1000) firms as systemically important. Both tests identify many more real-side firms than financial firms, and they often disagree about which firms are systemic. Analysis of the hypothesis tests' performance for plausible alternative hypotheses finds that return skewness can cause test rejections and, even when systemic risk imparts a strong signal in stock return distributions, hypothesis tests based on CoVaR and MES may fail to detect it. Our overall conclusion is that CoVaR and MES are not reliable measures of systemic risk.",,,,,Alternative hypothesis; Skewness; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Stock return; Expected shortfall; Stock (geology); Statistical hypothesis testing,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/aei/rpaper/828488.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/aei/rpaper/828488.html,,,3124689708,,0,,0,False,,,lens

In particular, the paper investigates potential crisis contagion channels within the shadow banking system by analysing the interconnectedness of the shadow banking investment funds and highlighting the links within the internal structures of the investment funds and securitisation vehicles, as well as external relationships with credit institutions. The paper proposes a due-diligence tool for monitoring and controlling the build-up of systemic risk posed by any shadow banking investment fund. This macroprudential tool serves as an early warning system against the growing systemic vulnerabilities of the shadow banking entities.

This paper analyzes this intellectual shift by using discourse and citation-network analysis of the most-cited scholarly works on banking regulation and systemic risk from 1985 to 2014 and six in-depth interviews with central scholars. It demonstrates that the predominance of formalism, particularly partial equilibrium analysis, in studies on banking regulation pre-crisis impeded economists’ engagement with the endogenous sources of systemic risks discussed in the systemic risk sample. These studies excluded observed phenomena that could not be accommodated in mathematical models, largely ignoring contributions based on historical and practitioners’ styles of reasoning. Post-crisis, while informal analyses gain prominence in studies on banking regulation, attempts to conceptualize systemic risk as a negative externality indicate the persistence of formalism and equilibrium thinking and its concomitant epistemological limitations that stymie theoretical progress.",42,4,935,962,Positive economics; Systemic risk; Externality; Economics; Partial equilibrium; Macro; Network analysis; Formalism (philosophy),,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02184169 https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/140894/1/859626644.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:oup:cambje:v:42:y:2018:i:4:p:935-962. https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/140894 https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/42/4/935/4560163 https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/cambje/v42y2018i4p935-962..html https://spire.sciencespo.fr/hdl:/2441/rge4hfmt86pbmv4gipepe2d5 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6528920,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cje/bex056,,10.1093/cje/bex056,3125364330,,0,002-856-834-652-090; 003-348-741-765-69X; 004-046-716-332-895; 004-871-543-401-169; 007-336-870-969-813; 008-475-792-503-861; 014-373-309-507-628; 019-268-391-236-456; 022-217-531-534-702; 022-472-873-299-392; 024-351-190-580-451; 024-828-296-919-906; 025-821-732-006-228; 027-440-628-511-420; 027-455-184-951-485; 028-809-688-907-391; 029-652-108-487-444; 031-012-949-387-030; 035-881-168-146-12X; 040-531-566-689-139; 045-777-161-498-037; 049-854-002-812-457; 052-723-818-069-06X; 053-194-698-585-347; 056-101-149-468-029; 057-032-851-470-794; 058-412-058-866-559; 058-879-947-933-394; 061-873-175-167-992; 062-419-980-714-916; 065-327-126-170-308; 067-430-579-791-957; 069-078-077-310-036; 071-695-089-697-915; 074-000-738-244-955; 077-436-811-650-375; 077-880-737-976-959; 078-263-790-045-371; 079-867-019-052-934; 082-171-445-174-478; 087-053-648-444-575; 088-993-997-046-627; 090-436-724-624-372; 091-486-492-861-425; 092-345-458-821-750; 093-779-978-973-429; 095-037-640-171-955; 098-841-652-020-288; 101-214-978-945-09X; 101-526-808-390-08X; 105-656-624-695-293; 109-306-141-218-252; 112-117-632-281-526; 112-806-447-112-193; 115-912-228-451-249; 119-362-584-997-151; 123-314-615-927-745; 124-132-600-843-548; 124-465-896-432-486; 134-630-711-831-253; 137-236-023-469-311; 139-323-005-682-790; 142-084-600-389-807; 142-124-192-930-847; 147-432-235-680-435; 152-501-222-860-434; 164-394-966-792-440; 174-619-377-275-100; 180-429-125-381-046; 182-401-964-998-619; 183-376-861-980-736; 184-761-387-443-50X; 192-258-159-325-001; 197-129-658-402-674,12,True,,green,lens

Kämmerer; M. O. Klein; Maximilian Moergel; M. Gemmel; G. F. Draenert,"Introduction: After ablative surgery of the mandible, angular stable alloplastic reconstruction plates are commonly employed. The aim of the study was a long-term evaluation of local anatomical, as looking at systemic factors influencing specific complications and the failure rate of such plates. Materials and methods: In a retrospective study covering an 11-year period, we reviewed the outcomes of angular stable plates of patients who had a segmental resection of the mandible and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction. Complications and failure rates were assessed and local (anatomical size and localization of resection) as well as systemic risk factors (age, sex, radiation therapy, smoking) evaluated. Results: Altogether, 162 plates were reviewed. The overall complication rate was 28% (fractures n ¼ 8, loose screws n ¼ 7, dehiscences n ¼ 31) after an average time of 13 months. Cumulative survival rates of 73% after one, of 67% after 2, of 59% after 3 and of 40% after five years were observed. We found a significant correlation of increasing defect sizes to a rising complication and failure rate. Plate dehiscence occurred more often in defects including the midline (p ¼ 0.005). Though not statistically significant, the occurrence of plate fracture was associated with lateral mandibular defects (7/8, p ¼ 0.113). In smoking patients an earlier failure rate was seen. Conclusion: The results clearly indicate that the success of alloplastic reconstruction plates of the mandible is dependent on various risk factors. They should e if possible e be used temporarily only. If not done primarily, a secondary approach with bone reconstruction is recommended.",42,5,e271,6,Dehiscence; Surgery; Retrospective cohort study; Segmental resection; Mandible; Cumulative survival; Risk factor; Radiation therapy; Medicine; Complication,Angular stable; Complications; Localization; Reconstruction mandible; Reconstruction plate; Risk factor; Smoking; Success,"Age Factors; Aged; Biocompatible Materials/chemistry; Bone Plates/adverse effects; Bone Screws/adverse effects; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/radiotherapy; Cohort Studies; Device Removal; Equipment Failure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mandibular Neoplasms/radiotherapy; Mandibular Reconstruction/instrumentation; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy Dosage; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Smoking; Surgical Wound Dehiscence/etiology; Survival Analysis; Titanium/chemistry; Treatment Outcome",Biocompatible Materials; Titanium,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010518213002898 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1010518213002898,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcms.2013.10.004,24296118,10.1016/j.jcms.2013.10.004,2052424523,,0,001-041-273-395-042; 003-424-735-139-07X; 008-680-926-965-010; 010-660-363-124-376; 011-020-052-009-97X; 016-471-458-233-247; 016-587-317-992-658; 018-747-056-984-475; 025-156-399-935-412; 025-303-007-639-241; 030-424-815-476-18X; 034-368-719-952-985; 036-710-053-857-466; 039-406-276-516-75X; 039-490-989-175-021; 042-505-874-393-827; 043-199-789-911-638; 049-425-444-325-888; 049-448-822-283-091; 051-038-970-519-860; 054-379-420-523-114; 057-705-158-090-818; 059-776-646-983-587; 064-316-531-888-989; 066-353-718-184-979; 070-323-330-069-074; 074-139-461-301-190; 075-709-545-390-299; 086-630-067-345-49X; 101-536-274-218-099; 104-601-712-865-171; 114-496-367-510-783; 124-186-487-769-035; 126-758-786-518-272; 126-856-817-448-545; 132-858-996-694-448; 135-743-191-481-786; 146-932-551-241-13X,30,False,,,lens

050-323-875-058-29X,The Extraterritorial Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act Protects U.S. Taxpayers from Worldwide Bailouts,2012-03-27,2012.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Michael Greenberger,"The significant extraterritorial scope of the derivatives regulation within the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act promises to foster rigorous international standards for financial regulation that will restore transparency and stability to the global derivatives market. At present, that market exceeds $700 trillion notional value, or over ten times the world GDP. Despite opposition from Wall Street to the present extraterritorial application of almost all of Dodd-Frank’s derivatives regulation, the plain language of the statute requires implementing that regulation on an appropriate extraterritorial basis in order to protect U.S. taxpayers from bailing out financial institutions engaging in foreign derivatives trading, as was required of those taxpayers after the subprime credit meltdown of 2008. The unregulated nature of the global derivatives market exposes the world to continued systemic risk, especially in a time of worry about sovereign defaults and the defaults of banks that hold or a have insured through synthetic derivatives sovereign debt. Defaults of that nature are conceded by almost everyone as having the ability to trigger undercapitalized and non-transparent credit derivatives of the kind that compounded the 2008 subprime fiasco and that led to the U.S. taxpayers’ near-$13 trillion bailout of the financial industry. With worldwide economic stability at stake, tough, but appropriate, extraterritorial regulatory protections for the derivatives markets are needed instantaneously. This article shows that the extraterritorial reach of Dodd-Frank derivatives rules on capitalization, collateralization, and transparency will restore stability and integrity to the global derivatives market. To this end, the article is divided into five parts. First, the article demonstrates how Dodd-Frank aims to regulate derivatives trading so as to avoid, inter alia, the kind of systemic risk that presented itself in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown. Second, it establishes that Congress, pursuant to its constitutional authority, intended U.S. financial reforms to apply on extraterritorial basis so long as the United States has a vested relationship to the derivatives transactions in question. Third, the article discusses the current controversy caused by worldwide “Too Big to Fail” banks and the European Union surrounding the extraterritorial scope of Dodd-Frank-mandated reforms. Fourth, the article defends the extraterritorial application of Dodd-Frank regulations when a derivatives trade either involves a U.S. party or has the potential to substantially threaten the U.S. economy: it demonstrates that Congress has the constitutional authority to direct the extraterritorial application of U.S. derivatives regulations and that such an application aligns with U.S. regulators’ standard enforcement practices. Fifth, the article shows that the extraterritorial scope of Dodd-Frank regulation is necessary to protect U.S. taxpayers from the risks posed by the global derivatives market as it affects U.S. interests and that that scope will benefit U.S. banks and the U.S. economy by establishing a more stable derivatives market. For that matter, the extraterritorial application of Dodd-Frank derivatives standards will protect foreign taxpayers from further bailouts of defaulting and the world economy from systemically risky banking institutions.",,,,,Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Credit crunch; International economics; Law and economics; Bailout; Too big to fail; European union; Financial regulation; Derivatives market,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=2029063 https://www.michaelgreenberger.com/files/Greenberger_UMKC_Final.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2029063 https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2183&context=fac_pubs https://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/1184/ https://works.bepress.com/michael_greenberger/47/,https://www.michaelgreenberger.com/files/Greenberger_UMKC_Final.pdf,,,1943728358,,0,,1,False,,,lens

If the smoothing causes more information to be reflected in the stock price, it is likely to improve the allocation of resources and can be a critical factor in investment decisions. This study aims to build metrics to determine the degree of smoothing in Brazilian public companies, to classify them as smoothing and non-smoothing companies and additionally to present evidence on the long-term relationship between the smoothing hypothesis and stock return and risk. Using the Economatica and CVM databases, this study focuses on 145 companies in the period 1998-2007. We find that Brazilian smoothers have a smaller degree of systemic risk than non-smoothers. In average terms, the beta of smoothers is significantly lower than non-smoothers. Regarding return, we find that the abnormal annualized returns of smoothers are significantly higher. We confirm differences in the groups by nonparametric and parametric tests in cross section or as time series, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference in performance in the Brazilian market between firms that do and do not engage in smoothing.",8,1,1,20,Nonparametric statistics; Statistics; Parametric statistics; Normalization (statistics); Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Abnormal return; Investment decisions; Smoothing; Stock (geology),,,,,https://biblat.unam.mx/revista/bar-brazilian-administration-review/articulo/the-smoothing-hypothesis-stock-returns-and-risk-in-brazil http://www.fucape.br/_public/producao_cientifica/2/BAR%20-%20LOPO.pdf https://www.scielo.br/pdf/bar/v8n1/v8n1a02.pdf https://www.scielo.br/j/bar/a/sZj9NgDDRVTq5ThLv3dKqwh/ https://repositorio.ufba.br/ri/bitstream/ri/6941/1/Martinez%2c%20Antonio%20Lopo.pdf http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bar/v8n1/v8n1a02.pdf https://doaj.org/article/6ca1152853904a4ebba4ccc468b09eda http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/841/84117299002.pdf https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S1807-76922011000100002&lng=en http://www.anpad.org.br/periodicos/arq_pdf/a_1141.pdf https://repositorio.ufba.br/ri/handle/ri/6941,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s1807-76922011000100002,,10.1590/s1807-76922011000100002,2138926105,,0,004-421-423-088-560; 006-895-818-187-026; 009-443-551-689-626; 020-502-962-432-484; 027-623-644-176-687; 031-525-281-255-559; 031-858-883-254-516; 033-080-943-588-429; 038-648-434-244-098; 043-154-752-981-166; 059-180-615-900-411; 062-131-201-589-894; 062-296-456-489-84X; 072-312-389-580-415; 076-954-356-712-012; 077-370-903-550-41X; 086-214-124-418-85X; 087-408-884-039-600; 094-234-605-113-457; 112-597-883-734-185; 113-576-139-547-537; 124-357-432-740-175; 124-573-603-005-172; 137-496-516-373-378; 150-164-641-072-486; 153-874-361-178-636; 161-509-967-390-302,18,True,cc-by,gold,lens

The updating steps for this model are functions of past data and have information theoretic optimality properties. The static parameters are conveniently estimated by maximum likelihood. We establish the theoretical properties of the model and show that the maximum likelihood estimators of the static parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal. Using spatial weights based on cross-border lending data and European sovereign CDS spread data over the period 2009–2014, we find evidence of contagion in terms of high, time-varying spatial spillovers in the perceived credit riskiness of European sovereigns during the sovereign debt crisis.

Wolff,"The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the proposed prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances regulation (EIP) are designed to avoid imbalances. However, these instruments overlap, and need clarification.Both the ESRB and the Commission, which is given certain powers by the EIP, must identify and act early on risks. Acting in the face of strong economic and political pressure is difficult. Complementing the current approach with transparent and rules-based mechanisms will reduce this problem.The EIP and ESRB can complement each other in terms of analysis and policy, and close collaboration will be vital. The EIP regulation can be used to ensure that ESRB recommendations are followed up. In the area of financial recommendations relevent to macroeconomic imbalances, the Commission should have a more formal requirement to act on ESRB recommendations. The EIP regulation would benefit from a clause allowing recommendations to be addressed not only to member states.Conflicts between the ESRB and Commission could arise. In this case, the Treaty requires the Commission to issue a recommendation even if the ESRB issues a negative finding.Legally, it might not be possible to exclude the use by the Commission of confidential information obtained in the ESRB.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Commission; Treaty; Confidentiality,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bre:polcon:555,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bre:polcon:555,,,3121285743,,0,,0,False,,,lens

In the present paper, we prove a dual representation of a particular subclass of such systemic risk measures and the existence and uniqueness of the optimal allocation related to them. We also introduce an associated utility maximisation problem which has the same solution as the minimisation problem associated to the systemic risk measure. In addition, the optimiser in the dual formulation provides a risk allocation which is fair from the point of view of the individual financial institutions.

Preoperative systemic evaluation is important for the adequate selection of the patients and the operations. Dipyridamole-thallium scintigraphy is more useful than exercise stress testing to assess cardiac risks of patients with peripheral arterial diseases. Anatomical bypass is the standard operation resulting in favorable patency. Despite of relatively inferior long term patency, extra-anatomical bypass operations are useful alternatives for the patients having high systemic risks or severe sclerosis of aorto-iliac arteries.

Methods Clinical data from 31 patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy(NAION) were retrospectively analyzed,and then treated with thrombolysin pills and composite anisodine. Results After the combined therapy,18/38 eye-sights improved,the dark area in visual field became thin or contracted,the effective rate was 47.4%;and 16 eyes(42.1%) had no obvious improvement,4 eyes(10.5%) worsened. Conclusion Medical therapy improves the retina circulation effectively,thus increases visual acuity.Patients with hypertension associated with NAION usually receive antihypertensive medications,however,if the patients' receive active antihypertensive remedy their BP should be monitored.In treatment of patients with NATION,the relevant systemic risk factors should be concerned.",13,2,409,410,Surgery; Visual field; Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Optic neuropathy; Anisodine; Retina circulation; Thrombolysin; Combined therapy; Disease entity; Medicine,,,,,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SYYY200602092.htm,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SYYY200602092.htm,,,2385201239,,0,,0,False,,,lens

By holding correlated asset portfolios and serving as counterparties to similarly situated financial institutions, managers can strategically increase the likelihood of a government bailout rather than receivership under the OLA. Three case studies — Lehman Brothers, AIG, and large European banks’ response to the 2011 bail-in proposals — demonstrate the implications of the OLA’s shortcomings and the inadequacy of the FDIC’s approach. In light of these strategic incentives, the FDIC should modify its intervention policy to respond effectively to illiquidity-driven systemic risk and prudential regulators should work to reduce the likelihood of correlated balance-sheet insolvency.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Government; Asset (economics); Bailout; Incentive; Receivership; Insolvency; Intervention (law),,,,,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2220208 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2220208 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=2220208,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2220208,,10.2139/ssrn.2220208,2111395093,,0,016-781-674-597-41X; 019-263-527-772-627; 020-699-158-967-631; 021-106-304-154-736; 023-956-829-221-78X; 060-139-753-037-40X; 075-546-511-344-784; 081-107-396-729-365; 090-514-247-986-207; 123-894-688-096-544; 127-225-432-591-426; 167-938-639-547-300; 175-403-034-510-491,0,True,,green,lens

Few data exist concerning the natural history of degenerative spinal osteoarthritis (OA) and its associated risk factors. The aim of this Greek case-control study is to examine risk factors that have been previously shown or hypothesized to be correlated to spinal intravertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Study Design. From May 2009 to December 2012, 818 matched pairs (cases and controls) were recruited and participated in the case-control study. All clinical data were collected through a detailed interview and meticulous clinical and radiological evaluation.  The severity of disease was determined by radiological Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) grades and Lanes scores. Results. Female gender (p=0.001), old age, BMI (p=0.06), heavy bodily fatigue (p=0.031), lower educational level (p=0.019) and osteopenia or osteoporosis (p=0.005 and p=0.0005, respectively) were significantly associated to increased risk of spinal intravertebral disc degeneration. In the female subgroup population, menopause was a significant risk factor (p=0.012) · breast feeding, on the contrary, was protective and associated to a decreased probability of IDD (p=0.013). No significant difference was found between the two groups as far as smoking status was concerned. Conclusions. Systemic risk factors play a role in the aetiology of spinal IDD in Greece.

We find, first, that an economically sizable number of firms are predicted to fail when their customers default on their trade debt. Second, these prospective defaulters are indeed more likely to go bankrupt than other firms. Third, a certain type of firm-bank relationships, in which a bank extends loans to many of the firms in the same supply chain, significantly reduces firms' bankruptcy probability, providing evidence for the existence and relevance of ”deep pockets” as documented in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997).",,,,,Supply chain; Debt; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Trade credit; Bankruptcy; Monetary economics; Default; Database transaction,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hit/cinwps/20.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hit:cinwps:20,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hit/cinwps/20.html,,,3124943527,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Ltd,India,M Rema; R Pradeepa,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be defined as damage to microvascular system in the retina due to prolonged hyperglycaemia. The prevalence of DR in the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology (CURES) Eye Study in south India was 17.6 per cent, significantly lower than age-matched western counterparts. However, due to the large number of diabetic subjects, DR is likely to pose a public health burden in India. CURES Eye study showed that the major systemic risk factors for onset and progression of DR are duration of diabetes, degree of glycaemic control and hyperlipidaemia. Hypertension did not play a major role in this cross-sectional analysis. The role of oxidative stress, atherosclerotic end points and genetic factors in susceptibility to DR has been studied. It was found that DR was associated with increased intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness in type 2 Indian diabetic subjects suggesting that common pathogenic mechanisms might predispose to diabetic microangiopathy. Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric, has been shown to inhibit proliferation of retinal endothelial cells in vivo. Visual disability from DR is largely preventable if managed with timely intervention by laser. It has been clearly demonstrated that in type 2 south Indian diabetic patients with proliferative DR who underwent Pan retinal photocoagulation, 73 per cent eyes with good visual acuity (6/9) at baseline maintained the same vision at 1 yr follow up. There is evidence that DR begins to develop years before the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Our earlier study demonstrated that DR is present in 7 per cent of newly diagnosed subjects, hence routine retinal screening for DR even at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes may help in optimized laser therapy. Annual retinal examination and early detection of DR can considerably reduce the risk of visual loss in diabetic individuals.",125,3,297,310,Epidemiology; Internal medicine; Surgery; Arterial stiffness; Retina; Type 2 diabetes; Diabetic retinopathy; Retinal; Retinal Examination; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,,Angiogenesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Anticoagulants/therapeutic use; Diabetic Retinopathy/classification; Humans; India/epidemiology; Prevalence; Rural Population; Urban Population,Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Anticoagulants,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17496357 http://repository.ias.ac.in/92714/1/18-p.pdf http://repository.ias.ac.in/92714/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17496357/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17496357 http://www.mdrf-eprints.in/487/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17496357,17496357,,2216600199,,0,000-786-270-273-269; 001-589-929-360-082; 003-372-417-622-961; 004-810-648-149-001; 004-843-708-049-733; 006-407-601-965-194; 006-897-970-344-486; 007-111-346-176-609; 008-029-136-124-740; 009-385-332-445-629; 009-698-037-950-881; 011-911-661-449-97X; 014-014-516-930-344; 014-652-163-774-222; 014-767-594-526-896; 015-442-266-186-598; 016-823-293-318-598; 017-867-125-859-53X; 018-207-360-004-323; 018-531-088-436-315; 019-571-998-350-804; 020-197-661-479-731; 020-763-482-956-997; 021-648-970-707-992; 022-721-941-923-033; 023-246-511-558-191; 027-488-610-166-131; 027-639-759-700-000; 027-784-510-335-512; 031-050-595-342-114; 031-699-766-443-582; 033-218-709-996-757; 033-548-811-343-105; 033-743-674-858-914; 034-582-542-308-306; 036-211-679-151-741; 036-840-610-955-671; 037-286-125-350-389; 038-761-457-402-25X; 038-828-419-997-567; 040-296-660-962-552; 041-930-479-479-12X; 041-953-150-459-387; 042-049-843-836-182; 044-528-443-107-15X; 044-627-411-474-637; 046-460-606-786-930; 046-619-934-866-026; 050-033-697-661-196; 050-767-850-101-332; 054-624-271-997-872; 057-543-826-934-352; 058-157-986-374-316; 064-967-463-187-150; 067-220-724-011-860; 070-731-693-874-18X; 070-990-588-858-942; 071-971-737-044-452; 074-108-624-164-476; 074-894-925-359-913; 076-701-362-018-275; 077-093-979-317-080; 077-256-707-263-385; 077-445-872-637-179; 084-202-731-118-292; 086-710-771-926-765; 087-972-431-446-18X; 088-434-048-853-602; 088-785-174-877-677; 088-879-425-093-947; 089-077-889-910-150; 091-449-408-880-269; 093-371-505-956-806; 096-835-108-610-328; 097-064-533-297-057; 097-456-510-919-194; 103-996-036-206-164; 111-126-218-109-753; 111-931-683-638-193; 117-074-074-438-852; 119-039-220-464-442; 122-195-129-622-908; 129-076-988-758-507; 130-510-223-696-943; 154-074-007-186-079; 155-540-548-940-937; 156-302-052-497-612,101,True,cc-by-nc-sa,gold,lens

On the one hand, banks can focus on relationship banking and use IT developments to tailor services to individual needs and build enhanced, albeit modified, relationships with customers. On the other hand, IT better allows banks to exploit economies of scale and scope, which are most evident in transaction banking. Another manifestation of IT is via financial innovations that have enhanced marketability. Stability enters the picture because increased marketability facilitates opportunistic behavior. Together with enhanced herding behavior and changes in industry structure, this could undermine stability and augment systemic risk, calling for a regulatory overhaul.",13,1,71,101,Herd behavior; Information technology; Business; Systemic risk; Exploit; Transaction banking; Scope (project management); Economies of scale; Banking industry; Industrial organization,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ecr/ecr13.html#Marinc13 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ecr/ecr13.html#Marinc13 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2,,10.1007/s10660-013-9107-2,3124702848,,0,000-706-808-017-644; 001-191-217-369-919; 001-478-152-342-077; 001-560-200-899-623; 002-781-777-229-208; 003-215-537-005-977; 003-726-347-619-876; 004-391-489-299-809; 004-906-758-359-321; 005-435-161-166-699; 005-781-807-178-894; 007-236-021-000-209; 007-381-251-642-021; 008-124-035-948-156; 008-525-841-275-555; 008-595-361-622-566; 008-920-726-793-576; 009-571-685-201-055; 009-910-944-903-873; 010-466-809-502-679; 011-161-318-905-202; 011-234-338-707-857; 011-353-852-328-093; 011-631-329-145-513; 013-936-071-542-940; 014-376-299-796-844; 014-485-574-524-740; 015-096-860-138-207; 016-665-645-839-960; 017-421-298-700-053; 017-515-828-465-108; 018-026-997-291-355; 018-536-276-834-233; 019-391-014-511-129; 019-614-665-812-932; 019-633-924-665-943; 019-953-700-440-481; 020-124-057-228-111; 020-182-167-086-121; 020-990-645-625-878; 021-306-996-051-004; 024-482-778-909-000; 024-494-295-434-619; 025-160-687-617-39X; 025-362-615-805-805; 026-532-478-065-665; 027-362-326-970-719; 027-562-122-905-313; 028-000-366-124-291; 028-903-717-747-317; 029-138-308-138-335; 029-306-405-232-155; 029-372-900-914-044; 029-395-557-156-056; 029-544-734-693-028; 029-913-695-521-602; 031-561-196-017-677; 031-828-420-421-528; 032-232-391-556-456; 033-921-935-660-738; 035-718-145-406-013; 036-226-683-916-526; 038-895-371-635-486; 044-109-138-781-360; 044-430-557-846-887; 045-332-508-118-434; 045-896-897-409-027; 046-174-955-383-323; 048-661-021-317-067; 049-784-348-657-211; 050-047-250-569-032; 050-839-733-471-246; 051-186-069-887-825; 051-978-815-906-473; 052-108-675-921-299; 052-220-205-912-70X; 053-234-804-139-169; 053-272-119-557-212; 053-320-903-169-487; 053-614-993-641-557; 053-924-083-828-738; 054-018-334-674-078; 055-003-447-740-494; 055-481-277-101-02X; 057-347-289-064-479; 057-359-227-835-248; 058-273-019-371-687; 059-846-197-506-654; 060-597-064-924-757; 061-325-016-313-756; 062-407-772-309-774; 062-771-129-930-394; 063-089-905-896-18X; 063-192-617-246-460; 063-701-014-067-511; 065-758-025-923-061; 067-960-971-788-099; 069-207-622-654-60X; 069-315-814-317-024; 069-363-640-667-185; 070-211-403-219-656; 070-428-903-109-311; 070-842-873-083-037; 071-302-697-813-238; 072-207-206-940-429; 074-499-657-711-078; 074-563-493-063-038; 076-134-343-470-401; 076-258-612-144-263; 076-715-267-803-125; 078-375-739-801-430; 078-395-124-175-822; 078-669-273-091-302; 080-081-498-407-800; 080-259-816-108-562; 080-337-384-382-20X; 081-835-976-881-174; 082-853-435-699-922; 083-553-243-892-412; 084-299-675-912-267; 084-792-787-086-210; 086-317-786-026-830; 086-374-354-293-020; 086-388-438-452-532; 086-436-650-200-117; 087-941-756-937-794; 088-030-117-331-373; 088-877-936-593-450; 089-774-286-195-681; 090-272-877-010-509; 090-798-983-044-274; 092-118-638-071-301; 093-919-961-587-355; 097-748-420-984-579; 098-918-348-740-267; 099-701-255-450-120; 101-163-546-649-206; 103-787-315-127-054; 106-210-356-015-588; 107-575-414-030-873; 108-548-801-154-158; 109-786-123-073-403; 110-511-072-069-123; 110-652-121-561-640; 111-474-674-516-089; 114-594-377-031-021; 115-057-077-029-643; 115-081-336-671-463; 121-898-974-717-896; 125-743-770-395-361; 128-196-187-693-117; 130-708-451-260-205; 131-874-794-713-990; 131-896-844-864-445; 132-760-208-192-784; 132-934-711-768-629; 133-250-460-564-240; 134-124-593-035-261; 136-106-944-186-234; 138-155-635-189-478; 140-512-558-906-684; 140-770-774-883-423; 142-084-600-389-807; 142-787-047-914-450; 143-880-759-396-041; 144-856-747-815-743; 144-867-349-933-449; 145-825-497-947-552; 146-446-624-313-533; 148-238-842-414-064; 148-919-002-693-631; 152-589-019-580-831; 155-227-346-684-225; 156-661-962-199-889; 157-503-224-896-618; 159-996-843-089-349; 160-564-764-251-973; 162-050-457-209-42X; 162-574-139-860-644; 163-424-386-466-225; 164-768-047-850-877; 167-015-023-893-023; 167-308-406-092-02X; 168-237-001-729-927; 169-700-057-757-175; 173-801-184-677-909; 177-457-228-985-133; 182-268-121-212-219; 183-667-390-718-183; 185-234-200-994-910; 188-086-278-221-990; 188-223-060-398-468; 194-906-485-892-314,49,False,,,lens

033-946-579-746-324,"An multi-agent model of RMBS, credit risk transfer in banks and financial stability: implications of the subprime crisis",,2013.0,,,,,,Bewaji Oluwasegun; Sheri M Markose,"In this paper, we apply the agent-based modelling (ABM) simulation technique for the study of RMBS within banking and the implications for financial stability from the process of credit risk transfer. We design and develop a two-sector computational agent model using an insolvency risk constrained multi-period horizon model of profit maximisation with mortgage origination and securitization by banks on the one hand and the asset liability management activities of institutional investors who seek returns from equity and credit assets. The RMBS model for banks includes regulatory arbitrage from Basel capital adequacy, asset quality deterioration and default risk of loans. Our approach shows how the RMBS activity and the credit risk involved is incorporated into the portfolios of institutional investors and hedge funds who sought high return from the high risk tranche of credit assets. On this basis, we discuss the financial stability implications arising from the calibrations of two sectors where banking data relies on the FDIC data set and the default and coupon rates for credit assets come from the 2007 Citibank Report. Critical to issues such as whether there is an over supply of RMBS with an excessive high proportion of assets being securitized (typical rates of about 40%-49% being the case in the 2001-2002 for subprime originators) is found to lie in inappropriate coupon rates being paid on credit products based on high default RMBS and hence the costs of RMBS were not correctly factored. The implications of the passage of time for insolvencies to kick in can be observed in the agent based model. For instance, institutional investors with large portfolios of up to 38% or more of credit assets with default rates in excess of 10% could be insolvent by year 2.

An unintended consequence of deposit insurance is the reduction in the incentive of depositors to monitor banks, which leads to excessive risk-taking. This paper examines the relation between deposit insurance and bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading to and during the recent financial crisis. It finds that generous financial safety nets increase bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. However, during the crisis, bank risk is lower and systemic stability is greater in countries with deposit insurance coverage. The findings suggest that the""moral hazard effect""of deposit insurance dominates in good times while the""stabilization effect""of deposit insurance dominates in turbulent times. Nevertheless, the overall effect of deposit insurance over the full sample remains negative since the destabilizing effect during normal times is greater in magnitude compared with the stabilizing effect during global turbulence. In addition, the analysis finds that good bank supervision can alleviate the unintended consequences of deposit insurance on bank systemic risk during good times, suggesting that fostering the appropriate incentive framework is very important for ensuring systemic stability.",,,,,Emerging markets; Business; Systemic risk; Unintended consequences; Deposit insurance; Safety net; Financial crisis; Moral hazard; Incentive; Monetary economics,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:6289 https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/6289.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:6289,,,3124574453,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Hurd,"Banking system crises are complex events that in a short span of time can inflict extensive damage to banks themselves and to the external economy. The crisis liter- ature has so far identified a number of distinct effects or channels that can propagate distress contagiously both directly within the banking network itself and indirectly, between the network and the external economy. These contagious effects, and the potential events that trigger these effects, can explain most aspects of past crises, and are thought to be likely to dominate future financial crises. Since the current international financial regulatory regime based on the Basel III Accord does a good job of ensuring that banks are resilient to such contagion effects taken one at a time, systemic risk theorists increasingly understand that future crises are likely to be dom- inated by the spillovers between distinct contagion channels. The present paper aims to provide a model for systemic risk that is comprehensive enough to include the important contagion channels identified in the literature. In such a model one can hope to understand the dangerous spillover effects that are expected to dominate future crises. To rein in the number and complexity of the modelling assumptions, two requirements are imposed, neither of which is yet well-known or established in the main stream of systemic risk research. The first, called stock-flow consistency, demands that the financial system follows a rigorous set of rules based on account- ing principles. The second requirement, called Asset-Liability symmetry, implies that every proposed contagion channel has a dual channel obtained by interchanging as- sets and liabilities, and that these dual channel pairs have a symmetric mathematical representation.",,,,,Systemic risk; Dual (category theory); Communication channel; Economics; Set (psychology); Funding liquidity; Basel III; Insolvency; Spillover effect; Monetary economics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3081147 http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05289,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3081147,,10.2139/ssrn.3081147,2953217785,,0,000-741-809-866-182; 003-758-832-327-304; 003-803-424-332-155; 006-381-442-206-445; 012-430-523-378-543; 019-899-490-438-505; 022-609-226-545-432; 023-920-010-872-504; 024-351-190-580-451; 025-915-350-487-916; 032-621-982-512-358; 035-104-934-704-682; 035-571-732-473-946; 055-152-571-477-725; 058-879-947-933-394; 062-665-995-202-765; 068-847-264-689-149; 071-556-858-718-339; 076-088-192-927-763; 076-932-627-503-398; 088-149-451-347-256; 089-205-015-714-89X; 101-731-103-558-535; 107-320-922-263-505; 109-179-346-441-125; 109-381-535-599-334; 141-856-251-947-735; 145-892-596-566-894; 169-886-646-257-206,0,True,,green,lens
095-803-792-557-232,"Global Banks, Local Crises: Bad News from Argentina",,2002.0,,Econometric Reviews,,,,Marco Del Negro; Stephen J. Kay,"Banking crises have been a recurrent phenomenon in Latin America over the past few decades. Some have argued that the internationalization of the banking sector has ushered in a new era: what used to be systemic risk from the perspective of local banks with undiversified portfolios might no longer be systemic from the standpoint of large international banks. ; Argentina's experience shows that the presence of international banks was not enough to prevent local banking crises and sizable losses to depositors. The ""bad news"" from Argentina, this article argues, is that depositors in emerging markets may not reap the full benefits of international portfolio diversification because international banks have limited liability, at least under some circumstances-for instance, when the local government heavily intervenes in the banking system. The authors emphasize that while the limited-liability feature of international banks may seem bad ex post-and, of course, it is from the perspective of Argentine depositors-this feature may well be desirable, perhaps even necessary, ex ante. ; The article first presents evidence of the globalization of the banking sector in Latin America and the dramatic increase of the phenomenon in the late nineties. After reviewing the literature on the pros and cons of international banks in emerging markets, the authors focus on the legal issues behind the limited-liability feature. The authors examine the new evidence that Argentina's recent experiences provide and conclude by analyzing the pros and cons of the limited-liability feature.",87,,89,106,Emerging markets; Ex-ante; Limited liability; Systemic risk; Retail banking; Latin Americans; Economics; International economics; Globalization; Financial system; Internationalization,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedaer/y2002iq3p89-106nv.87no.3.html https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/economists/delnegro/delnegro_kay03.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/article/fipfedaer/y_3a2002_3ai_3aq3_3ap_3a89-106_3an_3av.87no.3.htm,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedaer/y2002iq3p89-106nv.87no.3.html,,,2126150431,,0,001-062-648-461-791; 002-720-463-035-436; 003-408-059-251-276; 003-566-412-749-993; 006-526-265-679-800; 011-712-172-327-38X; 017-176-278-786-279; 019-249-151-047-898; 025-222-665-801-250; 036-271-654-248-744; 037-978-162-999-475; 039-229-875-044-411; 047-188-850-601-535; 049-881-670-185-106; 062-934-028-707-074; 064-880-922-151-56X; 067-690-495-747-992; 069-702-321-840-597; 086-892-819-129-483; 094-444-482-865-637; 097-841-462-544-957; 099-846-019-416-550; 102-372-506-566-518; 110-204-191-215-912; 116-877-899-503-279; 150-302-787-224-238; 153-574-452-115-011; 181-971-946-226-349; 190-297-947-197-88X; 199-279-794-929-16X,16,False,,,lens

A Component Expected Shortfall Approach to Systemic Risk,,2015.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Georgiana-Denisa Banulescu; Elena Ivona Dumitrescu,"This paper proposes a component approach to systemic risk which allows to decompose the risk of the aggregate financial system (measured by Expected Shortfall) while accounting for the firm characteristics. Developed by analogy with the Component Value-at-Risk concept, our new systemic risk measure, called Component ES, presents several advantages. It is a hybrid measure, which combines the Too Interconnected To Fail and the Too Big To Fail logics. CES relies only on publicly available daily data and encompasses the popular Marginal ES measure. CES can be used to assess the contribution of a firm to systemic risk at a precise date but also to forecast its contribution over a certain period. The empirical application verifies the ability of CES to identify the most systemically risky firms during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. We show that our measure identifies the institutions labeled as SIFIs by the Financial Stability Board.

The book provides an in-depth analysis of China’s contemporary financial regulatory system, focusing on risks, regulation, and policies in practice. By drawing on public and private interest theories relating to financial regulation, the book contends that the controlled development of the banking sector, and the financial sector generally, has transformed China’s banks into more market-oriented institutions and increased public sector growth. However, China’s financial market and financial regulation have some inherent weaknesses and deficiencies. This book also offers insights into how this can be improved or adapted to minimize systemic risks in China’s financial sector. This book tries to prove that financial regulation is not just a vehicle for maintaining efficient financial markets but a primary tool through which the Chinese government achieves its political and economic objectives. More fundamentally, according to the law and finance theory, strong market and vibrant judicial systems are needed to further modernize China’s financial markets and market economy.; The book will be a useful reference for anyone interested in learning from the Chinese experience.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Public sector; Government; China; Financial market; Financial crisis; Market economy; Financial regulation; Politics,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/Conceptualizing-Regulatory-Thicket-Financial-Routledge/dp/0367410532 https://www.bookdepository.com/Conceptualizing-Regulatory-Thicket-Shen-Wei/9780367410537 https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780367814458/conceptualizing-regulatory-thicket-shen-wei https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780367814458 https://openlibrary.org/books/OL29518995M/Conceptualizing_the_Regulatory_Thicket,https://www.amazon.com/Conceptualizing-Regulatory-Thicket-Financial-Routledge/dp/0367410532,,,3082672427,,0,,1,False,,,lens

Methods We reviewed patient demographics, ocular findings, and clinical courses for 25 patients receiving systemic anticoagulation with warfarin who subsequently underwent vitreoretinal surgery. Results Patient ages ranged from 49 years to 81 years (median, 69 years). Indications for anticoagulation included atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, deep vein thrombosis, prosthetic heart valves, and hypercoagulable state. Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 36 months (median, 19.5 months). The international normalized ratio ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 (median, 2.0). Final vision after surgery ranged from 20/20 to 20/400 (median, 20/100). One patient who underwent scleral buckling and external drainage of subretinal fluid had an intraoperative subretinal hemorrhage associated with the drainage procedure. In all other patients, no intraoperative complications occurred. Conclusion Cessation of therapy with warfarin may not be necessary in patients receiving anticoagulation who are undergoing vitreoretinal procedures. Successful visual and anatomical results may be achieved after vitreoretinal surgery for patients receiving anticoagulation with warfarin.

Gabriel,"The global financial crisis affected microfinance institutions (MFIs) as lending growth was constrained by scarcer borrowing opportunities, while the economic slowdown negatively impacted asset quality and profitability. It also brought to the fore the relatively high interest rates that MFIs charge to their (low-income) customers. This paper revisits the issue of systemic risk of MFIs, and finds that contrary to the evidence before the crisis, MFI performance is correlated not only to domestic economic conditions but also to changes in international capital markets. It also presents an empirical analysis of lending rates with the purpose of informing policy decisions, and finds that loan sizes, productivity, and MFI age contribute to explain differences in lending rate levels. This suggest that regulation (and policies) promoting MFI competition, and innovation in lending technologies have a better chance to result in decreased lending rates.",,,,,Economic policy; Profitability index; Business; Systemic risk; Productivity; Loan; Financial crisis; Asset quality; Competition (economics); Microfinance; Financial system,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1899576,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1899576,,,1581150803,,0,014-792-388-583-421; 021-429-680-301-409; 027-088-576-382-080; 040-367-968-971-485; 057-750-471-302-55X; 111-300-557-540-709; 141-254-345-467-371; 147-002-213-239-948; 149-744-270-653-227,25,False,,,lens

It describes the problems that may arise during the implementation of the tasks of decentralization and possible ways to solve them. As well as problems those hinder the reform of decentralization at the local government level. One of the most effective mechanisms for reforming the public administration system to ensure its efficiency and compliance with the requirements of the time is decentralization. Decentralization is the process of transferring management functions and powers of central authorities to the local level of government. A retrospective analysis of decentralization has established an unjustified delay in its onset. It explained that the actual changes towards decentralization date back to 2014, when the law enshrined the transfer of financial, logistical and other resources to the regions. Determining the prospects for decentralization in Ukraine, the expected risks that this process may cause are analyzed in this article. It is proposed to distinguish systemic risks (corruption, duplication of powers between the state public authorities and the regional public authorities, economic polarization of regions) and situational risks (social, personnel, politicization risk). The normative and legal framework, which is the foundation for the implementation of decentralization reforms in Ukraine, is characterized. Conclusions and prospects for further research are made regarding positive shifts in the course of the implementation of the reform of decentralization of power in Ukraine. The main direction of our further scientific research is the methods aimed at stimulating the efforts of local authorities to support and develop business within the community, because revenues from personal income tax are a significant part of local budgets.",,172,87,92,Economic policy; Polarization (politics); Decentralization; Business; Systemic risk; Government; Revenue; Corruption; Local government; Situational ethics,,,,,http://prostir.pdaba.dp.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/948,http://dx.doi.org/10.32782/2224-6282/172-15,,10.32782/2224-6282/172-15,3206520659,,0,,0,True,,bronze,lens

We show that techniques such as Maximum Entropy currently used to reconstruct credit networks severely underestimate the risk of contagion by assuming a trivial (fully connected) topology, a type of network structure which can be very different from the one empirically observed. We propose an efficient message-passing algorithm to explore the space of possible network structures, and show that a correct estimation of the network degree of connectedness leads to more reliable estimations for systemic risk. Such algorithm is also able to produce maximally fragile structures, providing a practical upper bound for the risk of contagion when the actual network structure is unknown. We test our algorithm on ensembles of synthetic data encoding some features of real financial networks (sparsity and heterogeneity), finding that more accurate estimations of risk can be achieved. Finally we find that this algorithm can be used to control the amount of information regulators need to require from banks in order to sufficiently constrain the reconstruction of financial networks.",,,,,Data mining; Encoding (memory); Systemic risk; Synthetic data; Economics; Market liquidity; Social connectedness; Financial networks; Upper and lower bounds; Principle of maximum entropy,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1109.6210 https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-00714026.html,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1109.6210,,,2599273898,,0,,0,False,,,lens

As the largest trade partner in the region, China has not only presented itself with opportunities for ASEAN to tap its market, but also created great challenges for the region. The fundamental question that this book addresses, therefore, is whether China’s engagement with ASEAN comes at a cost for the latter following from the systemic risks tied to the China-centric supply chains in the region. The trade interactions between China and ASEAN, though extensively explored, are less understood in the context of its influence over the region amidst the recent changing dynamics that follow from China’s global engagement and backlash from major powers. The book therefore resolutely rises against stereotypes and cliches, making readers reconsider many oversimplified assumptions of the benefits of trade engagement where economies are interconnected through complex production chains.",,,,,Supply chain; Systemic risk; International trade; Political science; Interdependence; China; Context (language use); Trade partner; Southeast asian; Shock (economics),,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:sprbok:978-981-16-1618-1 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/146813 https://eprints.utas.edu.au/37670/,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:sprbok:978-981-16-1618-1,,,3155986928,,0,,0,False,,,lens

He argues that structural vulnerabilities of this regulatory framework need to be addressed to ensure that the early-warning systems will be adequate to avoid future crises. Specifically, Schinasi points to the fact that the ESRB lacks binding powers to enforce regulation as well as the lack of a legislative framework to resolve the insolvency of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).",,,,,Public economics; Business; Systemic risk; Macroprudential regulation; Financial stability; Insolvency; Financial regulation; Financial system; Legislature,,,,,http://aei.pitt.edu/11867/,http://aei.pitt.edu/11867/,,,586454974,,0,,4,False,,,lens

Specifically our model allows for the firm-specific impact of infrequent and extreme events. When a jump occurs, its impact is in the same direction for all firms (either positive or negative), but its size and volatility are firm-specific. Based on the model we compute three measures of systemic risk: DD, NoD and ESR. Empirical results using data on the four sectors of the U.S. financial industry from 1996 to 2011 suggest that simultaneous extreme negative movements across large financial institutions are stronger in bear markets than in bull markets. Disregarding the impact of the tail dependence element implies a downward bias in the measurement of systemic risk especially during weak economic times. Two measures based on the Broker-Dealers sector (DD, NoD) and one measure (ESR) based on the Insurance sector lead the St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI).",,,,,Financial economics; Financial services; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Tail dependence; Jump; Extreme events; Financial stress; Stock (geology); Volatility (finance),,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/23279885 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2257593 https://core.ac.uk/display/23279885 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2257593_code1686273.pdf?abstractid=2257593&mirid=4 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2257593,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2257593,,10.2139/ssrn.2257593,2107879569,,0,000-846-266-307-085; 003-241-929-682-933; 006-826-830-159-520; 009-250-956-758-799; 010-119-711-999-756; 015-808-995-029-73X; 019-942-065-318-247; 021-362-483-183-884; 027-172-815-506-899; 027-575-075-514-805; 035-571-732-473-946; 041-786-210-324-199; 046-185-611-659-078; 050-514-508-839-432; 071-973-730-855-649; 072-310-100-784-291; 074-637-420-002-073; 081-740-060-661-874; 083-508-652-775-775; 092-911-684-192-298; 099-811-304-663-630; 113-341-818-322-325; 124-178-338-174-281; 136-024-583-617-879; 138-200-164-181-487; 152-541-108-203-197; 153-840-799-460-294; 162-732-720-330-488; 168-710-144-197-156,2,True,,green,lens

Wimmer; Thomas M. Randau; Max J. Friedrich; Milena M. Ploeger; Jan Schmolder; Andreas C. Strauss; Peter H. Pennekamp; Patrick Vavken; Sascha Gravius,"Prosthetic joint infections are a major challenge in total joint arthroplasty, especially in times of accumulating drug resistancies. Even though predictive risk classifications are a widely accepted tool to define a suitable treatment protocol a classification is still missing considering the difficulty in treating the -causative pathogen antibiotically. In this study, we present and evaluate a new predictive risk stratification for prosthetic joint infections in 120 cases, treated with a two-stage exchange. Treatment outcomes in 120 patients with proven prosthetic joint infections in hip and knee prostheses were regressed on time of infection, systemic risk factors, local risk factors and the difficulty in treating the causing pathogen. The main outcome variable was ""definitely free of infection"" after two years as published. Age, gender, and BMI were included as covariables and analyzed in a logistic regression model. 66 male and 54 female patients, with a mean age at surgery of 68.3 years±12.0 and a mean BMI of 26.05±6.21 were included in our survey and followed for 29.0±11.3 months. We found a significant association (p<0.001) between our score and the outcome parameters evaluated. Age, gender and BMI did not show a significant association with the outcome. These results show that our score is an independent and reliable predictor for the cure rate in prosthetic joint infections in hip and knee prostheses treated within a two-stage exchange protocol. Our score illustrates, that there is a statistically significant, sizable decrease in cure rate with an increase in score. In patients with prosthetic joint infections the validation of a risk score may help to identify patients with local and systemic risk factors or with infectious organisms identified as ""difficult to treat"" prior to the treatment or the decision about the treatment concept. Thus, appropriate extra care should be considered and provided.",82,1,143,148,Framingham Risk Score; Risk assessment; Internal medicine; Surgery; Logistic regression; Odds ratio; Arthroplasty; Comorbidity; Body mass index; Prosthesis-Related Infection; Medicine,,"Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcoholism/epidemiology; Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use; Arthroplasty, Replacement; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Body Mass Index; Comorbidity; Female; Hepatic Insufficiency/epidemiology; Hip Prosthesis; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use; Joint Prosthesis; Kidney Failure, Chronic/epidemiology; Knee Prosthesis; Logistic Models; Male; Malnutrition/epidemiology; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Postoperative Complications/epidemiology; Prognosis; Prosthesis-Related Infections/epidemiology; Renal Dialysis/statistics & numerical data; Reoperation; Respiratory Insufficiency/epidemiology; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Time Factors",Anti-Bacterial Agents; Immunosuppressive Agents,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26984667/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26984667 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26984667,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26984667,26984667,,2300502282,,0,003-254-746-520-811; 005-346-936-879-367; 014-396-739-166-749; 020-699-479-488-033; 022-314-517-585-006; 023-548-167-570-303; 028-107-211-219-608; 029-445-208-791-96X; 036-409-744-689-585; 036-883-140-823-550; 046-032-247-030-355; 048-609-469-023-536; 056-652-632-946-546; 057-217-867-250-674; 074-814-117-234-773; 076-506-400-136-501; 078-696-675-609-294; 088-179-173-964-357; 088-647-465-345-499; 090-765-535-856-331; 102-023-565-621-972; 137-180-694-027-100; 147-399-644-412-691,8,False,,,lens

First, we build Financial Stress Index to identify starting dates of systemic financial crises for each country in the panel. Second, early warning indicators for assessment and prediction of systemic risks are selected in a two-step approach; relevant prediction horizons for each indicator are found by the univariate logit model followed by the application of Bayesian model averaging method to identify the most useful indicators. Next, we validate early warning model, containing only useful indicators, for both horizons on the panel. Finally, the in-sample performance of the constructed EWS over both horizons is assessed for the Czech Republic. We find that the model over the 3 years’ horizon slightly outperforms the EWS with the horizon of 1.5 years on the Czech data.

The shift from bank-based to market-based financial systems and from Deferred Net Systems to liquidity-demanding Real-Time Gross Settlement of payments explains some of the shortcomings of traditional liquidity risk management.Although liquidity regulations do exist, they still are in an early stage of development and discussion. Moreover, no all connotations of liquidity are equally addressed. Unlike market and funding liquidity, intraday liquidity has been absent from financial regulation, and has appeared only recently, after the crisis.This paper addresses the measurement of Large-Value Payment System’s intraday liquidity risk. Based on the generation of bivariate Poisson random numbers for simulating the minute-by-minute arrival of received and executed payments, each financial institution’s intraday payments time-varying volume and degree of synchrony (i.e. timing) is modeled.To model intraday payments’ uncertainty allows for overseeing participants’ intraday behavior; assessing their ability to fulfill intraday payments at a certain confidence level; identifying participants non-resilient to changes in payments’ timing mismatches; estimating intraday liquidity buffers.

Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.",2010,99,1,15,Business; Systemic risk; Collateral; Capital levy; Netting; Western hemisphere; Financial system; Capital (economics); Derivatives market,,,,,https://www.elibrary.imf.org/doc/IMF001/10852-9781451982763/10852-9781451982763/Other_formats/Source_PDF/10852-9781451982855.pdf https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF001/10852-9781451982763/10852-9781451982763/10852-9781451982763_A001.xml,https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF001/10852-9781451982763/10852-9781451982763/10852-9781451982763_A001.xml,,,3125699447,,0,,3,False,,,lens

Kapinos,"This paper employs a recent contribution to the construction of the shadow nominal interest rate during the zero lower bound episode of the Great Recession of 2008-2009 and the Greenbook forecasts to obtain a measure of monetary policy shocks over that time period. It then identifies monetary policy news shocks as a novel measure of the forward-looking conduct of monetary policy in the U.S. Using the data from 1987-2010 and impulse responses from the method of local projections, it shows that contractionary monetary surprise and news shocks tended to reduce systemic risk measures over the full sample. In contrast, expansionary monetary news shocks reduced systemic risk at the zero lower bound, whereas surprises had little effect. These findings suggest that the Federal Reserve's efforts at providing expansionary forward guidance at the zero lower bound were successful in stabilizing measures of systemic risk during the Great Recession.",26,4,4932,4945,Shadow (psychology); Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Economics; Forward guidance; Zero lower bound; Surprise; Great recession; Monetary economics; Nominal interest rate,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijfe.2047 https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/ijfiec/v26y2021i4p4932-4945.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijfe.2047,,10.1002/ijfe.2047,2783508879,,0,001-274-723-652-948; 002-449-606-758-848; 004-725-375-972-994; 007-846-205-130-516; 008-162-192-578-002; 008-620-705-366-714; 009-952-107-160-393; 010-384-501-433-161; 013-774-234-232-922; 014-750-510-389-644; 018-899-223-226-691; 019-391-063-263-571; 026-225-214-367-563; 026-717-372-158-557; 029-736-162-261-575; 033-264-994-716-95X; 034-487-297-875-650; 036-760-762-204-068; 038-295-165-765-547; 041-383-051-582-230; 046-083-539-993-84X; 048-363-026-036-293; 056-084-592-994-224; 058-895-938-234-786; 074-000-738-244-955; 082-621-002-452-008; 084-935-029-388-08X; 087-608-182-248-56X; 089-434-742-573-56X; 092-779-562-100-599; 095-583-157-521-079; 102-989-599-088-569; 107-120-910-070-304; 109-632-544-611-546; 115-806-665-215-624; 119-785-011-132-905; 124-263-343-952-806; 132-698-501-481-070; 153-779-195-390-459; 167-725-152-979-022; 167-916-452-423-677; 169-228-638-124-396; 171-253-027-114-689; 196-524-401-795-883,3,False,,,lens

These considerations help analyze the IPO underpricing phenomenon and the problem of price discovery when Serbian companies go public.

We show that, under idealized conditions, high leverage is optimal for banks when there is a market premium for (socially valuable) liquid financial claims and no deviations from Modigliani and Miller (1958) due to agency problems, deposit insurance, taxes, or any other distortions. Our model can explain (i) why bank leverage increased over the last 150 years or so, (ii) why high bank leverage per se does not necessarily cause systemic risk, and (iii) why limits on the leverage of regulated banks impede their ability to compete with unregulated shadow banks. Our model indicates that MM's debt-equity neutrality principle is inapplicable to banks. Because debt-equity neutrality assigns zero weight to the social value of liquidity, it is an inappropriately equity-biased baseline for assessing whether the high leverage ratios of real-world banks are excessive.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",,,,,Baseline (configuration management); Shadow (psychology); Systemic risk; Economics; Market liquidity; Value (economics); Leverage (negotiation); Deposit insurance; Production (economics); Monetary economics,,,,,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2282979 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2282979 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/nber_w19139.pdf?abstractid=2282979&mirid=1&type=2,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2282979,,,3121300760,,0,005-043-466-154-450; 006-434-562-510-114; 031-367-989-064-714; 033-509-825-375-413; 048-911-230-430-305; 049-080-701-146-354; 133-593-801-399-728; 146-016-398-348-497,39,False,,,lens

Instead, we employ the partial least squares (PLS) method that estimates target specific common factors, utilizing covariances between predictors and the target variable. Applying PLS to 198 monthly frequency macroeconomic time series variables and the Bank of Korea's Financial Stress Index (KFSTI), our PLS factor augmented forecasting models consistently outperformed the random walk benchmark model in out-of-sample prediction exercises in all forecast horizons we considered.

The calls for changes in the current systems come on the backdrop of the recognition that the financial fiascos cast a shadow over the ability of codes of conduct, traditional supervisory and enforcement strategies to insulate the global financial sector from failure. In essence, demands for a new architecture in the governance of the pilloried sector are embedded in the critical need to re-instil trust and credibility eroded by inter alia, lack of transparency in the sector. Intertwined with human frailties such as, and mainly, untrammelled greed, excessive ‘group think’ and ‘herd behaviour,’ widespread intransparency engendered a fertile ground upon which scandals flourished. Post-crisis diagnostics have arguably steam-rolled into a governance discussion in which the need for transparency and the importance of ethical and moral aspects of economic activities within the financial services have come to the fore. This paper contributes to that discussion by building on the widely recognised fact that whistle blowing is an essential element of the transparency agenda and that it is a core element of a well-functioning risk management system, it seeks to make a contribution to the literature on global economic governance and financial transparency. The paper is a comparative examination of the degree to which Switzerland and South Africa have enhanced the transformative role of transparency through whistle blowing. This is a crucial quest especially in view of the fact that the recent financial crisis highlighted how internationalised the financial sector has become and demonstrated how, in the absence of harmonized policies and standards, the perils of systemic risk and cross border contagion can easily spread through the global village’s fault lines and vulnerabilities.",,,,,Shadow (psychology); Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Enforcement; Transparency (behavior); Risk management; Market economy; Corporate governance,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/wti/papers/941.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/wti/papers/941.html,,,3124219982,,0,,0,False,,,lens

A literature survey,2010-11-01,2010.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Gunther Capelle-Blancard,"Since the 1970s, the financial system has undergone deep structural changes. Innovation has been a key driver of these changes and most economists acknowledge that the impact has been positive overall. However, each time a financial crisis arises, the debate is on. Derivatives especially, which are among the major innovations of the past thirty years, cause deep concerns. In this paper, we propose a survey of the academic literature that has addressed the threats posed by derivatives. An initial issue is the impact of derivatives on the volatility of the underlying assets, but empirical findings do not suggest any significant effect. The recent literature on the dangers of derivatives is more concerned by systemic risks. Several studies suggest that the sophistication of the products and the concentration of risks are potential sources of instability because of the increasing uncertainty, the repeated occurrence of extreme losses, and finally the greater possibility of global crisis. Among the solutions that have been proposed to mitigate risk, beyond strengthening internal control, putting clearinghouses into general use and limiting naked-transactions seem to be the most promising avenues.",,,,,Futures contract; Systemic risk; Economics; Sophistication; Financial innovation; Financial crisis; Literature survey; Development economics; Speculation; Volatility (finance),,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:cesptp:halshs-00608097 https://ideas.repec.org/p/cii/cepidt/2010-24.html,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:hal:cesptp:halshs-00608097,,,3122588912,,0,,4,False,,,lens

PS calculated on video head impulse test traces was compared between HC and during the acute stage of vertigo (T1) and after 3 months (T2) in superior VN patients. A multiple regression and desirability model between Δ (T2gain − T1gain) vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain and five prognostic factors were employed.

It employs detailed information on the use of capital-based, borrower-based and liquidity-based instruments in 28 European Union countries in 1995—2017 and a macroeconomic panel setup. The paper finds a significant impact of capital buffers, profit distribution restrictions, specific and general loan-loss provisioning regulations, sectoral risk weights and exposure limits, borrower-based measures, caps on long-term maturity and exchange rate mismatch, and asset-based capital requirements on credit to the non-financial private sector. Furthermore, the business cycle and monetary policy influence the effectiveness of most of the macroprudential instruments. Therein, capital buffers and sectoral risk weights act countercyclically irrespectively of the prevailing monetary policy stance, while a far richer set of policy instruments can act countercyclically in combination with the appropriate monetary policy stance.

Doherty; Harris Schlesinger,"High correlations between risks can increase required insurer capital and/or reduce the availability of insurance. For such insurance lines, securitization is rapidly emerging as an alternative form of risk transfer. The ultimate success of securitization in replacing or complementing traditional insurance and reinsurance products depends on the ability of securitization to facilitate and/or be facilitated by insurance contracts. The authors consider how insured losses might be decomposed into separate components, one of which is a type of ""systemic risk"" that is highly correlated among insureds. Such a correlated component might conceivably be hedged directly by individuals but is more likely to be hedged by the insurer.

In this paper we employ a Global VAR (GVAR) model to analyse the systemic risk spillovers across the Euro area and to assess their role in the transmission of monetary policy. The results indicate a strong interconnectedness among core countries and also that peripheral economies have a disproportionate importance in spreading systemic risk. A systemic risk shock results in economic slowdown domestically and causes negative spillovers to the rest of the EMU economies. To examine how monetary policy impacts systemic risk, we incorporate high-frequency monetary surprises into the model. We find evidence of the risk-taking channel during normal times, whereas the relationship is reversed in the period of the ZLB with expansionary shocks to result in a more stable financial system. Our findings indicate that the signalling channel is the main driver of this effect and that the initiation of the QE program boosts the economic activity but results in higher systemic risk. Finally, our results suggest that spillovers play an important role in the transmission of the monetary policy and that there is evidence of significant heterogeneity amongst countries’ responses with core countries to benefit the most from changes in monetary policy.",,,,,Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial contagion; Core countries; Economic slowdown; Sovereign debt; Shock (economics); Monetary economics; Interconnectedness,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/lan/wpaper/326919507.html https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/155069/,https://ideas.repec.org/p/lan/wpaper/326919507.html,,,3164572793,,0,,0,False,,,lens

The aim of this paper is to summarize the most important insights for competition policy that could be derived from the turbulent period 2008–2010. The financial crisis is seen as project that demanded sound management from competition policy and enforcement. The insights will be presented in the instructive form of ‘lessons learnt’ which represents a common approved project management technique. We come to the result that the financial crisis is not the result of ‘too much competition’, but of regulatory failure and that the main answers to the financial crisis have to come from ‘smart regulation’. The relaxation of competition policy would be the wrong policy response in troubled times since competition policy can play an important role in bringing the crisis economy back on track. In contrast to banking we see no economic rationale for rescue packages for other economic sectors by referring to systemic risk. The renaissance of industrial policy is viewed with great skepticism since empirical evidence shows that the effort of picking ‘winners’ all too often results in saving ‘losers’.",38,3,315,330,Systemic risk; Economic sector; Economics; Empirical evidence; Public finance; International economics; Financial crisis; Enforcement; Competition (economics); Market economy; Industrial policy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10663-010-9163-y https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/empiri/v38y2011i3p315-330.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10663-010-9163-y/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10663-010-9163-y.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10663-010-9163-y,,10.1007/s10663-010-9163-y,2092492311,,0,004-961-807-288-374; 030-379-521-342-821; 058-941-103-890-616; 067-396-376-731-990; 068-016-839-722-134; 069-528-528-141-901; 074-455-333-692-793; 077-070-853-851-534; 078-808-039-903-605; 080-805-342-346-694; 084-796-425-228-814; 090-755-744-202-378; 102-169-189-042-513; 109-213-549-073-023; 114-747-806-528-816; 120-843-595-520-386; 141-367-910-360-317; 142-124-192-930-847; 169-481-734-865-206; 193-118-143-228-567; 196-165-102-857-43X,14,False,,,lens

Rouse; Roger B. Daniels,"Derivatives have revolutionized banking, yet little has been done to revolutionize the regulation of such financial instruments. Currently, a number of organizations are participating in the development of proposed regulations of such transactions. This article highlights these developments and provides the reader with some useful insights for meeting the new requirements.Derivatives, a contract whose value depends on (or derives from) the value of an underlying asset, reference rate, or index, have provided corporate management and banking executives new tools to manage their risks. These security transactions are becoming increasingly important as risk management tools in today's financial world and have raised important public policy implications. These financial instruments, often complex transactions, have raised the concerns of many as to the potential abuse which could trigger a crisis in the financial system. The notional value of the derivatives market, the value of the assets underlying the contracts, is reported to be currently at $35 trillion. This amount is equal to approximately three-quarters of all the world's stocks, bonds, money-market securities, and currencies combined! Although few individuals understand the workings of financial derivatives, one Citicorp executive calls derivatives ""the basic banking business of the 1990's.""With fundamental changes taking place in the world's financial markets, especially with the increased volatility in interest rates and currency exchange rates, a number of entities have entered the derivatives marketplace either as dealers or end-users. As many corporations, banks, and government entities utilize these securities, other organizations, including the U.S. Congress, federal regulators, and the accounting profession, are currently involved in the establishment of regulations as well as the accounting and disclosure requirements for financial derivatives. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to highlight and update the banking executive as to the recent concerns and developments in the establishment of regulations for financial derivatives.CONCERNS ABOUT FINANCIAL DERIVATIVESFinancial derivatives are not considered as traditional borrowing or investment instruments. The value of such an instrument is generally derived from the value of an underlying asset, rate, or index. Derivatives are either customized contracts negotiated between two counterparties which are referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, or they are standardized contracts that trade on organized exchanges known as exchange traded derivatives. Futures contracts (foreign currency futures, interest rate futures, and stock index futures) are generally traded on an organized exchange and are typical examples of exchanged traded derivatives. Other derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, are not traded on an organized exchange but are negotiated individually between the parties to the contract and, therefore, are considered as over-the-counter financial derivatives.In a recent speech to the Institute of International Bankers, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig discussed some of the risks associated with financial derivative products. He stated that if banks enter into derivative transactions, they must be able to analyze not only the separate, traditional types of risk-credit, market, liquidity, or operational--but also systemic risk. As financial instruments are created, new risk combinations are formed, often making it difficult to see and understand these new combinations. This covariance among the different types of risks presents a subtle but significant form of systemic risk.With the concentration of the major dealers of derivatives, and the extensive linkage among dealers, end-users and the markets, Congress and federal regulators have expressed concerns as to the ripple effect (systemic risk) that could occur if a major player in a financial derivative transaction incurs a substantial loss. …",7,3,5,,Derivative (finance); Market data; Business; Foreign exchange risk; Financial market participants; Speculation; Financial system; Financial risk; Derivatives market; Financial ratio,,,,,,,,,2240826080,,0,,0,False,,,lens

It describes the functions, accident modes and causes of the various subsystems, the frequency and severity of accidents in detail, but its evaluation result is expressed in a qualitative way abstractly. The fuzzy comprehensive analysis method is a risk assessment method that can express qualitative descriptions in a quantitative way, which can just make up for the insufficiency of the FMECA method. The introduction of FMECA-fuzzy comprehensive analysis method can solve these problems and improve the objectivity of systemic risk assessment, making the evaluation result more reasonable. In order to evaluate the safety of urban natural gas pipeline network system more accurately, based on the FMECA-fuzzy method, we analyze the risk factors of the natural gas pipeline network system in a certain city in-depth, use the analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of the factors in all levels, determine the frequency and severity of various types of accidents in the pipe network system through expert scoring and carry out the natural gas pipeline network system by the FMECA-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation.

Lucas,"I would like to touch briefly on two issues in answer to the question posed for this session: first, the integration of housing finance into the financial and regulatory mainstream; and second, the need to modernize budgetary and regulatory accounting. I have chosen these topics for several reasons. They are important, they get less attention than is deserved, and I have thought quite a bit about them from both an academic and policy perspective. For those of us who have long worried about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — in particular, their spectacular political and market power, their lack of transparency, and the costs and risks to taxpayers associated with their implicit guarantee — the crisis has opened up the tantalizing possibility of rationalizing the structure and regulation of housing finance. Yet, although it is widely agreed that the housing bubble precipitated the financial crisis and that Fannie and Freddie posed a serious systemic risk as “too big to fail” institutions, there is still no official, articulated vision for how housing finance will be structured and regulated in the future. When these issues are mentioned at all, it is usually outside of the broader context of any regulatory restructuring of banking and financial markets. The omission can be seen, for instance, in a series of Treasury proposals for restructuring the financial system — both under the previous",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Law and economics; Financial market; Market power; Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Treasury; Restructuring,,,,,,,,,2480119737,,0,064-490-464-783-848; 100-026-835-558-338; 134-770-275-549-108,0,False,,,lens

It is argued that one of the principal difficulties with deposit protection is that its main aims (consumer protection and the avoidance of systemic risk) indicate that high levels of protection are necessary. However, high levels of protection are seen to raise the problem of moral hazard, where banks and depositors have insufficient incentives to take care in their decision making. The USA has focused on moral hazard from the perspective of bankers' decisions by introducing risk-based premiums. Although this is admirable in theory, it is argued that it is extremely difficult to identify the appropriate premium in practice. The UK has focused its attention on moral hazard as it relates to depositors, and has sought to tackle this by using co-insurance. This paper argues that co-insurance is based upon the premise that consumers are able to make informed decisions about the risks posed by banks, but that this is unrealistic in practice. Furthermore, while coinsurance might, in theory, address moral hazard, it reduces the ability of deposit protection schemes to meet their principal objectives.",5,1,9,20,Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Basel I; Co-insurance; Moral hazard; Incentive; Consumer protection; Corporate governance,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jbr.2340154 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fpalgrave.jbr.2340154.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jbr.2340154,,10.1057/palgrave.jbr.2340154,2017726144,,0,054-305-628-303-055,4,False,,,lens

Despite the lack of evidence to suggest that the parallel banking system either caused or exacerbated the financial crisis, regulation of hedge and private equity funds and over the counter derivatives intensified following 2009 and access to the European markets could be severely curtailed by the extraterritorial imposition of EU regulations. Ostensibly the new regulations have been designed to prevent systemic risk spreading to the system from poorly regulated third countries, and to mark a departure from home state control. However, having examined the Jersey and Guernsey assessments, it will be argued that the prevention of systemic risk is no longer the main concern when assessing equivalent regimes, where market access and reciprocity are key.

At the same time, there remains the probability of certain types of systemic risks, including credit risks. During the pandemic the Russian business debts increased by 14% and reached 62.6% of the countryʼs GDP, which significantly increased credit risks for banks. There is a high concentration of corporate liabilities in Russia - a great part of the debt falls on a small number of large borrowers who are serviced by large banks. It is found that reducing the credit risks and increasing the credit activity of market participants can be achieved both by methods of macroeconomic regulation and by improving the mechanism for analyzing the creditworthiness of corporate borrowers at the level of credit institutions. Measures to minimize credit risks are listed. The formula for the final calculation of the level of credit risk is given. The indicators are analyzed on the basis of the Russian Accounting Standards (RAS) and on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the values of debt burden indicators are considered.

We use the SRISK index to measure the systemic risk contribution of a financial firm. SRISK represents a function of the firm's financial size, its degree of leverage and its expected equity loss conditional on a market downturn. We employ the SRISK to examine the systemic risk of top Greek financial institutions between June 2007 and December 2014 which corresponds to the period of the financial crisis of 2007. The results show that after the crisis of 2007, the SRISK reached its maximum during 2012 and 2013. Then, we find that the Bank of Greece, the National Bank, Piraeus Bank, the Eurobank Ergasias and the Alpha Bank present the top of systemic risk in Greece. In addition, we remark that the change of SRISK, DEBT, EQUITY and RISK of Greek banks is very important which explains the higher degree of instability and recession of the financial system of Greece.",4,1,7,28,Finance; Debt; Business; Systemic risk; Recession; Equity (finance); Financial crisis; National bank; Expected shortfall; Financial system; Leverage (finance),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ajaafi/v4y2015i1p7-28.html https://econpapers.repec.org/article/idsajaafi/v_3a4_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a7-28.htm https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/AJAAF.2015.071751 https://works.bepress.com/abdelkader_derbali/2/,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ajaafi/v4y2015i1p7-28.html,,,2293489209,,0,,7,False,,,lens

OECD and IIASA’s approaches are described. A fundamental challenge to governing systemic risk is understanding the system as a complex network of individual and institutional actors with different and often conflicting interests, values and worldviews. Superimposed on this governance network are the potential risk events with ill-defined chains or networks of interrelated consequences and impacts. The importance of applying a systems approach to both the system to be governed and the governance system is emphasised. The OECD’s ‘whole of society’ approach for managing risk could incorporate IIASA’s suggestions for establishing learning loops to reframe or enable transformative changes and focus attention on the critical nodes that are key to ensuring resilience of economies and societies",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/879c4f7a-en,,10.1787/879c4f7a-en,,,0,,17,False,,,lens
030-161-775-672-941,Is Government Involvement Really Necessary: Implications for Systemic Risk and Crop Reinsurance Contracts,,,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Xiaoguang Feng; Dermot J. Hayes,"Agriculture is subject to substantial systemic risk of crop yield losses due to widespread natural disasters. The systemic risk has been a major obstacle for the development of private crop insurance markets. Driven by spatially correlated weather events, crop losses are highly correlated within a certain area. As a result, the portfolio insurance risk associated with the crop losses has been raised far above what it would be if individual losses were independent, as proposed by Miranda and Glauber (1997). For example, Miranda and Glauber (1997) find that the portfolio risk faced by U.S. crop insurers is about ten times larger than that of conventional insurance lines. Large portfolio risk requires high premium rates to cover the cost of bearing the systemic portfolio risk unless the cost is subsidized. Some national governments, such as the U.S., are willing to provide subsidies and reinsurance for crop insurance policies so that they are affordable to farmers. In this way, the cost of bearing the systemic risk has been transferred to governments. For those countries where there are no government subsidies, private crop insurers would have to charge high premiums, in order to hold large enough reserves for the potential systemic loss or purchase expensive international reinsurance. In this way, the cost of bearing the systemic risk is actually passed onto farmers eventually. Consequently, farmers are either buying extremely expensive insurance to get insured, or being exposed to huge crop loss risks.",,,,,Finance; Agriculture; Crop yield; Portfolio insurance; Business; Systemic risk; Reinsurance; Agribusiness; Crop insurance; Subsidy,,,,,https://works.bepress.com/dermot_hayes/19/ https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ags:aaeacj:184241 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/econ_las_conf/4/ https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/184241 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=econ_las_conf,http://dx.doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.184241,,10.22004/ag.econ.184241,2144894381,,0,001-150-489-244-57X; 002-110-260-972-923; 002-656-366-447-160; 008-387-724-815-96X; 008-631-652-931-989; 010-975-008-675-866; 012-072-588-563-275; 017-488-776-266-308; 019-410-733-698-437; 019-469-047-218-022; 024-869-276-105-017; 026-799-753-733-676; 029-013-475-992-994; 029-401-212-789-796; 040-986-414-642-447; 043-594-818-047-165; 068-870-363-194-737; 070-644-468-127-30X; 090-255-968-396-983; 096-306-267-703-00X; 097-222-159-458-236; 103-911-346-613-181; 118-277-630-927-670; 120-699-828-262-805; 121-714-363-995-599; 147-743-333-715-134; 155-666-368-060-629; 192-278-154-905-005; 192-705-363-745-232,0,False,,,lens

Malz,"This paper describes a set of indicators of systemic risk computed from current market prices of equity and equity index options. It displays results from a prototype version, computed daily from January 2006 to January 2013. The indicators represent a systemic risk event as the realization of an extreme loss on a portfolio of large-intermediary equities. The technique for computing them combines risk-neutral return distributions with implied return correlations drawn from option prices, tying together the single-firm return distributions via a copula to simulate the joint distribution and thus the financial-sector portfolio return distribution. The indicators can be computed daily using only current market prices; no historical data are involved. They are therefore forward-looking and can exploit all the information impounded in current prices. However, the indicators blend both market expectations and the market's desire to protect itself against volatility and tail risk, so they cannot be readily decomposed into these two elements. The paper presents evidence that the indicators have some predictive power for systemic risk events and that they can serve as a meaningful market-adjusted point of comparison for fundamentals-based systemic risk indicators.",,,,,Rate of return on a portfolio; Copula (probability theory); Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Valuation of options; Tail risk; Portfolio; Risk neutral; Financial risk management,,,,,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr607.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241567,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2241567,,10.2139/ssrn.2241567,1954862974,,0,000-846-266-307-085; 014-196-657-975-706; 018-919-882-452-698; 044-134-527-148-352; 046-152-617-765-647; 046-869-657-351-818; 050-873-423-084-338; 060-510-663-804-648; 065-586-452-138-481; 074-637-420-002-073; 078-883-884-677-553; 083-508-652-775-775; 087-268-175-430-322; 088-277-244-440-972; 090-748-781-858-493; 091-761-284-076-151; 112-637-024-452-300; 113-261-056-768-370; 121-736-795-014-069; 122-779-428-131-390; 124-407-930-054-170; 132-999-467-238-024; 134-670-873-398-268; 136-106-944-186-234; 146-237-673-642-391; 152-375-073-224-295; 153-175-347-883-379; 177-524-566-787-962; 193-134-774-216-992; 197-129-658-402-674,8,True,,green,lens

A seminal theoretical work has shown that linear diversification can reduce the risk of a bank failing, but at the cost of increasing systemic risk. Later, a follow-up study showed that a particular strategy of securitization with tranches can help avoid this trade-off. We extend the theoretical work on securitization by considering all possible strategies for securitization with two tranches, by finding their corresponding optimal diversification solutions, and by discussing their implications for individual and systemic risk. We show that securitization that involves exchanging a portion of both tranches brings back the dark side of diversification.

Mishkin,"This paper argues that although financial consolidation creates some dangers because it is leading to larger institutions who might expose the U.S. financial system to increased systemic risk, these dangers can be handled by vigilant supervision and a government safety net with an appropriate amount of constructive ambiguity. Financial consolidation also opens up opportunities to dramatically reduce the scope of deposit insurance and limit it to narrow bank accounts, thus substantially reducing the moral hazard created by the government safety net. Reducing the scope of deposit insurance, however, does not eliminate the need for a government safety net, and thus there is still a strong need for adequate prudential supervision of the financial system. Moving to a world in which we have larger, nationwide, diversified financial institutions and in which deposit insurance plays a very limited role, should improve the efficiency of the financial system. However, it is no panacea: the job of financial regulators and supervisors will continue to be highly challenging in the future.",,,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Consolidation (business); Deposit insurance; Safety net; Constructive; Moral hazard; Ambiguity; Financial regulation; Financial system,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=119829,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=119829,,,1539994225,,0,,20,False,,,lens

The impact of respective measures was affected by front-loading, by the gradual tightening of the limits and by other legislative changes. The highest impact is estimated in 2019, when the volume of newly granted loans was lowered by 17% due to the measures. The estimated impact on residential real estate prices is relatively mild. The current coronavirus pandemic is the first period when systemic risks could have materialized after the implementation of the measures. Due to the possible loan payment deferral the number of loans defaulted has remained relatively low, therefore LTV measures have not been able to limit credit losses. On the other hand, DSTI measures have helped to mitigate credit risk. Households affected the most by the pandemic were those with an already high debt burden even before the outbreak of the crisis.

Discipline is measured by estimating a supply of deposit funds function at Thai banks from 1992 to 1997. The results show that supply decreases as bank-specific risk increases. Also, the sensitivity of funds to changes in bank-specific risk increases as systemic risk rises. Additionally, depositors decrease their sensitivity to deposit rates, decreasing the ability of banks to offset deposit drains by raising rates. Although banking system risk increases, discipline decreases the share of deposits at the riskiest banks.",,,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Market discipline; System risk; Monetary economics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/54492.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/54492.html,,,3141210707,,0,,0,False,,,lens

It also presents the green financing initiatives and role of central banks and supervisory authorities and their monetary and financial policies in enhancing green financing and redirecting finance to low-carbon activities. In the financial sector, the insurance industry is highly vulnerable to such risks. The banking sector is yet to witness the serious impact of these risks. With the slowing of global economic growth, appropriate policies are needed to encourage banks to provide increased green finance with an adequate profitability. Studies recommend that climate-related risk has a strong potential impact on banks’ loan default rate as well as on the financial stability, there is hence a need to incorporate climate-related criteria and the systemic risk arising out of climate change into banks’ decision-making process and risk modelling and management. There is a need for developing an appropriate methodology for assessing and reducing these risks. Moreover, observers also anticipate a need for cooperation between banking regulators and banks to develop and adopt best practices in the management of environmental risks. The environment-related risks will call forth a multi-country, or regional, research office to collect and compile the required data and undertake analysis to enhance the banking sectors’ understanding of, and capacity to address, potential systemic environmental risks. What is needed is to test the feasibility of incorporating forward-looking scenarios for assessing potential impacts of providing credit to environmentally unsustainable or sustainable activities on financial stability.",,,39,56,Finance; Profitability index; Climate change; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Best practice; Energy source; Default; Financial risk,,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1572-832320210000029004/full/epub?title=managing-climate-related-financial-risk-prospects-and-challenges https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1572-832320210000029004/full/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/s1572-832320210000029004,,10.1108/s1572-832320210000029004,3126474319,,0,,0,False,,,lens

Therefore, countries should define their social and technical factors for struggling these problems. The main purpose of this study is to determine the effective strategies to minimize socio-economic burden of these diseases.; Methods; ; For this purpose, 8 different criteria are identified based on the literature analysis. In the evaluation process, the significance levels of these factors are calculated by considering interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) DEMATEL.; Findings:; ; The findings show that technological infrastructure, social distance, and tendency of obeying rules are the most significant items to control these problems. This situation explains that countries should have the necessary equipment to make the diagnosis quickly and effectively. In addition, countries that have effective laboratories in which vaccines and drugs can be developed can be more successful in combating these pandemics. Additionally, it is also defined that cultural factors play also key role to control these problems.; Conclusions; ; In this framework, it is vital that the people in the country take the rules set by the government seriously and without exception. For this purpose, it should be explained to citizens living in the country that personal hygiene, social distance and not entering crowded environments are very important to manage these problems. For this purpose, role model people in the country can be preferred in different platforms so that it can be more effective on the citizens.</jats:p>",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Systemic risk; Multi dimensional; Fuzzy decision; Strategic approach; Computer science,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-39312/v1.pdf https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-39312/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-39312/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-39312/v1,3148810756,,0,,1,True,cc-by,green,lens

The methodological approach used in order to develop this paper starts with a literature review, which establishes the role and place of this research. The analysis made is an empirical one, namely a comparative analysis between the macroprudential and microprudential framework. The analysis shows the fact that the financial system is characterized by a high sensitivity to international pressures, so macroprudential policy through its instruments whishes a better investor protection, a diminishing level of systemic risk and financial stability. The macroprudential policy is known to be a flexible policy, with a higher level of transparency and lower cost of implementation. The study emphasizes the vital need of designing and implementing macroprudential policy in order to prevent macroeconomic and financial imbalances and to ensure financial stability.",,29,353,365,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Financial stability; Investor protection; Lower cost; Financial system,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cmj/interc/y2013i29tomuleasa.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cmj:interc:y:2013:i:29:tomuleasa,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cmj/interc/y2013i29tomuleasa.html,,,160091662,,0,,0,True,cc-by-nd,gold,lens

Firstly,we assume a complete structure of interbank markets to calculate the minimum of contagion risk.We find that under different default loss rates the failure of all developing banks,joint-owned banks and city commercial banks does not have contagion effect.Only the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank have the contagion effect and asset loss accounts for 1.2%.The state-owned banks and joint-owned banks are major players in the interbank market structure.We further assume that city banks lend and borrow money only from developing banks,state-owned banks and joint-owned banks.We find that under this relatively concentrated structure the number of bank failures and capital losses from contagion effect increase significantly.We also consider the combined shock of credit default and liquidity risk.Since banks cannot finance from the failed bank they need to sell parts of liquidity assets and use fire-sail in order to create a good balance sheet.We find that under the combined effect of default credit and liquidity risk,the number of failed banks and capital losses from contagion effect also increase significantly. Finally we conduct an empirical study on micro-characteristics and influencing factors,such as assets,risk exposures and non-performing loans of systematic banks and contagious banks.We find that bank types,assets and risk exposures are main factors to identify systemic banks.In addition,bank types,capital adequacy and exposures are main factors to identify banks that are easy to be affected in crisis.",,,,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Capital adequacy ratio; Interbank lending market; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Capital loss; Financial crisis; Credit default swap; Financial system,,,,,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GLGU201204021.htm,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GLGU201204021.htm,,,2363522938,,0,,2,False,,,lens

To facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a ‘regulatory sandbox’. Regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes). As such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk. Despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model. In our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models. The data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness). Thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models. Our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions.",103,,102237,,Business; Systemic risk; Sandbox (software development); Financial market; Process management; Incubation; System framework; Management research; Qualitative analysis; Design elements and principles,,,,Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/techno/v103y2021ics0166497221000183.html https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/131776 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497221000183 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166497221000183 https://trepo.tuni.fi/bitstream/10024/131776/1/Exploring_a_new_incubation_model_2021.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102237,,10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102237,3133327207,,0,002-496-557-748-96X; 004-155-209-710-815; 008-620-475-815-253; 011-476-369-636-686; 014-932-175-700-497; 015-839-851-769-511; 018-837-381-557-580; 023-197-270-356-194; 023-441-567-797-208; 029-361-723-996-021; 030-683-599-077-569; 034-292-290-870-558; 036-121-757-939-915; 039-040-451-727-762; 039-824-172-242-004; 041-904-200-890-829; 042-169-944-822-974; 043-335-960-870-404; 043-809-027-879-948; 045-462-866-182-570; 045-730-074-708-413; 049-791-323-945-925; 051-254-862-671-976; 051-617-504-140-040; 052-889-238-080-967; 056-286-137-073-787; 056-405-470-601-239; 056-459-150-702-173; 058-680-210-956-120; 059-811-331-152-456; 060-776-785-308-587; 064-864-179-812-981; 068-422-338-687-629; 068-608-387-852-411; 068-837-218-817-032; 069-840-462-767-210; 071-400-241-001-564; 072-962-648-193-474; 079-711-859-746-161; 080-737-325-680-402; 080-833-725-981-01X; 081-029-416-557-118; 089-165-555-221-38X; 093-438-595-994-649; 093-460-296-567-728; 094-373-179-179-84X; 098-189-941-794-218; 102-088-531-243-659; 105-343-412-162-56X; 105-689-019-415-688; 112-856-829-413-309; 116-008-021-289-441; 117-175-633-728-42X; 139-144-801-966-344; 148-895-295-589-702; 151-132-002-003-329; 151-183-048-785-012; 155-729-537-505-189; 180-995-580-446-178,11,True,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid,lens

Our framework uses a combination of macroeconomic, financial and rating factors in representative regions of the world. We formulate a mixed-frequency state-space model to estimate macroeconomic factors. To derive financial risk factors, we use Moody’s/KMV expected default frequencies after accounting for ratings of major financial institutions in the considered regions. The estimated factors are combined to derive probabilities for systemically relevant defaults in the financial industry. Regional macroeconomic factors are significant predictors of the existence and number of systemically important defaults, while regional financial risk and ratings factors are relevant for the existence only.

Beck,"Purpose This study examined the reliability of assessing clinical periodontal measures on third molars, and the association between oral inflammation with periodontal pathology including third molars, and systemic inflammation including negative obstetric outcomes. Patients and Methods Reliability of third molar probing depth (PD) was assessed for 41 patients by trained examiners. The data for the association between oral inflammation with periodontal pathology and systemic outcomes were derived from an IRB-approved study, “Oral Conditions and Pregnancy.” Full mouth periodontal exams including third molars were conducted at less than 24 weeks of pregnancy. Periodontal status, moderate/severe periodontal disease (15 or more sites PD ≥4 mm) was considered as a possible predictor of systemic inflammation and pre-term birth. The upper quartile of the extent of PD for third molars alone (PD ≥4 mm) also was considered as a possible exposure variable for the same outcomes. Chi-square and t tests were used to determine statistical significance (0.05). Significant predictor variables were included in multivariate models. Unconditional logistic multivariate models were used to derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Reliability of PD within 1 mm was excellent, and similar for third molars and non-third molars. Data from 1,020 obstetric patients were available for analysis. Eighteen percent of the patients delivered preterm, at less than 37 weeks. Having moderate/severe periodontal disease excluding third molars, was significantly associated with preterm birth ( P = .008). Results were more significant if third molars were included ( P = .0005). With multivariate models moderate/severe periodontal disease at enrollment including third molar PD, was associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.6). If only the extent of third molar PD was considered, odds also were increased for preterm birth (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1, 5.2). If only the extent of third molar PD was considered at enrollment, odds were increased for serum markers of systemic inflammation, elevated serum CRP, and oxidative stress, 8-isoPGF 2α . Conclusions Dental examiners could reliably assess clinical periodontal measures on third molars. Third molars should be included in studies of systemic outcomes associated with oral inflammation.

In this chapter, corporate scandals will be studied carefully to classify subjects of scandals and their impact. </jats:p>",,,316,338,Business; Systemic risk; Intensive care medicine,,,,,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/corporate-scandals-and-systemic-risk/228065,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-9265-5.ch015,,10.4018/978-1-5225-9265-5.ch015,2942178353,,0,000-183-937-315-277; 002-406-632-046-406; 002-856-834-652-090; 003-727-534-257-801; 004-333-164-926-792; 007-148-313-672-269; 007-198-399-296-537; 009-081-236-033-218; 009-527-065-187-063; 015-801-107-104-091; 020-720-055-740-657; 022-781-938-709-620; 023-137-741-865-012; 023-717-602-168-963; 034-867-782-045-874; 036-405-770-284-081; 037-172-823-162-056; 040-748-636-365-541; 041-206-316-333-655; 042-629-101-008-653; 043-853-611-116-358; 045-941-950-395-841; 046-339-361-208-715; 048-105-257-080-556; 048-946-189-704-748; 052-056-872-845-094; 052-265-352-776-866; 052-788-871-398-417; 054-370-762-688-073; 064-883-254-552-731; 066-469-287-668-027; 071-686-352-789-362; 072-186-826-216-415; 073-176-846-763-501; 075-872-107-578-152; 079-264-190-865-123; 079-925-245-669-003; 080-356-097-238-76X; 092-243-274-945-25X; 092-915-261-729-100; 096-162-609-589-754; 101-889-627-961-405; 102-090-761-225-643; 103-902-630-731-850; 103-908-316-626-945; 104-004-608-176-127; 104-070-305-088-125; 106-233-833-497-375; 110-198-319-103-533; 110-918-627-659-237; 114-735-882-474-233; 118-170-972-414-752; 118-793-186-617-254; 129-080-704-211-342; 130-606-468-523-107; 133-201-800-784-741; 137-395-057-543-557; 142-216-970-475-587; 143-202-786-809-742; 143-561-740-496-001; 144-279-201-424-727; 145-359-934-629-152; 154-473-573-470-347; 162-779-271-909-133; 163-486-031-206-460; 163-509-228-006-023; 165-125-686-710-026; 175-118-409-696-999; 189-849-516-402-500,0,False,,,lens

Ayadi; Nesrine Ayadi; Samir Trabelsi,"This paper aims to analyze the effects of internal and external governance mechanisms on the performance and risk taking of banks from the Euro zone before and after the 2008 financial crisis.,To avoid macroeconomic problems and shocks and because of data availability, the authors select some countries of the Euro zone, namely, France, Belgium, Germany and Finland, during the 2004-2009 period. These countries share similar macroeconomic environments (unemployment, inflation and economic growth rates). All the data relating to the banks are manually drawn from the supervising reports submitted to banks and are available on the banks’ websites and/or on that of the AMF website. The banks included in our sample are drawn from the list of European central banks on www.ecb.int,The empirical results show that banks undertake tradeoffs between different governance mechanisms to alleviate the intensity of the agency conflicts between the shareholders and managers. The findings also confirm that internal mechanisms and capital regulations are complementary and significantly impact bank performance.,This analysis can be extended through studying the interaction between bondholders’ governance and shareholders’ governance and their impact on the 2008 financial crisis.,The changes in banking governance help banks find a useful and necessary way to avoid ill-considered risks that can cause a systemic risk. Therefore, some conditions should be met so that banking governance can contribute to the economic development.,Culture and mentality of good banking governance must grow as much as possible through awareness-raising, training, promotion, recognition of performance, enhancing procedure transparency and stability of good banking governance and regulations, strengthening the national capacity to fight against corruption, and preventive mechanisms.,This paper complements previous studies, mainly those of Andres and Vallelado (2008) who examine the impact of the components of the board on banking performance and of Laeven and Levine (2009) who estimate the combined effect of regulatory and ownership structure on the risk-taking of each bank.",34,3,338,371,Shareholder; Business; Systemic risk; Unemployment; Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Risk taking; External governance; Corporate governance; Financial system,,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MAJ-11-2017-1704/full/html https://ideas.repec.org/a/eme/majpps/maj-11-2017-1704.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/maj-11-2017-1704,,10.1108/maj-11-2017-1704,2907720062,,0,002-737-176-693-55X; 003-935-966-618-216; 004-105-166-079-545; 005-110-643-586-703; 005-547-388-810-107; 006-810-548-406-819; 007-563-518-797-127; 008-475-792-503-861; 009-211-161-401-25X; 011-002-691-504-740; 013-140-563-723-939; 016-606-329-224-817; 017-929-493-512-645; 018-075-278-238-815; 018-498-833-662-522; 018-905-572-489-05X; 020-083-594-530-000; 021-194-568-508-940; 022-956-130-590-235; 023-210-642-814-322; 025-970-470-471-451; 026-608-405-419-969; 027-120-690-217-801; 027-364-670-975-024; 034-300-352-793-103; 037-376-638-097-402; 046-165-382-970-445; 051-070-114-737-953; 051-793-696-714-186; 053-926-711-065-671; 054-998-647-846-80X; 057-129-149-307-584; 060-241-642-024-252; 062-011-026-550-741; 063-643-459-246-106; 064-336-973-854-485; 064-556-375-736-352; 065-218-751-181-827; 065-586-273-464-45X; 066-370-137-735-220; 071-246-086-765-907; 072-564-087-054-947; 073-669-795-870-360; 074-685-302-971-486; 076-036-189-753-825; 076-737-755-018-799; 078-960-636-612-159; 079-244-652-890-991; 081-749-460-502-945; 086-077-195-670-27X; 086-771-766-095-679; 089-330-722-577-567; 089-448-198-204-732; 089-788-739-978-37X; 089-879-608-051-156; 096-527-904-855-583; 098-440-772-229-484; 106-619-997-653-532; 113-006-036-538-14X; 113-538-659-624-674; 116-006-160-207-726; 125-022-510-693-231; 125-360-326-590-365; 135-821-057-843-257; 136-060-856-464-870; 136-551-366-298-183; 136-889-411-284-417; 142-084-600-389-807; 144-126-826-853-292; 146-154-455-465-637; 151-316-334-209-08X; 153-328-363-305-936; 154-229-545-521-181; 162-441-711-496-670; 163-793-315-783-702; 167-431-680-919-003; 179-590-948-161-947; 186-353-504-501-60X; 192-592-479-681-519,8,False,,,lens

This paper also attempts to identify whether the Shariah compliant firms are showing the same micro variables factors that determine systemic risk.  The systematic issues have become the main concern to many related parties such as policy makers, investors and stakeholders as systematic risk is unable to be removed through diversification. Shariah compliant firms have their own unique systematic risk owing to their difference in business philosophy. A hypothesis between the relationship of the firms-specific micro variable factors and systemic risk are established on foregoing studies and theoretical framework respectively, and analyzed using the Fixed Effects Model tested on the data from 80 listed companies covering a period from 2009 to 2018. The results show that leverage and growth are the most significant factors of the systematic risk of Shariah compliant firms.

This question has salience in the context that while bank bailouts solve an immediate problem of systemic risk, they create another set of problems almost as significant. Bailouts involve largescale socialization of private losses, are politically toxic, ideologically contrary to market norms, and economically costly to the state. For these reasons many commentators view the policy to be neither optimal nor desirable, yet it has nonetheless been institutionalized in all modern financial systems. In this paper I argue that the global diffusion of bank bailout policy over the past two centuries is an example of institutional evolution. A process of variation, selection and retention has winnowed down initial variation in responses to possible financial sector collapse to one policy, a state-backed guarantee to bail out the financial system. Understanding the past is a prerequisite for gaining insight into possible futures. Consequently, historical study of bank bailouts will contribute to understanding the future evolution of systemic banking crises by providing insight into the evolution of institutional resilience.",31,3,1065,1088,Futures contract; Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Economics; Universal Darwinism; Bailout; Context (language use); Socialization (Marxism); Market economy; Entrepreneurship,,,,,https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/125200 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/joevec/v31y2021i3d10.1007_s00191-020-00666-8.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-020-00666-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00191-020-00666-8,,10.1007/s00191-020-00666-8,3013854384,,0,000-546-457-387-423; 006-136-623-386-968; 007-447-904-847-980; 010-702-047-713-761; 011-286-440-056-055; 012-193-567-631-495; 013-853-977-390-716; 018-605-676-543-618; 019-494-718-118-044; 021-491-787-195-64X; 023-851-662-160-899; 024-039-720-124-634; 025-589-773-566-041; 026-520-732-424-128; 029-929-709-569-33X; 029-979-751-053-420; 030-520-939-900-536; 031-070-054-905-760; 031-665-004-123-675; 031-890-627-301-416; 033-237-018-677-814; 033-680-511-306-669; 039-262-480-421-416; 039-536-780-978-801; 040-719-216-155-721; 045-189-887-197-988; 045-255-190-818-513; 045-953-275-168-386; 046-231-660-766-536; 046-939-192-136-480; 048-980-402-403-768; 049-551-188-161-956; 052-222-302-909-800; 062-662-921-648-875; 064-195-089-887-677; 065-323-283-288-387; 066-044-456-127-763; 070-727-144-780-306; 072-752-524-486-456; 077-058-768-735-465; 080-015-663-356-870; 082-637-901-252-09X; 083-559-253-110-784; 089-139-642-815-099; 090-851-413-582-652; 092-478-319-698-130; 092-692-890-315-001; 098-909-141-213-238; 106-009-721-939-910; 106-819-330-302-378; 110-777-511-537-514; 114-175-994-604-191; 119-415-289-416-015; 125-713-570-672-101; 126-625-488-389-725; 126-973-492-264-969; 128-226-919-776-634; 129-163-981-604-738; 129-976-459-740-604; 132-260-384-475-272; 133-043-916-402-599; 134-418-277-956-804; 134-773-108-173-768; 152-368-875-884-855; 167-924-775-705-214; 168-068-390-850-880; 168-998-960-584-66X; 174-292-321-656-076; 174-367-817-556-021; 182-945-582-180-526; 190-263-628-734-144; 193-444-425-178-629,4,False,,,lens

This allows us to derive meaningful and improved risk bounds for the joint portfolio in risk factor models with dependence information given by constrained specification sets for the copulas of the risk components and the systemic risk factor. The proof of our main comparison result is not standard. It is based on grid copula approximation of upper products of copulas and on the theory of mass transfers.

In the macro arena, the recognition that price stability was not sufficient to guarantee macroeconomic stability and that financial imbalances developed despite low inflation and small output gaps has highlighted the need for additional tools (macro prudential policies) to complement monetary policy in countercyclical management.

138-920-261-158-612,The regulation of hedge funds under the prism of the financial crisis,,2008.0,,Research Papers in Economics,,,,Michel Aglietta; Sandra Rigot,"This paper deals with two issues. On the one hand, it shows that structural changes in financial markets and in the hedge funds industry make the “light-touch” arguments for regulating hedge funds no longer relevant. On the other hand, pleas for stronger regulation of hedge funds are getting more attention. In the first part of the paper the huge expansion of the industry is outlined and the state of current regulation is highlighted. In the second part an in-depth analysis of risks associated with hedge funds is carried out. It is shown that systemic risk can arise from leverage and from concentration of exposures amongst hedge funds. The part played by hedge funds in the spread of the crisis of structured credit is portrayed. In the third section, the recommendations of professional organisations, regulatory authorities and international institutions are summed up within the framework of risk mapping. This oversight shows the ways of reform: the need of direct regulation, the enhancement of indirect regulation and the overhaul of securitization. The prospective pattern of regulation encompasses macro and micro issues, and impinges upon factors of demand and supply. It emphasizes the enhanced role of public regulators and displays the conditions of an effective market discipline performed by long run institutional investors.",,,,,Finance; Business; Open-end fund; Alternative beta; Commodity pool; Institutional investor; Fund of funds; Hedge accounting; Prime brokerage; Global assets under management,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/drm/wpaper/2008-20.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:drm:wpaper:2008-20,https://ideas.repec.org/p/drm/wpaper/2008-20.html,,,1535615704,,0,009-213-991-193-25X; 013-796-979-120-631; 016-064-840-045-222; 040-184-349-584-732; 064-232-339-869-704; 080-221-503-785-366; 098-587-579-089-885; 114-290-184-140-173; 121-776-725-263-840; 126-393-453-632-510; 128-175-872-506-727; 133-839-750-363-57X; 155-339-645-391-269,7,False,,,lens

Our analysis reveals a light and a dark side of TARP. While announcements as well as capital repayments may provoke positive wealth effects and a decrease in bank risk, equity capital injections to banks are observed to be a severe impediment to restore market confidence and financial stability. Furthermore, while TARP announcements and capital injections may increase systemic risk, no significant effect on systemic risk is found for capital repayments.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Shareholder value; Risk exposure; Bank risk; Financial stability; Equity capital; Monetary economics; Capital (economics); Great Rift,,,,,http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwvfsc13/80004.htm,http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/zbwvfsc13/80004.htm,,,3125869790,,0,,0,False,,,lens

This chapter describes techniques for jointly monitoring the co-evolution of sentiment and systemic risk. To measure systemic risk, we use Marginal Expected Shortfall. To measure sentiment, we apply a behavioral extension of traditional pricing kernel theory, which we supplement with external proxies. We illustrate the technique by analyzing the dynamics of sentiment before, during, and after the global financial crisis which erupted in September 2008. Using stock and options data for the S&P 500 during the period 2002–2009, our analysis documents the statistical relationship between sentiment and systemic risk.",,,,,Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Optimism; Financial crisis; Stochastic discount factor; Overconfidence effect; Expected shortfall; Stock (geology),,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/p/chf/rpseri/rp1150.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/chf/rpseri/rp1150.html,,,2939559818,,0,,0,False,,,lens
079-716-835-283-863,Who Gets a Lifeline? A Political Economy of Corporate Bailouts,2012-07-16,2012.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Michael G. Smith,"Why do some governments opt to provide firms that face bankruptcy with a bailout while others allow the firms to fail? I consider three explanations of bailout provision: one that focuses on the systemic risk posed by the failure of large financial firms, another that examines the conditions under which policymakers are most likely to acquiesce to demands made by the special interests that are directly harmed by the failure of the firm, and a third that highlights the role of the partisan orientation of policymakers in impacting the likelihood of a bailout being given as well as the kinds of firms that receive bailouts. To test these three explanations, I construct a new dataset of 597 financially distressed firms located in 49 countries between the years of 1987 and 2010 that includes firms operating in a wide array of industries by means of media keyword searches. I find evidence in support of the systemic risk and partisanship explanations of bailout provision. Larger firms and firms operating in the financial sector are shown to be more likely to receive bailouts. Further, right-wing governments are 12% less likely to provide a bailout than other kinds of governments, and the positive impact of left-wing governance on bailouts is increasing in the number of employees in a firm.",,,,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Construct (philosophy); Bailout; Financial sector; Corporate governance; Bankruptcy; Financial system,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2110120 http://ncgg.princeton.edu/IPES/2012/papers/F340_rm1.pdf,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2110120,,,2276248771,,0,004-552-678-578-182; 005-774-319-011-328; 006-249-317-301-226; 007-319-603-950-208; 010-973-190-271-876; 012-856-043-047-436; 019-387-957-666-204; 021-338-591-258-046; 023-553-614-751-461; 025-801-277-418-635; 027-572-769-880-056; 028-626-642-851-909; 030-278-618-418-789; 032-456-013-450-542; 047-515-212-112-505; 047-838-205-281-008; 051-020-610-227-404; 051-138-259-192-307; 052-022-634-692-752; 052-751-417-012-845; 053-323-692-638-768; 053-659-957-455-991; 057-045-302-923-589; 059-556-928-114-924; 059-813-202-916-56X; 061-481-507-039-91X; 065-517-883-345-141; 065-938-451-425-100; 066-276-557-052-548; 069-607-748-804-864; 074-081-877-930-67X; 075-631-451-469-679; 085-971-573-734-390; 086-825-334-503-254; 087-140-420-993-282; 096-108-678-033-517; 097-316-186-618-124; 100-204-224-295-662; 102-901-309-420-393; 102-961-034-982-622; 103-015-289-399-08X; 107-760-488-688-189; 108-169-341-991-376; 111-727-111-304-042; 114-963-841-258-23X; 116-802-878-613-034; 124-452-361-130-032; 130-167-093-048-909; 130-214-856-789-633; 130-432-400-302-44X; 145-922-139-792-17X; 147-684-065-453-838; 151-062-977-630-081; 151-656-906-157-512; 156-889-363-939-276; 161-244-990-071-341; 163-190-846-516-790; 170-422-690-906-517; 173-043-949-737-572; 184-894-542-882-430,2,False,,,lens
092-697-367-937-87X,Systemic Risk and Dodd-Frank's Volcker Rule,2013-03-27,2013.0,journal article,William & Mary Business Law Review,,,,Julie Manasfi,"With the recent global financial crisis starting in 2007, the issue of “systemic risk” has attracted much attention in our financial system. Some legislators have asserted that proprietary trading by banking entities, generally the trading of financial instruments for a banking entity’s own account, played a critical role in the recent global financial crisis. These sentiments parallel arguments that the practices of banks and their securities affiliates in the 1920s were partly responsible for the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression. At the heart of these assertions is the issue of whether combining the businesses of commercial banking and investment banking increases systemic risk. The Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall Act) contains provisions that prohibit commercial banks from underwriting, promoting, or selling securities directly or through an affiliated brokerage firm, effectively erecting a wall between commercial banking and investment banking. That wall was gradually weakened and picked apart over the course of the next sixty years or so, finally coming down with the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), which repealed the last remaining restrictions of the Glass-Steagall Act’s wall. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010 makes the most sweeping regulatory changes in this area since the 1930s by reerecting portions of Glass-Steagall’s wall. The Volcker rule, contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, restricts “banking entities” from engaging in proprietary trading, and from sponsoring, or acquiring or retaining certain ownership interests in, a hedge or private equity fund. One of the policy justifications for these restrictions is that the prohibited activities increase systemic risk. The implicit contentions in this justification are that if the prohibited activities are too risky they could Assistant Professor Whittier Law School, 2010–Present; Visiting Assistant Professor in Taxation, Loyola Law School, Los Angeles 2008–2010; Associate, Sidley Austin LLP, 2004–2008; Associate, White & Case LLP, 2003–2004; LL.M. in Taxation, New York University School of Law, 2004; J.D., New York University School of Law, 2003; B.A., University of California Los Angeles, 2000.

The author of this article foresees several possible negative consequences arising from Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which mandates that eligible derivatives be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) that require initial and variation margin. The new legislation also requires that the remaining non-cleared derivatives that are traded by some market participants be more heavily collateralized.; ; ; ; The Act's authors have argued that derivatives pose uniquely dangerous systemic risks because of the leverage and counterparty risk associated with them. Increased collateralization, their thinking goes, would reduce derivatives-related leverage and the systemic risk to the financial system associated with such leverage.; ; ; ; The author argues that these hopes are unduly optimistic because they fail to recognize how market participants can substitute other forms of leverage, such as bank lines of credit or collateral transformation trades, for the leverage derivatives provided previously. The author also believes that the larger collateral mandates and frequent marking-to-market will make the financial system more vulnerable since margin requirements tend to be “pro-cyclical.” And more rigid collateralization mechanisms can restrict the supply of funding liquidity, and lead to spikes in funding liquidity demand that can reduce the liquidity of traded instruments and generate destabilizing feedback loops. The fragmentation of CCPs across jurisdictions and products will lead to greater demand for CCP-eligible collateral to maintain the same level of hedging transactions. This demand will likely be met by using riskier assets as collateral and encourage the shadow banking system to create new assets that can be posted as collateral (for example, via collateral transformation services).; ; ; ; In sum, although the Dodd-Frank rules are intended to reduce systemic risk, their expected impact on liquidity makes it a very open question as to whether they will achieve this goal. Although they may reduce some risks, they will simply shift others while possibly creating new ones.",24,1,67,73,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Liquidity crisis; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Funding liquidity; Collateral; Shadow banking system; Monetary economics,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00366.x https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jacrfn/v24y2012i1p67-73.html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/j_1745-6622_2012_00366_x_wml.pdf?abstractid=2028498&mirid=2 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2028498 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:jacrfn:v:24:y:2012:i:1:p:67-73 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028498,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00366.x,,10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00366.x,1969589747,,0,024-810-698-666-838,11,False,,,lens

Bilodeau; James Guggenheimer,"OBJECTIVES Despite a decline in cigarette smoking in the United States, high rates persist among the socioeconomically underserved who consequently are at risk for smoking-related disease (SRD). Since academically affiliated dental clinics are more likely to encounter underserved patients, smoking interventions could address both the oral and systemic risks of continued smoking. To determine the relevance of providing smoking counseling in the context of SRD, this study examined the prevalence of smoking and its associations with socioeconomic status (SES), SRD and its sequela, and medication use. METHODS Socioeconomic and smoking status was determined from 1,797 electronic health records of a sample of patients at a Pennsylvania dental clinic in 2010. Low SES included patients who were covered by a Medicaid program (MA) or ""self-payers."" High SES encompassed those with an employment-based commercial dental insurance (COM). Self-reported smoking rates were compared with patients' SES, SRDs or sequela, and medications being used for the management of their SRDs. RESULTS Overall, 41.7 percent of these patients were smoking. Smoking was related to SES with the highest rate (52.7 percent) among MA patients compared with 31.5 percent in patients with COM. In addition, 37 percent of patients with SRD or sequela and 33 percent who were taking medications for their management were smoking. CONCLUSIONS Academically affiliated dental clinics are more likely to encounter underserved patients who smoke and have SRD. For greater patient impact and receptivity, it is essential that tobacco cessation interventions emphasize the risks of smoking on systemic as well as oral health.",78,2,154,158,Psychiatry; Socioeconomic status; Psychological intervention; Sequela; Dental insurance; Smoking cessation; Disease; Context (language use); Pharmacotherapy; Family medicine; Medicine,drug therapy; health behavior; health care disparities; health status; nicotine dependence; prescription drugs; smoking cessation; tobacco use disorder,Dental Clinics; Humans; Pennsylvania; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Social Class; United States,,NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR000005) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5924571 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5924571 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphd.12255,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jphd.12255,29077193,10.1111/jphd.12255,2765090524,PMC5924571,0,006-847-237-176-445; 006-893-811-831-764; 009-615-860-760-359; 013-539-135-043-528; 014-710-684-047-883; 015-185-636-224-076; 019-489-454-037-681; 029-877-239-393-904; 031-701-374-238-387; 031-922-036-567-750; 038-225-222-780-871; 039-212-004-016-940; 039-357-049-442-553; 053-353-678-575-649; 054-468-142-628-542; 061-448-648-074-570; 072-377-857-667-00X; 078-679-263-235-279; 079-890-890-844-604; 082-956-968-831-203; 103-570-876-131-902; 105-476-014-156-534; 157-312-476-889-367; 162-517-094-734-503; 166-343-000-701-144,0,True,,green,lens

The paper closes with a brief outlook on future research possibilities and some recommendations for the further development of capital market models incorporating financial contagion.",15,03,1250023,,Financial economics; Asset allocation; Security market line; Economics; Consumption-based capital asset pricing model; Basis risk; Capital asset pricing model; Diversification (finance); Investment theory; Liquidity risk,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/wsi/ijtafx/v15y2012i03ns0219024912500239.html https://www.top1000funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Asset-Allocation1.pdf http://www.top1000funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Asset-Allocation1.pdf https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219024912500239,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s0219024912500239,,10.1142/s0219024912500239,2143093682,,0,000-175-879-168-802; 002-142-520-484-173; 003-134-237-408-42X; 003-877-724-775-187; 004-128-497-402-02X; 006-091-184-178-510; 006-659-120-939-252; 009-096-390-741-572; 009-964-515-673-911; 010-001-854-463-71X; 011-949-400-575-55X; 012-687-265-734-827; 013-118-111-585-482; 013-206-942-213-532; 014-224-076-868-908; 014-417-591-158-960; 016-887-543-783-226; 018-959-681-806-812; 020-042-235-634-501; 020-854-882-880-796; 021-133-339-401-251; 021-271-256-098-248; 023-906-948-416-293; 024-626-268-672-744; 025-222-665-801-250; 026-146-369-419-270; 026-229-185-045-060; 027-573-630-340-252; 030-535-139-992-622; 031-221-583-488-216; 031-813-069-210-923; 032-165-867-083-985; 032-647-867-785-698; 033-907-016-494-109; 034-091-560-879-632; 036-101-661-574-781; 036-208-154-273-984; 037-456-981-590-077; 040-656-029-638-618; 041-148-915-267-159; 041-579-195-116-380; 041-933-720-526-724; 043-737-644-587-588; 044-982-679-653-536; 045-455-610-100-61X; 046-019-020-887-681; 046-352-365-586-832; 047-208-366-756-67X; 047-903-450-545-589; 050-502-049-420-270; 051-390-837-701-033; 053-004-423-764-290; 054-299-988-731-338; 054-567-979-633-160; 056-018-176-792-126; 057-766-725-232-915; 057-837-650-221-319; 057-962-602-117-296; 060-744-144-850-353; 060-955-805-865-027; 063-414-238-395-790; 063-623-630-733-492; 065-818-166-837-361; 067-164-571-347-65X; 067-506-453-015-037; 069-508-497-717-518; 074-769-465-018-081; 077-299-572-678-590; 077-510-291-106-52X; 078-519-971-997-407; 081-264-294-612-376; 082-277-600-786-040; 084-634-617-926-404; 088-670-290-046-803; 089-927-879-427-219; 091-697-140-316-685; 093-472-962-349-238; 095-752-839-016-744; 096-222-799-256-855; 096-423-291-731-011; 096-994-639-840-542; 097-898-926-926-521; 100-723-373-455-599; 103-088-273-301-727; 105-980-341-303-856; 108-156-475-400-399; 111-018-220-968-524; 111-098-048-008-697; 112-948-174-500-687; 113-569-297-675-344; 117-802-574-885-010; 119-445-699-450-07X; 124-650-981-038-832; 125-757-515-003-292; 126-170-435-375-161; 126-521-059-868-14X; 132-722-971-734-420; 134-710-764-183-632; 136-706-062-370-581; 137-677-965-457-916; 138-200-164-181-487; 140-020-746-345-393; 142-570-575-683-249; 147-179-057-352-730; 147-986-901-765-786; 153-497-938-778-417; 153-656-566-313-728; 155-669-644-380-48X; 156-441-933-566-286; 158-407-681-852-676; 167-238-419-755-135; 170-054-128-957-310; 176-308-544-672-352; 179-873-621-661-632; 182-692-769-634-054,8,False,,,lens

This provision is part of a global movement among financial regulators and international institutions to embrace living wills, a movement that began to gather steam after the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008. According to advocates of the new policy, it will help financial regulators identify systemic risks and resolve failing financial firms without escalating those risks. Despite the enthusiasm for living wills among international financial regulators and policymakers across the globe, the regulatory tool itself is still largely conceptual at this stage, and the concept is not well defined.",1,1,7,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Globe; Financial crisis; Enthusiasm; Living Wills; Pre commitment; Bankruptcy; Financial regulation,,,,,https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=aublr https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/aublr/vol1/iss1/7/,https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/aublr/vol1/iss1/7/,,,3123726732,,0,,2,False,,,lens

Especially as risks are becoming more systemic, the systemic risks exhibit much more uncertainties, which is a common challenge in implementing SDGs. The critical challenge is that because of “uncertainties” around SDGs, policy-makers or decision-makers tend to delay actions or decision-making which may likely be a major barrier to implementing SDGs. To seek for how to overcome deep uncertainty, this Chapter provides the analysis of structure of deep uncertainty and its impacts on human society with case studies through perspectives of a resilience approach. Based on this analysis, to overcome deep uncertainty, the Chapter suggests paradigm shifts from linear communication and learning approaches to non-linear communication and co-learning-based approaches toward co-knowledge production based on the resilience approach. This kind of shifts or transformation cannot be done only at the macro level but needs collaboration in linking macro-micro levels.",,,59,77,Resilience (materials science); Production (economics); Macro; Computer science; Knowledge production; Risk analysis (engineering); Psychological resilience; Transformation (genetics); Management science; Knowledge management; Engineering; Business; Psychology; Economics; Social psychology; Biology; Microeconomics; Biochemistry; Physics; Gene; Thermodynamics; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-4345-4_4,,10.1007/978-981-19-4345-4_4,,,0,010-227-909-667-253; 010-616-721-389-510; 013-161-400-461-72X; 013-497-328-534-240; 016-644-703-955-810; 063-696-884-141-128; 075-649-864-595-134; 085-563-380-826-544; 132-590-324-788-72X; 151-090-936-229-329,0,False,,,lens

Utilizing a framework based in Bourdieusian class resources, the analysis moves beyond Beck's rejection of the relevance of class relations to systemic risk, and his critics’ denial that risk transforms existing logics of distribution, to identify key shifts in the relation between contemporary financial risk, power and inequality. The conclusions of this study, showing how systemic financial risk in contexts of organized irresponsibility contributes to differential ‘risk-classes’, suggest that risk is a key source of contemporary inequality and that reconstructing the theory of risk society can illuminate these changes.",44,3,392,417,Positive economics; Sociology; Systemic risk; Power (social and political); Financial crisis; Context (language use); Denial; Risk society; Market economy; Inequality; Financial risk,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03085147.2015.1044850,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03085147.2015.1044850,,10.1080/03085147.2015.1044850,2139241492,,0,001-614-581-566-929; 003-209-382-302-334; 004-854-355-940-179; 005-805-181-447-602; 007-543-172-367-737; 013-640-725-019-41X; 015-120-522-642-90X; 015-871-417-687-572; 016-254-548-408-820; 019-840-726-014-367; 020-768-573-822-823; 022-152-423-799-047; 024-706-967-717-462; 025-499-212-434-285; 031-021-398-492-778; 036-651-880-488-142; 039-991-200-318-247; 041-954-433-630-644; 042-596-309-369-177; 057-867-378-336-658; 058-425-695-070-10X; 060-756-794-191-036; 062-572-577-716-357; 063-751-093-667-202; 066-047-802-752-937; 066-670-472-832-153; 072-442-175-009-462; 072-752-524-486-456; 073-166-791-658-35X; 080-185-064-060-957; 080-833-789-632-628; 082-469-773-176-044; 084-541-279-121-60X; 094-938-467-970-025; 103-895-935-405-383; 104-120-138-135-387; 105-002-879-382-990; 109-859-430-000-823; 119-855-481-474-038; 122-834-729-520-049; 126-389-764-417-808; 140-258-342-040-569; 142-945-657-808-517; 145-823-769-085-150; 148-930-386-354-002; 155-305-262-404-477; 156-953-577-173-011; 168-998-960-584-66X; 170-798-930-987-99X; 179-664-419-930-981; 180-745-989-446-294; 185-539-571-547-316; 188-203-909-664-377; 188-710-383-290-863,23,False,,,lens

137-975-224-983-383,Making OTC Derivatives Safe-A Fresh Look,2011-03-01,2011.0,,,,,,Manmohan Singh,"Recent regulatory efforts, especially in the U.S. and Europe, are aimed at reducing moral hazard so that the next financial crisis is not bailed out by tax payers. This paper looks at the possibility that central counterparties (CCPs) may be too-big-to-fail entities in the making. The present regulatory and reform efforts may not remove the systemic risk from OTC derivatives but rather shift them from banks to CCPs. Under the present regulatory overhaul, the OTC derivative market could become more fragmented. Furthermore, another taxpayer bailout cannot be ruled out. A reexamination of the two key issues of (i) the interoperability of CCPs, and (ii) the cost of moving to CCPs with access to central bank funding, indicates that the proposed changes may not provide the best solution.

077-907-833-850-042,Making Innovation More Competitive: The Case of Fintech,2016-08-20,2016.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Rory Van Loo,"Finance startups are offering automated advice, touchless payments, and other products that could bring great societal benefits, including lower prices and expanded access to credit. Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies were global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the U.S. has lagged in consumer finance. This Article posits that the current competition framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor that has yet to be articulated: the organizational design of administrative agencies. Competition authority—including antitrust and the extension of business licenses—is spread across at least five regulators. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review. No regulator has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote competition in consumer finance. ; Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (“fintechs”) could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of “Too Big To Fail” banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, either fintech startups or the big banks acquiring them may reach the size of technology giants, thereby increasing systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation.",,,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Position (finance); Financial innovation; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Competition (economics); Monopoly; FinTech; Commerce,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2991746_code2155683.pdf?abstractid=2966890&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2966890 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2966890,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2966890,,,2746187949,,0,,4,False,,,lens
185-451-265-644-322,Bank Deposit Insurance and Business Cycles: Controlling the Volatility of Risk-Based Premiums,,2002.0,,,,,,George Pennacchi,"Proposals to make deposit insurance risk-based need to consider how premiums would fluctuate over the business cycle. This paper derives a new deposit insurance contract that has the following three features: 1) it is fairly priced in the sense that the insurer conveys no subsidy to the bank; 2) the insurance rate can be made as stable as desired by lengthening the “average” maturity of the contract; 3) the rate can be frequently updated as new information regarding the bank’s financial condition is obtained. These characteristics are achieved with a contract that is a combination of several long-term ones whose contract intervals partially overlap. Relative to a standard, short-term contract, this “moving average” contract reduces the volatility of a bank’s insurance rates and avoids payment of excessively high premiums during times of financial distress. Estimates of fair insurance rates under such a contract are presented for 42 banks based on data over the period 1987 to 1996. While lengthening the average maturity of the contract reduces the volatility of insurance rates, it also increases the average level of rates since the insurer requires a greater premium for systemic risk. The paper also finds that the distribution of fair insurance rates across banks is skewed, with most banks paying relatively low rates and a small minority of banks paying much higher ones.",,,,,Bond insurance; General insurance; Business; Actuarial science; Business interruption insurance; Deposit insurance; Key person insurance; Auto insurance risk selection; Insurance policy; Risk pool,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedbcp/y2002x3.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:fip:fedbcp:y:2002:x:3 https://www.bostonfed.org/bankinfo/conevent/slowdown/pennacchi.pdf https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/other/pdf/pennacchi.pdf,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedbcp/y2002x3.html,,,2166569294,,0,000-014-986-242-820; 003-611-940-178-792; 008-578-136-345-772; 017-750-425-646-422; 018-533-207-051-848; 021-202-378-000-836; 026-101-903-740-39X; 033-486-484-451-393; 043-483-979-538-932; 063-643-459-246-106; 064-358-818-800-804; 076-143-961-576-478; 088-353-987-780-611; 093-015-612-093-363; 093-996-049-416-469; 104-508-551-344-677; 105-141-987-404-317; 116-199-675-237-792; 154-679-359-209-213; 161-000-396-245-272; 161-779-880-862-119; 182-333-178-880-152,5,False,,,lens

There should be an additional risk premium tied specifically to the systemic risk of the institutions, for example, if it exceeds a normative level, the institution pays for the additional risk taken on. Some sort of after-the-fact discipline such as “contingent capital” may be necessary; for example, debt that automatically converts into equity when losses seriously deplete equity capital.

Major advanced economies have taken policy measures to strengthen the resilience of the financial system since the 2008 global financial crisis. On that basis, the G20 Coherent Conclusions for the Management of Capital Flows Drawing on Country Experiences was established in 2011, followed by discussions among policy circles including the OECD and IMF. Emerging economies have also taken various policy measures to manage systemic risks associated with cross-border capital flows. In 2010, the Korean government and central bank announced foreign exchange-related macroprudential measures (MPMs) aimed at building resilience against external financial shocks. These measures have greatly contributed to limiting systemic risk by curbing excessive capital inflows. Twelve years have passed since the global financial crisis started, and ten years after the introduction of FX-related macroprudential policy measures in Korea. It is now an opportune time to check the performance and effectiveness of these policies. Given the newly heightened risky environment, it is urgent to discuss how to improve macroprudential measures in response to emerging external risks.

Over the last two months, we have experienced a very relevant test of the financial system. At first, we at the Fund viewed this as the first real test of structured credit products — a topic that we had been following and analyzing for some time. But this episode has deepened into more than that, and has raised issues that are at the heart of central banking and financial stability…",,,397,402,Structured finance; Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Financial market; Globalization; Financial crisis; Test (assessment); Financial stability; Financial system,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wsi:wschap:9789812833389_0028,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wsi:wschap:9789812833389_0028,,,2491522049,,0,,0,False,,,lens

He later coauthored a book titled Where the Money Was. See FBI History of Famous Cases & Criminals, https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases [accessed 1 March 2021]., the sector's global interconnectedness, and its high level of digitalization. In response, the private sector has invested vast sums into cybersecurity, and regulators have started to worry about systemic risk. The latter comes in two forms. The first is the risk of a successful cyberattack against a specific financial institution ‘spilling over’ into the broader financial system, hence unintentionally becoming systemic. The second is the national security concern of a systemic cyberattack launched specifically to disrupt the target's financial ecosystem and therefore the real economy. In both cases, the historic evidence is clear: neither type of event has been recorded thus far. Those who consider warnings of systemic cyberattacks to be little more than threat inflation see that as vindication. This paper takes the opposite view and argues that the probability of a systemic cyberattack is significant enough to warrant a higher degree of crossdisciplinary research and preparedness. To support its main argument, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that focuses on answering two key questions. First, are there sufficient known structural vulnerabilities in the financial ecosystem that could be exploited by a willing adversary? And second, are there plausible scenarios that could see an adversarial nation-state launch such an attack? The answer to both is positive. Given the lack of data, this analysis is largely qualitative, based on discussions with regulators, chief risk officers, academic experts, and the author's own multi-decade experience as an active participant in the financial market.",,,95,110,Private sector; Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Warrant; Financial institution; Adversarial system; Financial system; Interconnectedness,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468291 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cycon/cycon2021.html#Vedral21,http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/cycon51939.2021.9468291,,10.23919/cycon51939.2021.9468291,3185440433,,0,,0,False,,,lens
122-105-086-951-370,The Failure of Private Ordering and the Financial Crisis of 2008,2009-03-06,2009.0,,Social Science Research Network,,,,Brian J.M. Quinn,"This Article analyzes the Financial Crisis of 2008 in the context of failures by market participants to engage in private ordering thus leading to opportunistic behavior at the expense of market stability. The Financial Crisis of 2008 offers a decidedly negative verdict on a decades-long project to deregulate financial markets and rely on private ordering mechanisms, including securitization and default swaps, to mitigate opportunistic behavior and improve market efficiency. Although the regulatory approach of the past two decades, which relied in great measure on private parties fending for themselves, helped to generate a number of innovations and positive developments in finance, it ultimately failed to bring about more resilient financial markets. The market for mortgage securitizations found itself subject to adverse selection biases leading to a lemons market for asset-backed securities. At the same time, developments in derivative markets made it possible for central actors there to engage in more risk (moral hazard) than was optimal. Ultimately, parties that should have engaged in private ordering did not. As a consequence, we are left struggling for a new regulatory path forward that recognizes that market participants are human agents subject to the frailties of cognitive limitations, euphoria and perhaps even the occasional self-delusion. What is required is a close examination of the institutional and micro incentives (including incentives of agents) in order to strike a balance between market-based regulation and a more interventionist approach to regulating markets. A more pragmatic approach to market regulation recognizes that the earlier hands-off approach to regulation resulted in over-reliance on weak heuristics and little by way of robust private ordering. A new more pragmatic vision of market regulation will likely stop short of legislating against bubbles, but could, and should, result in less systemic risk and a more sustainable growth trajectory going forward.",,,,,Finance; Market impact; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Financial market; Factor market; Indirect finance; Market depth; Market economy; Market microstructure,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354669 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1367914_code337481.pdf?abstractid=1354669&mirid=4,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1354669,,,1485516838,,0,,0,False,,,lens
