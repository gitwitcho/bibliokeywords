"Haraguchi, M.; Neise, T.; She, W.; Taniguchi, M.",Conversion strategy builds supply chain resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: A typology and research directions,"This study proposes a novel typology of adaptation to hazards-a conversion strategy as a countermeasure to manage risks in interconnected supply chains. Conversion strategies are intended to transform one or multiple supply chain functions for a different one to manage the changing environment. Supply chain disruptions due to natural hazards have been researched in key manufacturing-based economies like Thailand, the US, Japan, and China. Limited studies, however, have looked at the nature of interconnected risks and its effective countermeasures that arise when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt supply chains. Here, we examine systemic risks by contrasting supply chain disruptions caused by natural hazards and the pandemic. Our study investigates whether businesses can manage systemic risks brought on by the pandemic by learning from dealing with disruptions caused by natural hazards. We offer a typology of conversion strategies to demonstrate how conversion strategies can be a successful response to pandemic scenarios. Specifically, we propose six conversion types: production location, production line, storage, usage, distributional channel, and workforce skill set. Then, we conclude with the future research directions as well as the kinds of policy supports required to assist businesses in implementing conversion measures by drawing on prior work addressing natural hazards.",2023,2023-02-02,0,Progress in Disaster Science,conversion; natural hazards; repurposing; supply chain risks; the covid-19 pandemic,Supply chain; Business; Typology; Supply chain risk management; Risk analysis (engineering); Resilience (materials science); Pandemic; Countermeasure; Supply chain management; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Environmental economics; Industrial organization; Service management; Marketing; Economics; Engineering; Medicine; Physics; Thermodynamics; Disease; Archaeology; Pathology; Infectious disease (medical specialty); History; Aerospace engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2023.100276,,lens,003-019-748-504-321

The reductions in systemic risk are stronger for flows coming from source countries with stronger regulatory oversight than the target country.

"Li, E.X.; Lind, G.; Ramesh, K.; Shen, M.",Externalities of accounting disclosures: evidence from the federal reserve,"This study provides the first empirical evidence that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) systematically retrieves micro-level accounting reports to aid its understanding of the state of the macroeconomy. Using unique data identifying its direct access of corporate SEC filings, we show that the Fed tracks firms that are bellwethers and industry leaders, or that can engender systemic risk. The qualitative information in the Fed-accessed periodic reports explains the Fed’s GDP growth forecasts for up to four quarters, after controlling for contemporaneous aggregate earnings and other economic information. However, professional forecasts fail to incorporate such qualitative accounting information. In addition, this qualitative information is reflected in the tone of the ensuing FOMC meeting discussions as well as in Fed forecasts of key macro demand and supply factors. Overall, our evidence suggests important externalities of micro-level accounting reports, especially qualitative disclosures, on the central bank’s macroeconomic forecasts and, by extension, monetary policy.

This study is based on the rationale that stock sectors exhibit heterogeneity in their response to oil prices depending on whether they are classified as oil-intensive or non-oil-intensive sectors and the possible time variation in the dependence and risk spillover effects.Design methodology approachThe authors employ static and dynamic symmetric and asymmetric copula models as well as Conditional Value at Risk (VaR) (CoVaR). Finally, they use robustness tests to validate their .FindingsBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil returns showed an asymmetric tail dependence with all stock sector returns, except health care and industrials (materials), where an average (symmetric tail) dependence is identified. During the COVID-19 pandemic, crude oil returns exhibit a lower tail dependency with the returns of all stock sectors, except financials and consumer discretionary. Furthermore, there is evidence of downside and upside risk asymmetric spillovers from crude oil to stock sectors and vice versa. Finally, the risk spillovers from stock sectors to crude oil are higher than those from crude oil to stock sectors, and they significantly increase during the pandemic.Originality valueThere is heterogeneity in the linkages and the asymmetric bidirectional systemic risk between crude oil and US economic sectors during bearish and bullish market conditions this study is the first to investigate the average and extreme tail dependence and asymmetric spillovers between crude oil and US stock sectors.",2023,2023-02-28,1,International Journal of Emerging Markets,,Spillover effect; Stock (firearms); Economics; Downside risk; Stock market; Econometrics; Tail dependence; Futures contract; Financial economics; West Texas Intermediate; Monetary economics; Business; Portfolio; Microeconomics; Statistics; Mechanical engineering; Paleontology; Mathematics; Horse; Multivariate statistics; Engineering; Biology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijoem-12-2021-1799,,lens,001-664-369-842-40X

In the second approach, systemic risk measures can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash that secures a system by allocating capital to each single institution before aggregating individual risks. Although the theory behind these risk measures has been well investigated by several authors, the numerical part has been neglected so far.

"Kozlova, M.; Yeomans, J.S.",Extending simulation decomposition analysis into systemic risk planning for domino-like cascading effects in environmental systems,"In interconnected environmental systems, the innocuous failure of one component can sometimes trigger a subsequent domino-like effect resulting in a cascading collapse of the entire system. Risk analysis in real world contexts frequently requires the need to simultaneously contrast numerous uncertain factors and difficult-to-capture dimensions. Monte Carlo simulation modelling has often been employed to integrate uncertain inputs and to construct probability distributions of the resulting outputs. Visual analytics and data visualization can be used to support the processing, analyzing, and communicating of the influence of multi-variable uncertainties on the decision-making process. In this paper, the novel Simulation Decomposition (SimDec) analytical technique is extended into complex assessments of cascading risk analysis and used to quantitatively examine situations involving potentially catastrophic, dominolike collapses of an entire system. SimDec analysis proves to be beneficial due to its ability to reveal interdependencies in complex models, its ease of decision-maker perception, its visualizable analytic capabilities, and its significantly lower computational burdens. The case example visually demonstrates that when a system collapse is a low-probability high-impact event, more expensive, reactive policies minimize the overall value loss under conditions of system survival, while more proactive policies enable better loss prevention under system survival. However, proactive approaches significantly decrease the likelihoods and magnitudes of losses for scenarios resulting from the collapse of the system.

"Suarez, J.",Growth-at-risk and macroprudential policy design,"This paper explores the foundations for the application of the empirical growth-at-risk (GaR) approach to the assessment and design of macroprudential policies. It starts considering a stylized benchmark linear specification of the empirical GaR approach in combination with a linear quadratic social welfare criterion that rewards expected GDP growth and penalizes the gap between expected GDP growth and GaR. If the growth rate follows a normal distribution, this welfare criterion can be microfounded as consistent with expected utility maximization under preferences for GDP levels exhibiting constant absolute risk aversion. The benchmark formulation implies an optimal policy rule linear in the risk indicator and an optimal gap between expected growth and GaR that does not depend on the time-varying risk indicator and is inversely related to the cost-effectiveness of macroprudential policy and the risk preference parameter. Extensions of the benchmark formulation show the potential to adapt the analysis and its insights to the richer specifications typically considered in empirical work. Growth-at-risk is an increasingly popular metrics for systemic risk measurement. Adding a welfare criterion delivers a basis for macroprudential policy design. In linear quadratic benchmark case, policy variables respond linearly to risk variables. Optimal policy targets a constant distance between mean growth and growth-at-risk. The setup can be extended to richer empirically relevant formulations.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Journal of Financial Stability,,Macroprudential regulation; Systemic risk; Economics; Monetary economics; Financial system; Financial stability; Monetary policy; Business; Macroeconomics; Financial crisis,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfs.2022.101008,,lens,010-060-995-821-998
"Polat, A.Y.","Investor bias, risk and price volatility","PurposeThis study proposes a framework based on salience theory and shows that focusing on one type of risk (idiosyncratic or systemic) can explain overpricing of securities ex ante, and resales at low prices during crisis periods.Design methodology approachThe author consider an overlapping generations (OLG) model where each generation lives for two periods and there is no population growth. Agents (investors) start their lives with an endowmentgt and have mean-variance utility. They invest their endowment when young and consume when old. Each period, the young investors optimally choose their portfolio from different risky assets acquired from the old generation, all assumed to be in fixed supply.FindingsThe author show that investor salience bias can explain excess volatility of asset prices and the resulting fire-sales in periods of financial turmoil. A change in salience from one component (idiosyncratic) to the other (systemic) will generate excess volatility. Interestingly, higher risk aversion generally exacerbates the excess volatility of prices. Moreover, the model predicts that if a big systemic shock hits the financial system, due to salience bias the price of systemic assets falls sharply. This relates to the observed fire-sales of assets during the global financial crisis.Practical implicationsThe proposed model and suggest that there may be a scope for intervention in financial markets during turbulences. In terms of ex ante policies the study suggests that investors and regulator should use better risk assessment technologies.Originality valueThis is the first study constructing a tractable model based on the argument that investor salience may exacerbate the excess volatility of prices during financial downturns.

Like COVID-19, climate change impacts, and maladaptive responses to them, have potential to disrupt societies at multiple scales via networks of trade, finance, mobility and communication, and to impact hardest on the most vulnerable. However, these complex systems can also facilitate resilience if managed effectively. This review aims to distil lessons related to the transboundary management of systemic risks from the COVID-19 experience, to inform climate change policy and resilience building. Evidence from diverse fields is synthesised to illustrate the nature of systemic risks and our evolving understanding of resilience. We describe research methods that aim to capture systemic complexity to inform better management practices and increase resilience to crises. Finally, we recommend specific, practical actions for improving transboundary climate risk management and resilience building. These include mapping the direct, cross-border and cross-sectoral impacts of potential climate extremes, adopting adaptive risk management strategies that embrace heterogenous decision-making and uncertainty, and taking a broader approach to resilience which elevates human wellbeing, including societal and ecological resilience.",2022,2022-01-11,10,Climate Risk Management,climate change; complex system; covid-19; resilience; systemic risk,Resilience (materials science); Environmental resource management; Risk management; Business; Climate change; Environmental planning; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Risk analysis (engineering); Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Economics; Environmental science; Financial crisis; Ecology; Psychology; Medicine; Finance; Physics; Disease; Macroeconomics; Pathology; Biology; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Psychotherapist; Thermodynamics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2022.100395,,lens,000-649-963-350-369

We distinguish three main types of cyber risks: idiosyncratic, systematic, and systemic cyber risks. While for idiosyncratic and systematic cyber risks, classical actuarial and financial mathematics appear to be well-suited, systemic cyber risks require more sophisticated approaches that capture both network and strategic interactions. In the context of pricing cyber insurance policies, issues of interdependence arise for both systematic and systemic cyber risks classical actuarial valuation needs to be extended to include more complex methods, such as concepts of risk-neutral valuation and (set-valued) monetary risk measures.",2022,2022-08-18,0,Arxiv (cornell University),,Valuation (finance); Systemic risk; Systematic risk; Actuarial science; Context (archaeology); Business; Systematic review; Risk management; Risk analysis (engineering); Economics; Financial crisis; Finance; MEDLINE; Political science; Law; Paleontology; Biology; Macroeconomics,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2209.07415,,lens,008-029-633-344-883
"Schueller, W.; Wachs, J.",Modeling interconnected social and technical risks in open source software ecosystems,"Open source software ecosystems consist of thousands of interdependent libraries, which users can combine to great effect. Recent work has pointed out two kinds of risks in these systems: that technical problems like bugs and vulnerabilities can spread through dependency links, and that relatively few developers are responsible for maintaining even the most widely used libraries. However, a more holistic diagnosis of systemic risk in software ecosystem should consider how these social and technical sources of risk interact and amplify one another. Motivated by the observation that the same individuals maintain several libraries within dependency networks, we present a methodological framework to measure risk in software ecosystems as a function of both dependencies and developers. In our models, a library's chance of failure increases as its developers leave and as its upstream dependencies fail. We apply our method to data from the Rust ecosystem, highlighting several systemically important libraries that are overlooked when only considering technical dependencies. We compare potential interventions, seeking better ways to deploy limited developer resources with a view to improving overall ecosystem health and software supply chain resilience.",2022,2022-05-09,0,Arxiv (cornell University),,Interdependence; Dependency (UML); Computer science; Resilience (materials science); Risk analysis (engineering); Software; Data science; Function (biology); Software engineering; Business; Physics; Evolutionary biology; Biology; Political science; Law; Thermodynamics; Programming language,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.04268,,lens,002-821-058-006-888

To prevent this impact, we require quantitative systemic risk management we can carry out using conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) and a network model. The former measures any targeted entity's tail risk conditional on another entity being financially distressed the latter represents the financial system through a set of nodes and a set of edges. In this study, we modify CoVaR along with its multivariate extension (MCoVaR) considering the joint conditioning events of multiple entities. We accomplish this by first employing a multivariate Johnson's SU risk model to capture the asymmetry and leptokurticity of the entities' asset returns. We then adopt the Cornish-Fisher expansion to account for the analytic higher-order conditional moments in modifying (M)CoVaR. In addition, we attempt to construct a conditional tail risk network. We identify its edges using a corresponding Delta (M)CoVaR reflecting the systemic risk contribution and further compute the strength and clustering coefficient of its nodes. When applying the financial system to global foreign exchange (forex) markets before and during COVID-19, we revealed that the resulting expanded (M)CoVaR forecast exhibited a better conditional coverage performance than its unexpanded version. Its superior performance appeared to be more evident over the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, our network analysis shows that advanced and emerging forex markets generally play roles as net transmitters and net receivers of systemic risk, respectively. The former (respectively, the latter) also possessed a high tendency to cluster with their neighbors in the network during (respectively, before) COVID-19.

"Wen, B.; Gou, S.; Wei, Y.; Hao, J.",Network effects and characteristics of cross-industrial tail risk spillover in china,"In recent years, the Chinese capital market has suffered several violent shocks, and the characteristics of systemic risk contagion across industries and markets have become increasingly important. It brings great potential danger to the stability of financial markets. Therefore, exploring the risk spillover among the real sectors has gradually attracted the attention of scholars. This paper examines the cross-industrial tail risk spillover network in the Chinese financial market. The characteristics and the dynamic contribution of each industry in the tail risk transmission chains are explored. We use the CoES-ENGDFM-LVDN model based on monthly data from 2006 to 2020 to measure the tail risk of 28 industries in China and form a cross-industrial tail risk spillover network. The show that different industries have different levels of spillover and importance in the network. Tail risk mainly spills over from the nonfinancial sector to the financial sector. The nonbank financial industry is the main recipient of tail risk spillover and is becoming progressively more important in the risk network. In addition, with the promotion of industrial structure, emerging industries such as communications, computers, and health care have begun to play more important roles in the tail risk spillover network in China.

"Ilmi, M.; Kasri, R.A.",Portfolio optimization of sharia based assets: indonesia old age security fund (JHT),"As the nation with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesian regulation mandates that social security must be administered in accordance with sharia principles. In November 2021, the Employment Social Security Administration (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) introduced a sharia social security program comprising the Old Age Security (JHT) program. However, there is no specific investment guide for administering these sharia JHT funds, therefore they must be managed as conventional JHT funds domestically. In practice, the domestic Islamic capital market, which is dominated by fixed-income assets, continues to lag the global Islamic stock market. In addition, scholarly research discussing the appropriate management of JHT funds at institutions such as BPJS Ketenagakerjaan is relatively uncommon. Determining the optimal allocation for each asset class in the sharia JHT fund portfolio managed by BPJS Ketenagakerjaan is the purpose of this study. This study uses a quantitative method with a prescriptive model based on Modern Portfolio Theory. The data utilized is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of Islamic mutual funds that are categorized by asset class on the domestic (Indonesian) and international markets for the past five years (2016-2021). The indicate that a portfolio with a 39.95% allocation to foreign assets has an annualized 32% greater expected return than a portfolio limited to domestic assets solely. In addition, the annualized systemic risk of the global portfolio is 5% less than that of the domestic portfolio. These imply that investment management in Islamic JHT funds can be optimized if placement constraints on the domestic Islamic financial market are loosened. This study therefore suggests that these constraints be reevaluated in the future, particularly for institutional investors with big assets under management. The of this study are also anticipated to be useful for other Islamic fund management organizations in identifying the optimal asset allocation for their portfolios, as well as for academics who intend to do further research on Islamic investment management..",2022,2022-11-29,0,"Sustainable Future: Trends, Strategies and Development",,Business; Portfolio; Global assets under management; Foreign portfolio investment; Investment management; Finance; Economics; Institutional investor; Return on investment; Open-ended investment company; Corporate governance; Market liquidity; Production (economics); Macroeconomics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003335832-36,,lens,007-437-985-167-936

This single-center, cross-sectional study of 176 same-sex twin pairs aged 30 to 80 (median 60) years was a component of a framework study of the transition from not having age-related macular degeneration to having early AMD. Drusen categories assessed using fundus photography and optical coherence tomography included small hard drusen (diameter lt 63 μm), intermediate soft drusen (63-125 μm), and large soft drusengt 125 μm), of which the soft drusen are compatible with a diagnosis of AMD. Having 20 small hard drusen within or outside the macula was associated with increasing age, lower body mass index, shorter axial length, hyperopia, female sex, increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high alcohol consumption, and with the presence of soft drusen. Having 20 small hard drusen was associated with some AMD-related risk factors, but not with smoking, increasing body mass index, and higher blood pressure. Having 20 small hard drusen was also associated with soft drusen, in agreement with previous studies. These findings suggest that small hard drusen are not an early manifestation of AMD but the product of a distinct process of tissue alteration that promotes the development of AMD or some subtype thereof.

We use Chen et al.’s (Oper Res 64:1089 1108, 2016) model to construct the decision problem in the experiment. The model assumes that the systemic risk occurs through two channels: the liquidity channel and the network channel. The former occurs from the external investment shock which is endogenous in the balance sheet. The latter is a function of other banks’ clearing repayment which is also caused by the external investment shock. Given these, there are two intuitive optimal strategies in order to avoid a failure: imposing a higher external investment interest than that of its risk and avoiding the financial interactions with the high-risky banks. We use students and bankers as our subjects to check the validity of Chen et al.’s optimal strategy given their respectiveOur show that both students and bankers partially follow Chen et al.’s intuitive optimal strategy: the first strategy.

In fact, the high end of the risk, i.e. where risks become existential, is poorly framed, defined and analyzed by science. This gap is at odds with the fundamental relevance of existential and systemic risks for humanity, and it also limits the ability of scientific communities to engage with the emerging debates and narratives about the existential dimension of climate change that have recently gained considerable traction. amp ltamp gt amp ltamp gt In this contribution we address this gap by scoping and defining existential risks related to climate change. We first review the context of existential risks and climate change, as related to systemic risks and drawing on research in fields such as global catastrophic risks and the so-called amp amp 8220 Reasons for Concern amp amp 8221 in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We also consider how existential risks are framed in the civil society climate movement and what we can learn in this respect from the COVID-19 crisis, which is also a primary learning space for better understanding for both, systemic and existential risks. We then develop a definition that distinguishes between a narrower scope of conditions that threaten survival and basic needs, and a broader scope of conditions that threaten a certain level of well-being, consisting of meeting acceptable living standards. Based on this, we define six dimensions of existential risks of climate change, including the mechanisms they unfold, the systems affected, the dimension and magnitude, the probability of occurrence, time horizon and speed, and the scale of the threat. Our contribution is intended to support further scientific analysis of existential and systemic risks as part of the full risk space associated with climate change. Considering the widespread lag in awareness and regulation related to systemic risks, the of this study should make the risk space better defined, more tangible and hence more conducive to preventive action by policy. amp ltamp gt",2022,2022-03-27,0,,,Existentialism; Climate change; Context (archaeology); Environmental ethics; Scope (computer science); Systemic risk; Political science; Geography; Economics; Ecology; Law; Financial crisis; Computer science; Philosophy; Macroeconomics; Archaeology; Biology; Programming language,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu22-4575,,lens,009-998-455-437-532

"Grabowski, M.",Virtual IBAN as a service in the law of the european union and poland,"The purpose of this paper is to present the two existing virtual account models functioning in the European Union, examine their legal validity and identify the legal challenges related to the functioning of these models. The first model, Mass Payment Accounts, which is related to virtual accounts rather than to virtual IBANs, is the model where the licensed financial institution only provides a business payment (settlement) account, with technical subaccounts, to one of their business clients. The functionality of the subaccounts is limited to reflect and distinguish the incoming payments. The second and more complex model is the vIBAN solution, where the licensed payment institution provides, to another licensed financial institution, indirect access to local payment schemes (hereinafter referred to as vIBAN ). To confirm the legal validity and identify the potential risks of vIBAN services, EU law was analysed with some insights from Polish law. The reason for introducing vIBAN services is the difficulty for certain payment service providers to participate in so-called designated payment systems. Designated payment systems are usually the most widespread local payment systems. The reason for the different treatment of these designated systems is banking systemic risk, understood as a situation where a default by a system participant may result in a default by other participants. Consequently, even if a given payment service provider can obtain its own IBAN number, there is often no possibility for it to participate in designated payment schemes. Bearing in mind the different rules in the case of designated payment systems, the legality of vIBAN services in the EU law is justified by the principle of free movement of services, the principle of equal access to payment schemes and the obligation of the credit institutions to provide banking and non-banking participants with credit institution payment account services on annon-discriminatory and proportionate basis. However, there are various challenges related to the functioning of vIBAN services, such as the overlapping of certain AML CFT obligations, enforcement of administrative and court seizures, AML-related blocking of vIBANs and consistency of money transfer sender data with the Fund Transfer Regulation. The most pressing challenges requiring prompt regulation on the European level are related to the applicable deposit protection scheme, as well as to specific Member States’ administrative restrictions, which can cause difficulties in offering vIBAN services to business entities.",2022,2022-11-30,1,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,Principle of legality; Payment service provider; Payment; Payment system; Settlement (finance); Business; European union; Service (business); Payment order; Institution; Service provider; Financial institution; Actuarial science; Law; Finance; Marketing; Political science; International trade,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jrfm15120566,,lens,001-836-252-782-755
"Heckens, A.J.; Guhr, T.",A new attempt to identify long-term precursors for financial crisis in the market correlation structures,"Prediction of events in financial markets is every investor's dream and, usually, wishful thinking. From a more general, economic and societal viewpoint, the identification of indicators for large events is highly desirable to assess systemic risks. Unfortunately, the very nature of financial markets, particularly the predominantly non-Markovian character as well as non-stationarity, make this challenge a formidable one, leaving little hope for fully fledged answers. Nevertheless, it is called for to collect pieces of evidence in a variety of observables to be assembled like the pieces of a puzzle that eventually might help to catch a glimpse of long-term indicators or precursors for large eventsif at all in a statistical sense. Here, we present a new piece for this puzzle. We use the quasi-stationary market states which exist in the time evolution of the correlation structure in financial markets. Recently, we identified such market states relative to the collective motion of the market as a whole. We study their precursor properties in the US stock markets over 16 years, including two crises, the dot-com bubble burst and the pre-phase of the Lehman Brothers crash. We identify certain interesting features and critically discuss their suitability as indicators.",2021,2021-07-19,0,Arxiv: Risk Management,,Financial economics; Variety (cybernetics); Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Financial crisis; Wishful thinking; Stock (geology); Term (time); Identification (information),http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210709048H/abstract,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210709048H/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09048.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09048,lens,004-770-161-071-122
"Li, Y.; Zhao, H.",A new measurement of systemic risk in china's banking system,"At present, the measurement of systemic risk is still a worldwide challenge. The complex network theory provides a new perspective for the study of this problem. Based on the correlation coefficient between the banks calculated using their default probabilities, this paper builds China's banking networks for the periods of 2008-2019, and analyzes systematically the topological structure of the networks, and determine the size of the systemic risk from the perspective of network topology by using the corresponding characteristics of complex network with the feature of systemic financial risk. It is found that the systemic risk of China's banking industry has a declined tendency before 2018, and the main cause is due to the eigenvector centrality and clustering coefficient declined rapidly. However, after 2018, systemic risk showed a litter upward trend, and the increase of clustering coefficient and eigenvector centrality was the main reason for that upward trend. Before 2018, risk transmission was mainly taken place from local banks and joint-equity commercial banks to state-owned banks, which were the main risk bearers. After 2018, risk contagion mainly occurred among local banks, and some local banks role as systemically important ones. Therefore, dissolving the systemic financial risk in China should strengthen the regulation of local banks. In particular, the high-risk leverage operations and excessively innovative business should be strictly supervised so as to prevent the expansion and spread of the negative effects stemmed from maturity mismatch, maturity transformation and credit transformation.",2021,2021-01-01,1,Journal of Finance and Accounting,,Business; Systemic risk; Network topology; Clustering coefficient; Probability of default; Maturity (finance); Complex network; Financial system; Financial risk; Leverage (finance),http://dx.doi.org/10.11648/j.jfa.20210903.14,https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo?journalid=171&doi=10.11648/j.jfa.20210903.14 https://article.sciencepublishinggroup.com/pdf/10.11648.j.jfa.20210903.14.pdf https://membership.sciencepublishinggroup.com/journal/paperinfo?journalid=171&doi=10.11648/j.jfa.20210903.14,lens,006-674-887-701-851
"Argento, P.; Klotzle, M.C.; Pinto, A.C.F.; Gomes, L.L.",A risk model to compute the volatility and the need for collateral margins in energy futures contracts in brazil,"Purpose Brazil is characterized by the inexistence of a more robust system of guarantees and rules to minimize risks and protect agents in energy futures contracts. In this sense, this study aims to answer the question of how a centralized clearing agent can compute safety margin requirements to help reduce the systemic risk of the energy futures contracts market in Brazil. Design methodology approach The intermediate steps and specificare to analyze the volatility behavior, identify the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects and model the variance of the return series. Based on this, the authors calculate the value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk metrics for the energy futures contracts. As a robustness test, the authors added a peak over threshold methodology from extreme values theory. Findings In general, monthly products require margins because of their higher variance. With the asymmetrical distribution of returns, the authors needed to consider different maintenance margins for the long and short positions. It was also shown that two guarantee margins were required to secure the contracts as follows: the initial margin and the maintenance margin. The three factors that defined the size of the maintenance margin the volatility, skewness and kurtosis of the return series.

However, 20% of patients have a poor outcome with severe neovascular complications. The causal relationship of occlusion in this age group is still unclear in most cases. There are reports of the development of a clinical picture of retinal vein occlusion in patients with COVID-19, the formation of which is most likely due to hypercoagulation syndrome. Purpose. To present a clinical case of post thrombotic retinopathy in a young patient after COVID-19. Material and methods. A clinical example of post thrombotic retinopathy in a young patient with retinal vein occlusion. Conclusion. Management of patients with retinal vein occlusion, especially at a young age, requires a comprehensive diagnostic approach with an assessment of systemic risk factors and mandatory assessment of the initial degree of retinal ischemia according to fluorescein angiography or Optical coherence tomography angiography. The clinical criteria for the increase in retinal ischemia are a decrease in central visual acuity, macular edema, ischemic area increase, and at the later stagesretinal neovascularization and or of the anterior segment of the eye.

Design Population-based cohort study. Setting The Liwan Eye Study, China. Participants 1405 baseline participants aged 50 years and older were invited to attend a 10-year follow-up examination. Primary and secondary outcome measures The International Society of Geographic and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology criteria was used to define glaucoma. Detailed information of mortality was confirmed using the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Presenting visual impairment (PVI) was defined as a presenting visual acuity of less than 20 40 in the better-seeing eye. The 10-year mortality rates were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the association between glaucoma and mortality. A total of 1372 (97.7%) participants with available gonioscopic data were included in the analysis. Of these, 136 (9.9%), 33 (2.4%) and 21 (1.5%) participants had primary angle closure (PAC) suspect (PACS), PAC and PAC glaucoma (PACG), and 29 (2.1%) had primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).

Using quarterly data on U.S. bank holding companies from 2003 to 2016, we document that liquidity creation decreases systemic risk at the individual bank level after controlling for bank size, asset risk, and other bank-specific attributes. After decomposing systemic risk into bank-specific tail risk and systemic linkage, we find that the riskiness of individual banks is negatively linked to liquidity creation. Nevertheless, our also demonstrate that liquidity creation strengthens the systemic linkage of individual banks to severe shocks in the financial system. Overall, our empirical findings demonstrate that the level of liquidity creation may have important implications for financial stability and the prudential supervision of financial institutions.",2021,2021-02-01,0,,,Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Tail risk; Financial stability; Asset risk; Linkage (mechanical); Financial system,https://osuva.uwasa.fi/handle/10024/12317,https://osuva.uwasa.fi/handle/10024/12317,lens,009-137-449-897-458

"Cho, H.; Lehner, O.M.; Nilavongse, R.",Combining financial and ecological sustainability in bank capital regulations,"With the macroprudential approach, systemic risk is explained by a general equilibrium (GE) model. However, since on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet (OBS) risks are structurally segmented, for example annually or periodically on financial statements, the GE model might need further integration with OBS risks including ecological shocks.,This study develops a theoretical two-period model with consumption, investment and loans, which further includes carbon emissions to distinguish between loans for green or brown firms to enhance the perspective of ecological sustainability.,The paper shows how the environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors might be of relevance in the standard bank capital regulatory structure. In dealing with ecological sustainability, a new methodological framework with the green K-index introduces penalties to be paid in the capital structure related to ESG factors. The model is enhanced for screening green or brown firms related to impact investing. The integrated view of financial stability and ecological sustainability further illuminates how a wide cross-sectoral resilience of a green K-index measure for the economy might be achievable.,A stock-flow consistent model with balance-sheet methods raises the question whether all necessary variables and parameters can be computed in practice. Compared to the agent-based model (ABM), this model additionally lacks inputs from agents' behaviour, thus non-rational decisions, which may be relevant in practice. More generally, by adopting a balance-sheet structure, the model shows a coherent framework with relevant variables. The methodology of the GE model with OBS has not been scholarly explored and thus is presented for discussion rather than generalisation. The GE model with OBS provides a new interpretation of systemic risk and interbank relations with a consideration of ecological aspects. Its economic implication contributes to contemporary banking theory as well as to the sustainability discussions in the larger financial sector.,Banks and investors can more carefully measure the ecological risks in their loan portfolios and make better informed decisions leading to a better sustainability of the financial markets.,This study develops a theoretical GE model with off-balance-sheet risks. The model adds green regulation enhancing the capital regulation framework relevant to sustainability.

"Orlovska, Y.; Kiriukhin, R.",Decentralization of power in ukraine problems and prospects for development,"The article reveals the features of the decentralization of power in Ukraine, highlights the current state of reform implementation, and identifies the risks of decentralization. It describes the problems that may arise during the implementation of the tasks of decentralization and possible ways to solve them. As well as problems those hinder the reform of decentralization at the local government level. One of the most effective mechanisms for reforming the public administration system to ensure its efficiency and compliance with the requirements of the time is decentralization. Decentralization is the process of transferring management functions and powers of central authorities to the local level of government. A retrospective analysis of decentralization has established an unjustified delay in its onset. It explained that the actual changes towards decentralization date back to 2014, when the law enshrined the transfer of financial, logistical and other resources to the regions. Determining the prospects for decentralization in Ukraine, the expected risks that this process may cause are analyzed in this article. It is proposed to distinguish systemic risks (corruption, duplication of powers between the state public authorities and the regional public authorities, economic polarization of regions) and situational risks (social, personnel, politicization risk). The normative and legal framework, which is the foundation for the implementation of decentralization reforms in Ukraine, is characterized. and prospects for further research are made regarding positive shifts in the course of the implementation of the reform of decentralization of power in Ukraine.

"Kaucic, M.; Valentinuz, G.; Maggistro, R.; Morganti, M.",Enhanced index-tracking strategies based on systemic financial shocks: A comparison of countries versus sectors investments,"Since the launch of the first replicating funds in the 1970s, index-linked strategies have captured the interest of equity investors. On the one hand, active investing does not generally lead to higher risk-adjusted returns than a passive approach. On the other hand, passive vehicles cannot optimize the risk exposure to the equity markets without introducing elements of active management. The enhanced index-tracking offers all the advantages of traditional passive investing but aims to generate better returns than the reference benchmark. However, in the last decades, the financial system integration increased, reducing the diversification opportunities across markets, and meanwhile, more and more frequent extreme events affected the world. This amplified systemic instability caused unsatisfactory even for these investment strategies. To better manage the markets turmoil and reduce losses, we propose alternative portfolio designs to improve the traditional index-tracking techniques.

"Oyewo, B.",Enterprise risk management and sustainability of banks performance,"PurposeThis study investigates firm attributes (namely level of capitalisation, scope of operation, organisational structure, organisational lifecycle, systemic importance and size) affecting the robustness of enterprise risk management (ERM) practice, the extent to which ERM affects the performance of banks and the impact of ERM on the long-term sustainability of banks in Nigeria. This was against the backdrop that the 2012 banking reform was a major regulatory intervention that mainstreamed ERM in the Nigerian banking sector.Design methodology approachThe study employed a mixed methodology of content, trend and quantitative analyses. Ex post facto research design was deployed to analyse performance differential of banks, with respect to the implementation of ERM, over a 10-year period (2008 2017). A disclosure checklist developed from the COSO ERM integrated framework was used to assess the robustness of ERM by content-analysing divulgence on risk management in published annual reports. The banking reform periods were dichotomised into pre- (2008 2012) and post- (2013 2017) reform periods. Jonckheere Terpstra test, independent sample t-test and Mann Whitney test were applied to analyse a total of 1,036 firm-year observations over the period 2008 2017.FindingsResult shows that bank attributes significantly affecting the robustness of risk management practice are level of capitalisation, scope of operation, systemic importance and size. Performance of banks improved slightly during the post-2012 banking reform period. This suggests that as banks consolidate on the gains of ERM, benefits of the regulatory policy on risk management may be realised in the long run. Result also shows that ERM enhances long-term performance, connoting that effective risk management could serve as a competitive strategy for surviving turbulence that typically characterises the banking sector.Practical implicationsThe emergence of level of capitalisation, scope of operation, systemic importance and size as determinants of ERM provides empirical evidence to support the practice of reviewing the capital requirements for banking business from time to time by regulatory authorities (i.e. recapitalisation policy) as a strategy for managing systemic risk. Top management of banks may consider instituting mechanisms that will ensure risk management is given prominence. A proactive approach must be taken to convert risks to opportunities by banks and other financial institutions, going forward, to cope with the vicissitudes of financial intermediation.Originality valueThe originality of the study stems from the consideration that it provides some new insights into the impact of ERM on banks long-term sustainability in a developing country. The study also contributes to knowledge by exposing the factors determining the robustness of risk management practice. The study developed a checklist for assessing ERM practice from annual reports and other risk management disclosure documents. The paper also adds to the scarce literature on risk governance and risk management.",2021,2021-09-07,2,Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies,,Finance; Business; Enterprise risk management; Financial intermediary; Sustainability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jaee-10-2020-0278,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JAEE-10-2020-0278/full/html,lens,005-309-360-682-509
"Krygier, D.",Essays on systemic risk and financial market volatility,"This doctoral thesis consists of four independent research papers. All papers are empirical and cover the area of financial market risk, with a particular focus on systemic risk and volatility in financial markets.The first paper analyzes the joint effect of centrality and other characteristics that are essential in determining banks’ systemic importance. Specifically, centrality is treated as a moderator variable and the paper analyzes whether characteristics such as size and Value-at-Risk become more, or less, important in determining a bank’s contribution to systemic risk. The main finding is that a bank’s contribution to systemic risk, measured by ΔCoVaR, given a certain level of VaR, is about four times higher for a bank with two standard deviations above average estimated centrality, compared to a bank with average centrality. Neglecting this indirect moderation effect severely underestimates the importance of centrality for risky banks and overestimates it for safer banks.The second paper considers the relationship between the concept of implicit government guarantees and bank equity returns. In alignment with the risk-return trade off, riskier firms should earn higher expected returns. However, risky financial institutions also pose a threat to financial stability and can be considered too big to fail’. From this perspective it can be argued that the risk-adjusted expected return should be lower for highly systemic financial institutions than for less systemic institutions. The paper examines this conjecture from an asset pricing perspective by sorting bank stocks according to the systemic risk measures ΔCoVaR and MES, and compares their risk-adjusted returns. No clear evidence is found that points towards the perception that implicit government guarantees incurred lower risk-adjusted returns during the period 1987-2013 for highly systemic bank holding companies.The third paper investigates the relationship between equity volatility and financial leverage on the firm level. The paper uses a comprehensive dataset of large syndicated loans with a total loan amount in excess of USD12tn. This allows for a precise identification of the date when a company experiences a large change in leverage. In contrast to several previous studies that have relied only on accounting data, the paper finds very clear that increased financial leverage increases equity volatility. The findings are robust to controlling for time trends in variance as well as the type and purpose of the loan.The fourth paper considers volatility dynamics in the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitcoin is also considered extremely volatile and predicting the volatility of any currency or asset is one of the most fundamental tasks for anyone dealing with investment decisions and risk. The paper studies Bitcoin volatility by looking at the link between the volatility in the Bitcoin market and the volatility in other related traditional markets, as well as the general risk level in the financial system. Retail investor driven search volumes on Google, as a possible proxy for investor sentiment, are also considered. The main finding is that there is a relatively strong positive link between Bitcoin volatility and search pressures on Bitcoin-related words on Google, particularly for the search word bitcoinOverall, the point at retail investors, rather than large institutional investors, being major drivers of Bitcoin volatility dynamics.

"Thomas, R.; Vinekar, A.; Mangalesh, S.; Mochi, T.B.; Sarbajna, P.; Shetty, B.",Evaluating contrast sensitivity in asian indian pre-term infants with and without retinopathy of prematurity,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contrast threshold in Asian Indian preterm infants with and without retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) using Newborn Contrast Cards measured during the first ROP screening and to correlate with final outcome and visual acuity atmonths of corrected age. Methods Preterm infants born 2000 grams birth weight (BW) and or 34 weeks gestational age (GA) undergoing ROP screening were enrolled prospectively. Visual acuity was recorded using Teller Acuity Cards. Contrast threshold was measured with Newborn Contrast Cards at first screening visit and at the end of ROP screening at 40 weeks of postmenstrual age or older. Of the 173 study infants, 134 (77.5%) did not have any stage of ROP. Of the remaining 39 (22.5%), 34 (87%) had typeROP and(13%) had typeROP requiring treatment. The mean contrast threshold at the first visit of the no ROP typeand typegroups was 0.36 0.07, 0.65 0.19, and 0.46 0.09, respectively (P 0.001). Contrast threshold had a significant correlation with BW (R -0.291,0.001) and gestational age (R -0.47,0.001). The contrast threshold at the first visit correlated with visual acuity measured atmonths of corrected age in logMAR (R 0.36,0.01). Other than BW and GA, no other systemic risk factors correlated with contrast threshold measured at the first screening visit. Newborn Contrast Cards are a viable tool to test contrast threshold in preterm infants. The association between contrast threshold and ROP, and its correlation with visual acuity, suggest that contrast threshold measurement may help predict the clinical vision outcome among prematurely born infants.

There is now an opportunity to design and implement effective and efficient solutions to manage the financial risks of a future pandemic. This paper suggests a practical framework, informed by the recent experience with COVID-19, for defining a meaningful role for insurance in managing business interruption (BI) and other risks from future pandemics. Policymakers, regulators, businesses, and other stakeholders interacting with representatives from the insurance industry can assist in defining its role in providing protection against the financial consequences of future pandemics.

The article considers the development strategy of the Russian financial market under new economic conditions. s. The purpose is to elaborate theoretical and practical proposals to improve the financial market strategy for boosting investment and economic growth in crisis. Methods. The study rests on strategizing, which allows to propose a number of initiatives to enhance the strategy of the financial market during the crisis period, based on trends, existing competitive advantages and opportunities of the Russian economy. The paper shows the need to continue the transformation of the financial system, based not only on the liberal economic paradigm and recommendations of international institutions on the free movement of capital, but also on the use of its own strategy, aimed at economic development (including in industrial regions), enabling to address environmental factors. In times of crisis, it is necessary to stir up State institutions for development in financial markets, synchronize monetary and fiscal policies, strengthen the regulation of cross-border capital flows, and use the ESG strategies by public companies in Russia. The establishment of some additional restrictions on capital markets and the foreign exchange market by the financial regulator, the support for the ESG approach by State institutions for development and banks will mitigate systemic risks during crisis periods and attract financial resources to long-term investment projects of the real economy, encourage the growth of capitalization of companies, including in regions.",2021,2021-11-29,3,Economic Analysis: Theory and Practice,,Business; Financial market; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.24891/ea.20.11.2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.24891/ea.20.11.2021,lens,010-395-607-178-617
"Yongqi, F.; Haolin, Z.",Has fintech promoted innovation performance,"This study takes 270 cities in China as the research object, reconstructs the influence mechanism of fintech on innovation performance based on the perspective of consumption, and deeply explores the threshold effect and spatial characteristics of the impact of fintech on innovation performance.The are that: First, fintech has a dual threshold effect on innovation performance based on the coverage of fintech. When the coverage is lower than the first threshold, the effect of fintech on innovation performance is not significant. When the coverage crosses the first threshold, the effect of fintech on innovation performance shows the feature of diminishing marginal efficiency as the coverage increases. Second, fintech can improve innovation performance by increasing consumption demand. The lower the consumption demand in the region, the greater the marginal utility of fintech on innovation performance. Third, fintech has a significant space spillover effect on innovation performance and this effect will attenuate as the distance increases. In the Yangtze River Delta region, the spatial spillover effect of fintech on innovation performance is more stronger compared with the national average and the scope of the spillover effect is also wider. In the Pearl River Delta region, the spatial spillover effect of fintech on innovation performance is not significant. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, fintech even shows a spatial extreme effect on innovation performance.Based on the above, we propose the following suggestions: First, we should continue to encourage the development of fintech. We also need to pay attention to preventing systemic risks that may be brought about by fintech at the same time. Second, we must continue to promote the inclusive development of fintech and make fintech achievements to benefit more people. Third, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation in the field of fintech among various regions and expand the radiation scope of fintech. Fourth, we should eliminate the institutional barriers to the flow of fintech elements so as to promote the upgrading of the industrial structure.The contributions are that: First, we use the coverage of fintech as the threshold variable to analyze the nonlinear effect of fintech on innovation performance. Second, we incorporate consumption demand into the influence mechanism of fintech on innovation performance, explore the effect of this mechanism, and further enrich the influence mechanism of fintech on innovation performance. Third, we verify the spatial spillover effect of fintech on improving innovation performance and further explore the boundary of this effect, so as to make up for the deficiencies in the current literature caused by ignoring the spatial spillover effect of fintech and innovation. Fourth, considering the differences in the distribution of financial resources, we analyze the differences of the spatial spillover effect of fintech on improving innovation performance in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, which will provide a certain theoretical and practical reference for China.",2021,2021-09-20,0,,,Consumption (economics); Marginal utility; Systemic risk; Economics; Variable (computer science); Threshold effect; National average; Distribution (economics); Industrial organization; Spillover effect,https://qks.sufe.edu.cn/J/WJGL/Article/Details/aa8ad63e-6810-4ab2-89d7-2f9fe8036eba,https://qks.sufe.edu.cn/J/PDFFull/aa8ad63e-6810-4ab2-89d7-2f9fe8036eba.pdf https://qks.sufe.edu.cn/J/WJGL/Article/Details/aa8ad63e-6810-4ab2-89d7-2f9fe8036eba https://qks.shufe.edu.cn/J/WJGL/Article/Details/aa8ad63e-6810-4ab2-89d7-2f9fe8036eba,lens,004-735-801-346-822
"Lakhina, S.J.; Sutley, E.J.; Wilson, J.",How do we actually do convergence for disaster resilience cases from australia and the united states,"In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis on achieving convergence in disaster research, policy, and programs to reduce disaster losses and enhance social well-being. However, there remain considerable gaps in understanding how do we actually do convergence In this article, we present three case studies from across geographies New South Wales in Australia, and North Carolina and Oregon in the United States and sectors of work community, environmental, and urban resilience, to critically examine what convergence entails and how it can enable diverse disciplines, people, and institutions to reduce vulnerability to systemic risks in the twenty-first century. We identify key successes, challenges, and barriers to convergence. We build on current discussions around the need for convergence research to be problem-focused and solutions-based, by also considering the need to approach convergence as ethic, method, and outcome. We reflect on how convergence can be approached as an ethic that motivates a higher order alignment on why we come together as a method that foregrounds how we come together in inclusive ways and as an outcome that highlights what must be done to successfully translate research findings into the policy and public domains.",2021,2021-03-25,3,International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,,Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Political science; Order (exchange); Vulnerability; Disaster research; Urban resilience; Convergence (relationship); Development economics; Sustainable development,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13753-021-00340-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-021-00340-y https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13753-021-00340-y.pdf,lens,002-125-868-204-932

"Cook, D.; Johannsdottir, L.","Impacts, systemic risk and national response measures concerning COVID-19 the island case studies of iceland and greenland","The Arctic is a remote region that has become increasingly globalized, yet it remains extremely vulnerable to many risks. The COVID-19 pandemic presented new challenges to the region. Using the search, appraisal, synthesis and analysis (SALSA) approach to conduct a meta-synthesis of the academic and grey literature on the impacts of the pandemic, an assessment is conducted of the types of risks that have been presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the scales, and the national response strategies for mitigating the risks. Two case studies are explored: Iceland and Greenland, island nations that exemplify the extremes of the Arctic and reliance on tourism, a sector that was nearly entirely suspended by the pandemic. An evaluative matrix is employed which combines five different scales of risk nano, micro, meso, macro and cosmic with a sustainability categorization of impacts. The risks of the pandemic cut across the respective scale and categories, with the potential for macro-scale events (systemic risk) to unfold linked to economic spillover effects driven by the curtailment of tourism and various supply chain delays. Both Iceland and Greenland have exemplified risk mitigation strategies that prioritize health over wealth, very strictly in the case of the latter. Strict border controls and domestic restrictions have enabled Iceland and Greenland to have much lower case and death numbers than most nations. In addition, Iceland has led the way, globally, in terms of testing and accumulating scientific knowledge through genetic sequencing of the virus. The academic contribution of the paper concerns its broadening of understanding concerning systemic risk, which extends beyond financial implications to includes sustainability dimensions. For policymakers and practitioners, the paper highlights successful risk mitigation and science-based measures that will be useful for any nation tackling a future pandemic, regardless of whether they are island states, Arctic nations or another country.",2021,2021-06-04,1,,,Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Tourism; Geography; Risk management; Development economics; Arctic; Scale (social sciences); Sustainability; Pandemic,http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202106.0134.v1,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202106.0134/v1/download https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202106.0134/v1,lens,000-609-966-415-010
"Bek, T.; Nielsen, M.S.; Klug, S.E.; Eriksen, J.E.",Increasing metabolic variability increases the risk for vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can be treated by retinal photocoagulation, but in some cases, the treatment is initiated too late or is insufficient so that the disease advances to a stage requiring vitrectomy. There is a need to identify risk factors that can predict if patients with PDR will develop complications in need for vitrectomy. Survival analysis with death as competing risk was used to study systemic risk factors for PDR progression to a complication in need for vitrectomy in right eyes of all 1288 diabetic patients from the Aarhus area, Denmark, who had developed proliferative retinopathy in the right eye during the 25 years period fromJuly 1994 untilJuly 2019. The overall cumulative incidence of reaching a vitrectomy end point in the right eye was 24.1% (n 311). In 9.3% (n 120) of the patients where vitrectomy had been performed together with the first photocoagulation, the age of onset of diabetes was significantly higher (p 0.0001), the diabetes duration longer (p 0.035) and BMI higher (p 0.01) than in the patients who had been vitrectomized later than the first photocoagulation. The risk for vitrectomy was significantly increased by high variability of HbA1c before the development of PDR (p 0.0001), but not by other parameters known to increase the risk for developing PDR. Increasing variability of HbA1c before the development of PDR increases the risk for progression to a complication in need of vitrectomy. The need for vitrectomy is unaffected by other risk factors known to increase the risk for developing PDR.",2021,2021-10-08,1,International Ophthalmology,"diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; diabetic retinopathy/diagnosis; humans; light coagulation; photocoagulation; retina; risk factors; survival analysis; vitrectomy; vitreoretinopathy, proliferative",Survival analysis; Ophthalmology; Age of onset; Disease; Diabetic retinopathy; Vitrectomy; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine; Complication; Cumulative incidence,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10792-021-02041-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10792-021-02041-3,lens,009-129-562-643-88X

Methods This is a retrospective cohort study including 330 typediabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients who were followed up from December 2012 to November 2020. Multivariable cox regression analysis identifying factors associated with the hazard of developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) was used to construct the DR risk prediction model in the form of nomogram. 50.6% of participants (mean age: 58.60 10.55) were female, and mean duration of diabetes was 7.09 5.36 years.

Seventy-eight unilateral RVO patients and 70 normal controls were included in the study. OCTA was conducted with the 4.5 4.5-mm scan pattern centered on the optic nerve head, and the RPC density and peripapillary RNFL thickness were quantified. The peripapillary RNFL in the RVO fellow eyes was significantly thinner than in normal controls in the average, inferior-hemisphere, inferior quadrant, and temporal quadrant (P lt 0.05, respectively). The RPC density in the fellow eyes was also significantly lower in the average, inferior-hemisphere, nasal quadrant, and temporal quadrant ((P lt 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in RNFL thickness and RPC density between branch RVO fellow eyes and central RVO fellow eyes. Pearson's correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between the RPC density and RNFL thickness in all measurements (P lt 0.001, respectively). The regional RPC density was reduced in the RVO fellow eyes, which might contribute to peripapillary RNFL thinning in the corresponding region, suggesting the influence of systemic risk factors on RVO.

"Wolf, I.",Political stress and the sustainability of funded pension schemes: introduction of a financial theory,"This study introduces multiplayer game in the modern pension market. Particularly, this study claims that low earners and high earners have different interests when playing in funded pension market scheme. This differentiating is enabled by avoiding the entire society as a single earning cohort. This study using financial position, demonstrates a socio-economic anomaly in the funded pension system, which is in favor of high-earning cohorts at the expense of low-earning cohorts. This anomaly is realized by a lack of insurance and exposure to financial and systemic risks. Furthermore, the anomaly could lead to a pension re-reform back to an unfunded scheme system, due mostly to political pressure. This study found that a minimum pension guarantee is a rebalance mechanism for this anomaly, which increases the probability of a sustainable pension scheme. Nowadays when countries try to balance between social expenses and awaking financial markets, one may find this theory highly relevant. It is obviously one of the cases where social targets meat financial equilibrium and here they are in the same side. Specifically, it is argued that implementing the guarantee with an intra-generational, risk-sharing mechanism is the most efficient way to reduce the effect of this abnormality.",2021,2021-11-03,3,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Position (finance); Balance (accounting); Social security; Put option; Multiplayer game; Pension,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14110525,https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/11/525/pdf https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/handle/10396/22015 https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14110525 https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jjrfmx/v14y2021i11p525-d671232.html https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/11/525,lens,005-508-553-839-017

This in random vector valued fixed-point (FP) equations in large dimensional spaces, and our aim is to study their almost-sure solutions. An underlying directed random graph defines the connections between various components of the FP equations. Existence of an edge between nodes $i,j$ implies the $i$-th FP equation depends on the $j$-th component. We consider a special case where any component of the FP equation depends upon an appropriate aggregate of that of the random neighbour' components. We obtain finite-dimensional limit FP equations in a much smaller dimensional space, whose solutions aid to approximate the solution of FP equations for almost all realizations, as the number of nodes increases. We use Maximum theorem for non-compact sets to prove this convergence. We apply the to study systemic risk in an example financial network with large number of heterogeneous entities. We utilized the simplified limit system to analyse trends of default probability (probability that an entity fails to clear its liabilities) and expected surplus (expected-revenue after clearing liabilities) with varying degrees of interconnections between two diverse groups.

For the Covid-19 case, we model the initial shock based on the loss of labor between March and April 2020 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The industries within the network are assigned a resilience that determines the ability of an industry to absorb input losses, such that if the rate of input loss exceeds the resilience, the industry fails, and its outputs go to zero.

"Ward, P.J.","Towards a multi-risk, multi-sector, systemic approach to risk management","amp ltamp gt Whilst the last decade saw huge scientific advances in understanding natural hazard risks, most research and policy still addresses risk from a single-hazard, single-sector, perspective. This presents obstacles for addressing real-world challenges faced by risk managers and other decision-makers. Firstly, multiple hazards can have interrelated effects on risk. How can risk be better managed by considering these interrelated effects Secondly, disaster risk management (DRM) measures taken to reduce risk from one hazard may increase risk from another hazard. How can we better account for these dynamic feedbacks between risk drivers Thirdly, these interrelated effects have impacts across sectors. How can we account for these trade-offs and synergies across sectors, regions, and hazards The aforementioned challenges exist within the context of an increasingly interconnected world, increased pressure for space, and climate change, in which the magnitude and frequency of single and multi-hazards are changing at an unprecedented rate. A paradigm shift is needed to successfully address these kinds of complex questions and challenges. amp ltamp gt amp ltamp gt amp amp 160 amp ltamp gt amp ltamp gt The vision of the MYRIAD-EU team is to catalyse this paradigm shift required to move towards a multi-risk, multi-sector, systemic approach to risk management. We embark on a research programme that aims to enable policy-makers, decision-makers, and practitioners to develop forward-looking disaster risk management pathways that assess trade-offs and synergies across sectors, hazards, and scales. To do this, we will co-develop a framework for multi-hazard, multi-sector, systemic risk management, and state-of-the-art products and services to operationalise the framework.

"Parisi, F.; Squartini, T.; Garlaschelli, D.",A faster horse on a safer trail: generalized inference for the efficient reconstruction of weighted networks,"Due to the interconnectedness of financial entities, estimating certain key properties of a complex financial system, including the implied level of systemic risk, requires detailed information about the structure of the underlying network of dependencies. However, since data about financial linkages are typically subject to confidentiality, network reconstruction techniques become necessary to infer both the presence of connections and their intensity. Recently, several ""horse races"" have been conducted to compare the performance of the available financial network reconstruction methods. These comparisons were based on arbitrarily chosen metrics of similarity between the real network and its reconstructed versions. Here we establish a generalised maximum-likelihood approach to rigorously define and compare weighted reconstruction methods. Our generalization uses the maximization of a certain conditional entropy to solve the problem represented by the fact that the density-dependent constraints required to reliably reconstruct the network are typically unobserved and, therefore, cannot enter directly, as sufficient statistics, in the likelihood function. The resulting approach admits as input any reconstruction method for the purely binary topology and, conditionally on the latter, exploits the available partial information to infer link weights. We find that the most reliable method is obtained by ""dressing"" the best-performing binary method with an exponential distribution of link weights having a properly density-corrected and link-specific mean value and propose two safe (i.e. unbiased in the sense of maximum conditional entropy) variants of it. While the one named CReMA is perfectly general (as a particular case, it can place optimal weights on a network if the bare topology is known), the one named CReMB (optimized for purely non-deterministic topologies) is faster and reproduces empirical networks with highest generalised likelihood among the considered competing models.",2020,2020-05-01,13,New Journal of Physics,,Conditional entropy; Algorithm; Physics; Entropy maximization; Sufficient statistic; Network topology; Maximization; Complex network; Exponential distribution; Likelihood function; Similarity (geometry); Systemic risk; Generalization; Topology (electrical circuits); Inference; Computer science,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab74a7,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab74a7 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NJPh...22e3053P/abstract http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09829,lens,003-574-718-131-66X
"Haas, A.; Laubichler, M.D.; Applegate, J.M.; Steudle, G.A.; Jaeger, C.",A proposal for integrating theories of complexity for better understanding global systemic risks,"The global financial crisis of 2008 has shown that the present financial system involves global systemic risks. The dimension of these risks is hard to grasp with the conceptual tools that have been developed to tackle conventional risks like fire or car accidents. While modern societies know quite well how to deal with conventional risks, we have not yet been equally successful at dealing with global systemic risks. For managing this kind of risks, one needs to understand critical features of specific global systems where many human agents interact in ever changing complex networks. Here we apply two specific dimensions of complexity theory for dealing with global systemic risk in an integrated fashion: normal accidents and extended evolution. Both of them have successfully been applied to the analysis of systemic risks. As a paradigmatic example of global systemic risks, we focus on the global financial crisis that began in 2008, and suggest that the future evolution of the financial system could either see a further increase in complexity, or a reversal to a less complex system. We explore and contrast the implications of normal accident theory and extended evolution perspectives and suggest a four-point research strategy informed by complexity theory for better understanding global systemic risks in financial systems.",2020,2020-11-03,2,Risk Analysis : an Official Publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,accidents; extended evolution; global financial crisis; global systemic risks; humans; key currency; normal accidents,Risk analysis (engineering); Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Dimension (data warehouse); Complex network; Complex system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.13608,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/risa.13608 https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/a-proposal-for-integrating-theories-of-complexity-for-better-unde https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141485 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.13608,lens,007-971-964-909-451

"Brunnermeier, M.K.; Dong, G.N.; Palia, D.",Banks' non-interest income and systemic risk,"This paper examines the contribution of non-interest income to systemic bank risk. Using the CoVaR measure of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010) as our proxy for systemic risk, we find banks with a higher non-interest income to interest income ratio have a higher contribution to systemic risk. This suggests that activities that are not traditionally associated with banks (such as deposit taking and lending) are associated with a larger contribution to systemic risk. When we decompose total non-interest income into three components, we find trading income and investment banking and venture capital income to be significantly related to systemic risk. The economic impact on systemic risk of investment banking and venture capital income is higher than that of trading income. Finally we find the impact of non-interest income on systemic risk to be prevalent in the 1990 and 2007 financial crises (which were bank based) and not in the case before the 2001 high tech bubble bust. These effects occur one-year before each crisis and not during the recession, showing their countercyclical contribution to systemic risk build-up.",2020,2020-05-11,41,the Review of Corporate Finance Studies,,Net interest income; Systemic risk; Investment banking; Economics; Economic impact analysis; High tech; Recession; Venture capital; Bust; Monetary economics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rcfs/cfaa006,https://wws.princeton.edu/system/files/research/documents/brunnermeier_banks%27_non-interest_income_and_systemic_risk.pdf https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/paper_2012_01_31_0.pdf https://www.princeton.edu/~markus/research/papers/CoVaR_NonInterestIncome.pdf https://collaborate.princeton.edu/en/publications/banks-noninterest-income-and-systemic-risk https://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/3458/paper_nov_2010pdf.pdf https://academic.oup.com/rcfs/article/9/2/229/5835882 http://www.greta.it/credit/credit2011/PAPERS/Speakers/Friday_30/4_Palia.pdf,lens,001-329-199-591-119

"Li, S.X.; Baber, U.",Choice of stents and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease,"Advances in coronary stent technology have led to iterative reductions in the risk of target vessel revascularization (TVR) as well as stent thrombosis (ST) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are characterized by unique risk factors that ought to be considered when selecting a coronary stent. In addition to the systemic risk factors in patients with CKD, atherosclerotic lesions are more calcified, longer, and more vulnerable with a larger necrotic core. Nevertheless, post hoc analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCT) suggest that renal impairment does not augment risk for in-stent late loss. Conversely, renal dysfunction is associated with both an increased risk of thrombotic and bleeding complications following PCI. When comparing stent platforms in patients with CKD, second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) appear more efficacious and safe than bare-metal stents (BMS) with lower risks for TVR, ST, and myocardial infarction (MI). Observational data have questioned the incremental benefit of DES in CKD patients, but it is uncertain how much of the differences are confounded by patient characteristics and study design. RCTs specifically studying post-PCI outcomes in CKD patients are needed along with newer technologies such as polymer-free and antibody-eluting stents to directly address the unique biology and risk factors in CKD patients.",2020,2020-08-04,0,Kidney Disease in the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory,,Internal medicine; Cardiology; Randomized controlled trial; Observational study; Stent; Kidney disease; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Coronary stent; Conventional PCI; Myocardial infarction,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45414-2_7,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-45414-2_7,lens,005-450-518-777-915

We estimate the loss distribution of the EDIS considering different sources of systemic risk associated with the correlations between bank assets inside and outside the eurozone countries, and we analyse the sensitivity of the to bank portfolio risk. We determine the variations in the cost of insurance due to the relative risk profile of banks in the Banking Union and the loss-absorbing capacity of the contribution made by countries with the methodologies proposed by the European Banking Authority (2015). Our findings show how the interconnection between banks of different countries has an important influence on accumulated losses in the tail of the distribution, although the correlation within a country exerts a stronger effect. Both aspects must be considered in the calibration of the target level of the fund to avoid underestimating financing needs. Likewise, deterioration in the quality of bank portfolios produces a significant reduction in the fund's loss-absorbing capacity, which calls into question its soundness in times of economic recession. Finally, we assess the impact of the new contribution scheme on moral hazard and the possibility of cross-border subsidies between the countries of the Banking Union.",2020,2020-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Recession; Carry (investment); Banking union; Deposit insurance; Risk analysis; Moral hazard; Financial system; Subsidy,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3738928,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3738928 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3738928_code2022570.pdf?abstractid=3738928&mirid=1,lens,006-430-632-260-037

"Colon, C.; Brännström, Å.; Rovenskaya, E.; Dieckmann, U.",Fragmentation of production amplifies systemic risks from extreme events in supply-chain networks,"Climatic and other extreme events threaten the globalized economy, which relies on increasingly complex and specialized supply-chain networks. Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firms a measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms.",2020,2020-12-28,3,Plos One,"disasters/economics; economic development/statistics & numerical data; game theory; logistic models; models, economic; resource allocation",Supply chain; Business; Systemic risk; Game theory; Profit (economics); Interdependence; Evolutionary game theory; Extreme events; Stylized fact; Industrial organization,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244196,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370350 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PLoSO..1544196C/abstract https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244196 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244196 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370350 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244196 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/16990/,lens,002-222-157-031-478
"Shavshukov, V.M.; Zhuravleva, N.A.",Global economy: new risks and leadership problems,"After the global crisis of 2008 2009, the world economy entered the era of restructuring. This article focuses on the risks that a new leader will face in the process of shaping the world economy. The methods employed in the research include big data processing of continuous change and the of the symmetric macroeconomic analysis based on the statistics collected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), The Word Bank (WB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Central banks and Treasuries. The study proved that the recessionary processes, their depth and global nature, are caused by a combination of world financial system crises and general civilization problems. These new systemic risks for the world economy might result in new global crises that will limit the resources of international financial institutions for sustainable development. Besides, for most banks these crises will mean shifting a big share of derivatives to the off-balance liabilities, using Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in deals, followed by an increase in state and corporate debts, trade wars, a slowdown of economic development in China, and widening contradictions between global and national finances. Regular research and systematization have developed certain guidelines for the global economic restructuring process. First of all, it is recommended on the base of interstate compromises to focus on international agreements to ensure a solid foundation for global finance. On the basis of the comparative analysis carried out for the USA, China and other counties, it was made clear that no one leader in world economy in 21st century views the world reserve as based on the currency of one country only.

"Kaluge, D.",How we predict the stability of financial sector: the conditional value at risk technique approach,"This study aims to identify the level of systemic risk of each bank and the financial linkages between banks in Indonesia. In this study, researcher uses 41 banks that have been actively traded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in the period 2013-2018. The data of stock capitalization of banks are used as prices in a portfolio of banking system. The method used in this study is the CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) method which was introduced by Adrian and Brunerrmeir in 2008. The equilibrium of the system is assumed reached at optimum portfolio of the system. At this situation each bank contribution to systemic risk is analyzed, as well as its impact onto it when there is a change in capitalization of a certain bank. The result shows the impact of bank onto systemic risk is not always follow its size in contribution the systemic risk. Due to covariance’s among banks are some positive and others are negative, some banks have negative contribution to systemic risk while others’ are positive. There arebanks that have different behavior. These banks have negative contribution to the systemic risk. These banks are BMRI, PNBN, PNBS and NAGA. The negative impact to systemic risk is dominated by BMRI as much as -0.17%, and by PNBN as much as -0.04%. There aremajor banks that have contribution to systemic risk BBCA (3,01% or Rp 59,1 trillion) and BBRI (0,54% Rp 10,62 trillion). However their impact on systemic risk are different. The parameters of impact on systemic for BBCA and BBRI are 14,99% and 52,94% respectively. Thus the stability of the system is more sensitive to the volatility of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) than of Bank Central Asia (BBCA).

We first establish that in the German interbank lending market, a few large banks intermediate funding flows between many smaller periphery banks and that shocks to these intermediary banks in the financial crisis spill over to the activities of the periphery banks. We then develop a network model in which banks trade off the costs and benefits of link formation to explain these patterns. The model is structurally estimated using banks’ preferences as revealed by the observed network structure in the precrisis period. It explains why the interbank intermediation arrangement arises, estimates the frictions underlying the arrangement, and quantifies how shocks are transmitted across the network. Model estimates based on precrisis data successfully predict changes in network-links and in lending arising from the crisis in out-of-sample tests.

"Elie, R.; Ichiba, T.; Laurière, M.",Large banking systems with default and recovery: A mean field game model,"We consider a mean-field model for large banking systems, which takes into account default and recovery of the institutions. Building on models used for groups of interacting neurons, we first study a McKean-Vlasov dynamics and its evolutionary Fokker-Planck equation in which the mean-field interactions occur through a mean-reverting term and through a hitting time corresponding to a default level. The latter feature reflects the impact of a financial institution's default on the global distribution of reserves in the banking system. The systemic risk problem of financial institutions is understood as a blow-up phenomenon of the Fokker-Planck equation. Then, we incorporate in the model an optimization component by letting the institutions control part of their dynamics in order to minimize their expected risk. Phrasing this optimization problem as a mean-field game, we provide an explicit solution in a special case and, in the general case, we report numerical experiments based on a finite difference scheme.",2020,2020-01-28,8,Arxiv: Optimization and Control,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Order (exchange); Hitting time; Financial institution; Computer science; Component (UML); Term (time),https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10206,https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10206 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200110206E/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10206.pdf http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2001.10206,lens,002-980-554-930-541
"Meuleman, E.; Vennet, R.V.",Macroprudential policy and bank systemic risk,"This paper investigates the effectiveness of macroprudential policy to contain the systemic risk of European banks between 2000 and 2017. We use a new database (MaPPED) collected by experts at the ECB and national central banks with narrative information on a broad range of instruments which are tracked over their life cycle. Using a dynamic panel framework at a monthly frequency we assess the impact of macroprudential tools and their design on the banks’ systemic risk both in the short and the long run. We furthermore decompose the systemic risk measure in an individual bank risk component and a systemic linkage component. This is of particular interest because microprudential policy focuses on the tail risk of an individual bank while macroprudential policy targets systemic risk by addressing the interlinkages and common exposures across banks. In general, the announcements of macroprudential policy actions have a downward effect on bank systemic risk. On average, all banks benefit from macroprudential tools in terms of their individual risk. We find that credit growth tools and exposure limits exhibit the most pronounced downward effect on the individual risk component. However, we find evidence for a risk-shifting effect which is more pronounced for retail-oriented banks. The effects are heterogeneous across banks with respect to the systemic linkage component. Liquidity tools and measures aimed at increasing the resilience of banks decrease the systemic linkage of banks. Moreover, these tools appear to be most effective for distressed banks.

"Gortsos, C.V.",Other specific tasks and competences of the european central bank relating to financial stability,"This chapter elaborates on the other specific tasks and competences of the European Central Bank (ECB) relating to financial stability. Its specific tasks in the context of the European Systemic Risk Board are discussed in the first section, while the second deals with the limited, albeit important competences of the ECB within the Single Resolution Mechanism, drawing attention to its role in relation to resolution planning and early intervention, the conditions for resolution within the resolution procedure and, in particular, its role in determining that a credit institution is failing or likely to fail’, as well as to the write-down or conversion of relevant capital instruments. Finally, the third section discusses the (still) limited role of the ECB in the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) mechanism in respect of last-resort lending to credit institutions in the euro area, which permits the conclusion that the provision of ELA is not considered to be part of the single monetary policy in the euro area and falls under the main responsibility of the national central banks concerned.",2020,2020-02-15,0,Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions,,Monetary policy; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Single Resolution Mechanism; Context (language use); Institution; Intervention (law); Financial system; Capital (economics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34564-8_9,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-34564-8_9.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-34564-8_9,lens,005-732-053-419-477

Despite its popularity, at the state of the art, a rigorous definition of connectedness is still missing. In this paper we propose a general definition of connectedness introducing the notion of proper measures of connectedness (PMCs). Based on the classical concept of mean introduced by Chisini, we define a family of PMCs and prove some useful properties. Further, we investigate whether the most popular measures of connectedness available in the literature are consistent with the proposed theoretical framework. We also compare different measures in terms of forecasting performances on real financial data. The empirical evidence shows the forecasting superiority of the PMCs compared to the measures that do not satisfy the theoretical properties.

Several studies have shown association between severity of retinal hard exudates and various components of serum lipid. The aim of this study is to estimate the proportion of severity of retinal hard exudates with risk factors like dyslipidemia, duration of diabetes, hypertension, HbA1c levels and microalbuminuria. Methods: A hospital based cross sectional study was done involving 242 diabetic retinopathy patients. After dilated fundus examination, severity of retinal hard exudates was graded by photographs with Topcon fundus camera using modified airlie house classification. These grades were divided into three groups. Group(absent or minimal hard exudates) included patients with grade 0,orhard exudates group(hard exudates present), included patients with gradeorhard exudates and group(prominent hard exudates), patients with gradehard exudates. Values of serum lipid profile, HbA1C and urine microalbumin were analysed in association with severity of retinal hard exudates.Out of the 242 diabetic retinopathy patients, the male female ratio was 1:1 and the mean age was 59.8 7.4 years. There were 12% patients in group one, 52.5% in group two and 35.5% in group three. On univariate analysis, severity of hard exudates was significantly associated with serum cholesterol (p value 0.01), LDL (p value 0.01) triglycerides (p value 0.01), HbA1c (p value 0.01), systemic hypertension (p value 0.01) and urine microalbumin (p value 0.01).Severity of retinal hard exudates in diabetic retinopathy patients is significantly associated with risk factors like systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, raised HbA1C levels and urine microalbumin.",2020,2020-12-22,1,International Journal of Advances in Medicine,,Internal medicine; Univariate analysis; Dyslipidemia; Lipid profile; Dilated fundus examination; Diabetic retinopathy; Retinal; Microalbuminuria; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine; Gastroenterology,http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2349-3933.ijam20205470,https://www.ijmedicine.com/index.php/ijam/article/view/2681/1862 https://www.ijmedicine.com/index.php/ijam/article/download/2681/1862,lens,005-642-693-762-178

This financial information is derived from processes and their related monetary flows within a business. But as the flows are becoming larger and more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to distill the primary processes for large amounts of transaction data. However, by extracting the primary processes we will be able to detect possible inconsistencies in the information efficiently. We use recent advances in network embedding techniques that have demonstrated promising regarding node classification problems in domains like biology and sociology. We learned a useful continuous vector representation of the nodes in the network which can be used for the clustering task, such that the clusters represent the meaningful primary processes. The show that we can extract the relevant primary processes which are similar to the created clusters by a financial expert.

Henry Thornton eloquently defended the Bank of England's actions as the lender of last resort and saw its discretionary management of liquidity as the key stabilizer of the credit system. In contrast, Jeremy Bentham advocated the imposition of strict bank regulations and examinations, without which, he predicted, Britain would soon experience a systemic crisis which he called ""universal bankruptcy."" There are strong parallels but also dramatic differences with our recent attempts to reduce systemic risk within financial systems. The Basel III bank regulatory framework effectively intertwines Bentham's and Thornton's diametrically opposed approaches to stabilizing banks.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the burden of pruritus and factors associated with its presence and severity among older adults recruited to the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research study. Seven hundred seventy individuals aged 55 years (lower age limit) and above were interviewed as to whether they experienced pruritus during the preceding week and the locations involved if present. The association between generalised pruritus, sleep quality, and major systemic risk factors were explored. 5.97% of respondents reported generalised pruritus. Generalised pruritus was associated with poorer sleep quality, with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score above 6. Mean haemoglobin level was lower in subjects with generalised pruritus (13.14dL) but there was no significant difference in the frequency of generalised pruritus and severe generalized pruritus between subjects with clinically defined anaemia. Also, there were no significant associations between other major systemic risk factors and generalised pruritus in this population-based study. There was no association between generalised pruritus with depression, anxiety or stress. The negative effect of pruritus on sleep quality suggests a possible deleterious effect of pruritus on health and quality of life.

"Ponamorenko, V.E.",The concept of fintech law in the context of modern requirements for the formation of lawyers’ professional competencies,"Subject of research. The conceptual and methodological aspects, in the context of developmental trends in the subject and system of financial law, of training specialists in the field of FinTech Law. PurposeTo formulate conceptual and practical proposals which could transform the financial law system also, to provide lawyers with the methodological foundations to form a comprehensive financial and legal library in the context of the digitalization of the economy. MethodologyWhen searching and systematizing educational programs in the fields of digital law and FinTech Law, both a literature review and a comparative method were used. To organize national strategies for the digitalization of the economy, a formal legal method was used. In formulating the author’s concept of a financial law system (in which the FinTech Law legal institution could occupy a space), a systematic and integrated approach was used. In formulating methodological proposals for the integration of legal, financial and digital literacy, a competency-based approach was used. The author argues that globalization must be a prerequisite for the foundations, both scientifically and educationally, underlying the FinTech Law Institute. In finance, globalization has manifested itself both negatively (through the systemic risk that emerged amidst the global financial crisis) and positively (through the creation of a new, risk-oriented system of international and national regulations, financially and legally, which are sensitive to ongoing digital challenges). Based on a review of experiences undertaken, both in Russia and abroad, to develop the scientific and educational basis of FinTech Law, the author formulates proposals to further develop this topic and to transform the financial law system. These include implementing three large entities (sub-sectors) in the form of monetary law, fiscal law, and financial market law, as well as the integrated institute of FinTech Law. The author offers his own version of a structure this legal institution can use. Discussion. The article offers proposals, conceptually and practically, for transforming the system of financial law, and for improving the methodological foundations required to form a comprehensive financial and legal library for lawyers in the context of globalization and digitalization. It also substantiates the important position that FinTech Law occupies in systems for the professional training of lawyers. The of the study can be used in the development of the scientific doctrine of financial law, or in the methodological foundations of the formation of complex competencies of lawyers through the formation of financial, legal and digital literacy.",2020,2020-05-17,5,Digital Law Journal,,Systemic risk; Political science; Position (finance); Law; Globalization; Doctrine; Financial literacy; Financial crisis; Context (language use); Professional development,http://dx.doi.org/10.38044/dlj-2020-1-1-59-70,https://www.digitallawjournal.org/jour/article/download/7/21 https://www.digitallawjournal.org/jour/article/view/7,lens,005-978-987-061-835

"Ros, G.",The making of a cyber crash: A conceptual model for systemic risk in the financial sector,"In October 2017, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) set up a group whose was to examine cyber security vulnerabilities within the financial sector, and their potential impact on financial stability and the real economy. In its first year, the European Systemic Cyber Group (ESCG) sought to develop a shared understanding of Common Individual Vulnerabilities (CIVs) across ESRB members, and to identify the unique characteristics of cyber risk that could contribute to a systemic event. Building on this work, this paper describes a conceptual model for systemic cyber risk, and aims to: provide a structured approach that can be used to describe cyber incidents, from genesis through to a potential systemic event demonstrate the link between the crystallisation of cyber risk in a firm-specific context(portraying microprudential concerns), and the possible ramifications for the financial system (applying a macroprudential focus) identify system-wide vulnerabilities and the unique characteristics of cyber incidents which can act as amplifiers, thereby propagating shocks through the financial system support the use of historical or theoretical scenario-based analysis to demonstrate the viability of the model suggest system-wide interventions that could act as systemic mitigants.

"Ramadiah, A.",The quest for accurate systemic stress tests,"After the global financial crisis of 2007-09, network approaches have become more prominent for analysing systemic risk in financial networks. Accordingly, various systemic stress testing models have been introduced in the literature. However, relatively little work has been devoted to study the accuracy of these models to predict systemic risk. This is especially important, given that stress tests are subjected to a range of modelling choices. In this thesis,address this gap by studying the impact of modelling choices on the outcome of stress tests.mainly focus on indirect contagion channel due to common assets holdings (overlapping portfolios) between financial institutions. In particular, this thesis is concerned with three aspects of stress tests related to indirect contagion: (i) the network of interactions, (ii) the dynamics of contagion, and (iii) the perimeter, or the types of institutions that are included in the stress test. With regard to the first aspect, the network of financial linkages between financial institutions is often lacking, and one has to resort to network reconstruction methods to infer the network from partial information. In this thesis,conduct a horse race between different network reconstruction methods in terms of their ability to reproduce the topological features and the levels of systemic risk of the actual bank-firm credit networks in Japan.find that there is no single ""best"" network reconstruction methodit depends on the assumed criterion of interest, but the reconstruction method which preserves the actual degree distribution overall consistently performs best. Furthermore,find that the observed credit network displays relatively high levels of systemic risk compared with most reconstruction methods. Concerning the second aspect, the propagation of shocks between financial institutions is usually modelled by means of effective dynamics, which are only approximations of the true dynamics. In this thesis,introduce a generalised stress testing model that captures a wide range of behavioural assumptions with regard to banks' liquidation dynamics under stress. The literature has proposed two alternative classes of liquidation dynamics in this regard, all of which are covered by my model: threshold dynamics (banks liquidate their investment portfolios only after they have defaulted), and leverage targeting dynamics (banks constantly rebalance their portfolios to maintain a target leverage ratio).test the capability of the generalised model to predict actual bank defaults (and non-defaults) in the United States for the years 2008-10.find that the model performs better than alternative benchmarks that do not account for the network of common asset holdings, irrespective of the assumed liquidation dynamics.also show how the best performing liquidation dynamics depend on the combination of the initial shock level and the market impact parameter, on the cross-sectional variation in the market impact parameter, and on the number of asset liquidation rounds. Finally, with respect to the third aspect, it is mandatory to define the types of financial institutions that the stress test covers. In this thesis,study the impact of common asset holdings across different financial sectors on financial stability. In particular,model systemic risk arising from indirect contagion between UK banks, UK open-ended investment funds and UK insurance companies.show that performing a stress simulation that accounts for common asset holdings across multiple sectors in systemic losses that are 47% larger than those obtained by summing the losses of sector-specific stress simulations. In other words, ignoring common asset holdings between different financial sectors may result in an underestimation of systemic risk.",2020,2020-09-28,0,,,Market impact; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Asset (economics); Financial networks; Financial crisis; Stress test; Default; Leverage (finance),https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10110551/,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10110551/,lens,007-044-495-622-257
"Dimmelmeier, A.",The role of economic ideas in sustainable financefrom paradigms to policy,"This thesis investigates how economic ideas have shaped the evolution of sustainable finance between 1998 and 2018. Sustainable finance has become an ever more salient topic as financial institutions, governments and central banks have looked for ways to integrate sustainability concerns. The thesis develops a transmission mechanism that outlines how ideas from economic theories influence the frames that are adopted by policy actors. The transmission of ideas is investigated through network analysis, content analysis, interviews and participant observation. The thesis outlines four frames that actors utilise to conceptualise sustainable finance: (1) a socially responsible investment frame (2) a risks and opportunities frame (3) a climate finance frame and (4) a critical frame. It finds that after an initial preoccupation with ethical questions, the most influential actors have framed sustainable finance in terms of risks and opportunities. The economic ideas that underpin most of these frames come from mainstream finance. Nonetheless, the recent emphasis on systemic risks has meant that actors like central banks have started to explore less orthodox ideas. With regards to transmission of frames to policy outcomes, the thesis finds that most of the debates have been about how to understand and implement a risks and opportunities approach. Importantly, the incorporation of economic ideas into the design of performative socio-technical instruments is a stronger transmission channel than the persuasion of policymakers. The findings in the thesis contribute to constructivist International Political Economy. First, the proposed transmission mechanism clarifies how economic ideas affect policy in a non-linear manner. Second, the study of a case of evolution contributes to the understanding of ideational dynamics in non-crisis times. The thesis also adds to the literature on environmental politics since understanding the thinking of actors and the functioning of instruments allows for assessments of how sustainable finance will affect environmental outcomes.",2020,2020-05-01,1,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Environmental politics; Political science; Participant observation; Mainstream; Climate Finance; Persuasion; International political economy; Sustainability,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/149642/,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/149642/ https://research-api.cbs.dk/ws/files/62141518/andreas_dimmelmeier_phd_series_19_2020.pdf https://research.cbs.dk/en/publications/the-role-of-economic-ideas-in-sustainable-finance-from-paradigms-,lens,000-429-364-445-716

This article reviews the direct (financial) and indirect (real) channels through which banks and sovereigns interact, and which can give rise to feedback loops between them. While significant progress has been achieved in recent years in mitigating the direct channel, its indirect mechanisms have remained largely intact. Policy options for improving the financial stability of euro area banks and sovereigns continue to be discussed in policy circles, including measures to diversify banks sovereign debt holdings. While a review of the literature and model-based simulations do not demonstrate that diversification in itself has a clear impact on systemic risk, where it does reduce (or at least cap) total risks it can help significantly in absorbing shocks in crisis periods. Similarly, simulations show that greater cross-border integration in banking can dilute the impact of asymmetric shocks across regions in a monetary union.",2020,2020-04-03,0,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Nexus (standard); Communication channel; Economics; Diversification (finance); Sovereignty; Financial stability; Sovereign debt; European debt crisis,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eufqreuro/0191-03.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eufqreuro/0191-03.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/euf/qreuro/0191-03.html,lens,010-074-300-532-442

"Ramanathan, D.; Berkowitz, M.J.; Davis, A.; Pinney, S.J.; Miniaci-Coxhead, S.L.",Vitamindeficiency and outcomes after ankle fusion,"Category: Ankle Arthritis Ankle Basic Sciences Biologics Hindfoot Purpose: Ankle fusions are associated with a complication profile including nonunion with associated poor functional outcomes, chronic pain, and need for reoperation. Local risk factors (bone and soft-tissue loss, infection, ankle and hindfoot deformity, and neuropathy) and systemic risk factors (advanced age, smoking, alcohol abuse, worker’s compensation, noncompliance, obesity, and systemic comorbidities such as diabetes and immunodeficiency) have been shown to be associated with the development of a nonunion following fusion procedures. Vitaminhas an important role in bone healing, and vitamindeficiency has been proposed as a potential risk factor for the development of non-unions. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of low vitaminlevels on reoperation rates and the development of nonunions following ankle fusion surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all ankle fusions performed at a major health system from January 2010 to July 2019 was performed. In total, 240 ankle fusions were performed by seven surgeons. All patients who underwent primary fusion procedures were eligible for inclusion in this study. Exclusion criteria included: age less than 18 years revision surgery ankle fusion with the use of bulk allograft ankle fusion performed as part of an oncologic reconstruction and an absence of recorded vitaminlevels with 12 months of surgery. In total, 47 patients met inclusion criteria and formed the study group. In this group, 29 47 (61.7%) were female and 18 47 (38.3%) were male. Average age was 57.0 12.3 years (range: 18.6 to 75.7). Patients were grouped according to their vitaminlevels as being deficientlt 31 ng ml) or normal (31-80 ng ml).Prevalence of vitamindeficiency was 36.2% (17 47) at average of 35.7 ng ml. In vitamindeficient subgroup (n 17), average vitaminlevel was 16.9 ng ml. In normal vitaminsubgroup (n 30), average vitaminwas 46.4 ng ml. Overall, reoperation rate was 21.3% (10 47). Reoperation rate was 35.3% (6 17) in vitamindeficiency subgroup compared with 13.3% (4 30) reoperation rate in normal vitaminsubgroup (p lt 0.05). In vitamindeficient subgroup,procedures for nonunion included: dynamization (n 1), revision fusion (n 1), staged revision (n 2) and amputation (n 1) due to infected nonunion. There was also a symptomatic hardware removal. In normal vitaminsubgroup, reoperation indications included: malunion (n 1), elective dynamization before weightbearing (n 1), and symptomatic hardware removal (n 2). Normal vitaminsubgroup had zero nonunions. Conclusion: In patients undergoing ankle fusion, vitamindeficiencylt 31 ng ml) was associated with a reoperation rate over double that of patients with normal vitaminlevels. In the vitamindeficient subgroup, nearly all reoperations were for nonunion as compared to zero nonunion incidence in those with normal vitaminlevels. These suggest routine preoperative screening of vitaminlevel is indicated as a key component of ankle fusion care.

"Sakurai, Y.; Kurosaki, T.",A simulation analysis of systemic counterparty risk in over-the-counter derivatives markets,"In this paper, we propose a simulation framework to assess systemic risk in over-the-counter derivatives markets. We incorporate credit valuation adjustment (CVA), a mark-to-market estimate of counterparty credit risk booked on a bank’s balance sheet, into an otherwise standard structural model of credit risk. In this model, banks optimally hedge CVA by trading a credit default swap (CDS). The model aims to capture a possible adverse effect called CDS CVA feedback loop from CVA hedging, which could increase CDS spreads due to a lack of liquidity in CDS markets and even further increase CVA because CVA is valued using the default probability extracted from CDS spreads. In order to measure systemic counterparty credit risk, we aggregate CVA across banks and examine how the distribution of systemic counterparty credit risk changes depending on underlying model parameters. We document that the tail risk of CVA increases nonlinearly when the liquidity of CDS markets declines. As an extension, we also model cost of posting collateral and discuss the trade-off between reducing systemic counterparty credit risk, stability of CDS markets and collateral cost.",2019,2019-08-26,2,Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination,,Collateral management; Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Tail risk; Credit default swap; Monetary economics; Credit valuation adjustment; Derivatives market,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11403-019-00260-7,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:jeicoo:v:15:y:2020:i:1:d:10.1007_s11403-019-00260-7 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11403-019-00260-7 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jeicoo/v15y2020i1d10.1007_s11403-019-00260-7.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11403-019-00260-7,lens,008-811-693-519-446

This paper uses household survey data to analyze both macroeconomic and finanical stability risks from the rapidly rising household debt in China. We find that rising household indebtedness could boost consumption in the short term, while reducing it in the medium-to-long term. By stress testing households’ debt repayment capacity, we find that low-income households are most vulnerable to adverse income shocks which could lead to signficant defaults. Containing these risks would call for a strengthening of systemic risk assessment and macroprudential policies of the household sector.

"Karminsky, A.M.; Seryakova, E.V.",Assessment of cross-border transmission of systemic financial risk in EU countries,"Amid global financial instability timely identification and propagation of systemic risks within both national and international banking systems becomes essential. It implies that it is highly important to assess not only inner factors of systemic banking risk and channels of its propagation, but also external sources which are due to cross-boarder spread of systemic banking risks. This article focuses on researching cross-boarder mechanism of systemic risks spread using method of decomposition of the variance of errors of VAR-models basing on monthly aggregated country-level indices of financial stress for EU-countries (CLIFS: Country-Level Index of Financial Stress). This investigation seems to be acute for coordinating macroprudential policies of national regulators of EU- countries and mastering macroprudential policy of Bank of Russia due to high globalization of financial markets of EU-countries and growth of financial innovations. The matrix of connectedness of 27 countries belonging to EU allows to obtain index of systemic connectedness (84 %), which reflects high dependence of each country on external shocks transferred from other countries-members of EU. Indices of net connectedness allow to divide countries into two groups: net-acceptors and net-donors of systemic risks. Empirical analysis has confirmed the hypothesis that countries subject more to inner shocks Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Croatia-have really survived starting from 2008 banking crises, explained with internal imbalances of banking systems.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Financial Journal,,Variance (land use); Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Social connectedness; Globalization; Index (economics); Eu countries; Financial system; Financial risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.31107/2075-1990-2019-5-119-129,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fru/finjrn/190509p119-129.html,lens,001-661-639-247-982
"Souza, S.R.S.d.; Almeida, T.C.S.C.E.d.; Almeida, C.E.d.",Bailing in banks: costs and benefits,"We investigate the effectiveness of bail-in mechanisms in mitigating systemic risk and welfare costs to society during resolution processes. To perform this study, we define a network model of mutually exposed banks and use it to simulate the effects of shocks to these banks using granular data of the Brazilian banking system, its interbank exposures and credit register operations. In the simulations, we compare the outcomes of these initial shocks after resolution processes with and without bail-ins. The simulations show that by avoiding the liquidation of banks and the resulting interruption in their credit provision, bail-ins would be effective in preventing the amplification of losses imposed on the real sector. Analyzing the effects that the liquidation of Brazilian Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) would cause to credit provision to economic sectors, we find bailing in these banks would produce a relevant decrease in credit crunches. However, in our sample, only a few banks could benefit from bail-ins due to insufficiency of bail-inable instruments. To tackle this issue, we carry out a study based on counterfactual simulations to assess if and how setting requirements for bail-inable instruments would affect the likelihood of a successful bail-in. We find the number of small and medium banks that could benefit from a bail-in would grow substantially for small increases in these requirements.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Welfare; Counterfactual thinking; Cost–benefit analysis; Business; Systemic risk; Economic sector; Carry (investment); Sample (statistics); Monetary economics,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcb/wpaper/504.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcb/wpaper/504.html,lens,006-119-977-706-83X

"Nguyen, H.",Bayesian inference for high dimensional factor copula models,"Copulas have been applied to many research areas as multivariate probability distributions for non-linear dependence structures. However, extending copula functions in high dimensions is challenging due to the increase of model parameters and computational intensity. Fortunately, in many circumstances, high dimensional dependence can be explained by a few common factors. This dissertation focuses on using factor copula models to analyze the high dimensional dependence structure of random variables. Different factor copula models are proposed as a solution for the curse of dimensionality. Then, a parallel Bayesian inference or a Variational Inference (VI) is employed to speed up the computation time. Chapterconcentrates on a dynamic one factor model for group generalized hyperbolic skew Student-t copulas. Chapterandextend the multi-factor copula models to suit with different high dimensional data sets. These models have applications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as financial stock returns, spatial time series, and economic time series, among others. Chapterdevelops a class of dynamic one factor copula models for tackling the curse of dimensionality. The asymmetric dependence is taken into account by group generalized hyperbolic skew Student-t copulas. The study is influenced by Creal and Tsay (2015), Oh and Patton 1(2017), but instead, the dynamic factor loading equation follows a generalized autoregresive score process which depends on the copula density conditional on the factor rather than the unconditional copula density, as proposed in Oh and Patton (2017). As the conditional posterior distributions of parameters in groups can be inferred independently due to model specifications, a parallel Bayesian inference is employed. This reduces the time of computation for a sizable problem from several days to one hour using a personal computer. The model is illustrated for 140 firms listed in theP500 index and the optimal portfolio allocation is obtanied based on minimum Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). The major content of this chapter resulted into a paper by Nguyen et al. (2019) which had been accepted for publication in Journal of Financial Econometrics. Chaptertakes advantage of the static structured factor copula models proposed by Krupskii and Joe (2015) for the dependence of homogenerous variables in different groups. To extend one factor copula models, Krupskii and Joe (2015) assume a hierarchical structure for the latent factors and model the dependence of the observables through a serial of bivariate copula links between the observables and the latent variables. This topology stems from vine copulas and becomes very flexible to capture both asymmetric tail dependence as well as correlation among variables. The VI is used to estimate the different specifications of structured factor copula models. VI aims to approximate the joint posterior distribution of model parameters by a simpler distribution which resuls in a very fast inference algorithm in comparison to the MCMC approach. Secondly, an automated procedure is proposed to recover the dependence linkages. By taking advantage of the posterior modes of the latent variables, the initial assumptions of bivariate copula functions are inspected and replaced for better copula functions based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Chaptershows an empirical example where the structured factor copula models help to predict the missing temperatures of 24 locations among 479 stations in Germany. The major content of this chapter resulted into a working paper by Nguyen et al. (2018). Chaptersupplements the factor copula model with a combination of a factor copula model at the first tree level and a truncated vine copula structure at a higher tree level. The model is not only suitable to capture different behaviors at the tail of the distribution but also remains parsimonious with interpretable economic meanings. The truncated factor vine copula models can outperform the multi-factor copula model in cases that there is weak dependence among variables in higher tree levels and the inference of group latent factors becomes inaccurate. The VI strategy is used and the dependence structure can be recovered with a similar copula selection procedure. Chaptercompares the statistical criteria of different factor models for the dependence structure of stock returns from 218 companies listed in 10 different European countries. References D. D.

"Kapsis, I.",Blockchain and cryptocurrencies: essential tools in a two-tier financial system,"Yes This article discusses the current situation in the market of cryptocurrencies and joins the debate about the regulation of these financial innovations. It argues that the appearance of cryptocurrencies was a response to market demand for more affordable and more inclusive banking. It also argues that distributed ledger technology (DLT) which supports cryptocurrencies and has different characteristics than the technology used by traditional banking could help to create with cryptocurrencies a new, lower cost, more inclusive financial ecosystem separate from the traditional one. The two ecosystems (traditional and new one) would form a larger two-tier financial ecosystem, which, overall would be more inclusive and more affordable. Also, it would be more effective in containing contagion and major economic disruption during future financial crises. The current reliance on a single, ever growing, and immensely complex financial ecosystem is not sustainable longer term as systemic risks grow with the system and there are no mechanisms available to fully eliminate these risks. The costs of regulating the current market architecture are also excessively high.The full-text of this article will be released for public view at the end of the publisher embargo on 12 Dec 2021",2019,2019-12-11,1,Capital Markets Law Journal,,Business; Cryptocurrency; Blockchain; Computer security,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cmlj/kmz025,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupcmljnl/v_3a15_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a18-47..htm https://academic.oup.com/cmlj/article/15/1/18/5673464,lens,001-404-510-465-009

"Kovalenko, V.; Kuznetsova, L.; Sergeeva, E.; Todorova, N.; Mylashko, O.; Tej, J.",Cluster approach to banking supervision with reference to bank risk profile,"result of the global financial crisis is the process of transformation of banking supervision aimed at increasing the efficiency of banking risk management and improving mechanisms for dealing with various risk factors. The transformation of the banking surveillance system in the global aspect has defined a set of measures which are constantly monitored by international regulators. The improvement the supervisory methodology is mainly governed by the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and currently involves of new standards and approaches to regulating and supervising banks based on risk diversification, development of regulations and prompt application of measures to influence banks activities in case of excessive risk build up and increasing threats to the realization of systemic risk, implementation of internal control recommendations at banks aimed at identifying and minimizing the aggregate level of their risk, improvement of analytical rules and procedures and agreeing on intra-bank risk assessment techniques. Purpose. This paper presents the of the possibility of using the cluster approach in the process of investigating the relationship between the ownership structure and risk profile of Ukrainian banks and, on this basis, improving their supervision. Methods. While assessing the financial condition of Ukrainian banks, the authors used statistical monitoring and cluster analysis. The of the study show that cluster analysis in banking supervision, depending on the ownership of banks, allows to determine the scale of the impact of crisis factors, identify the ways and methods of crisis management, as well as measures to overcome the future crisis with the least losses. It is proved that by means of cluster analysis, the regulator is able to group banks according to the similar business models and risk profiles. The criterion for including banks with different as to their size assets within a definite supervisory cluster is the same ownership structure. The analysis of 77 Ukrainian banks operating on theJanuary 2019 shows that, by the form of ownership, the banks of the 1st and 2nd groups can be distinguished as state-owned banks, large private banks and banks with foreign capital. By the character of operations they fall into risky (7 banks), schematic (4 banks), inactive (7 banks), captive (6 banks) and market banks (20 banks). The authors identify the groups of indicators that characterize bank risk profile, namely by counterparties, by instruments and by currencies. The study proposes an algorithm of bank clustering according to risk profile, which includes five stages: formation of data array, elimination of statistical units that generate extremes, normalization of the data array, analytical operations based on neural networks, formation of clusters and development of diversified modes of supervision. A strong correlation between the ownership structure and the risk profile in the Ukrainian banking system is proved. The analysis shows that ownership is not the only factor affecting a bank business model. Further stages of qualitative transformation of the banking supervision system in Ukraine should be aimed at specifying the regimes of control over the activities of financial intermediaries based on their risk profile according to the proposed methodology. . , , .

The multiplex graph model has two channels of contagion: a counterparty channel of contagion and a price channel of contagion through endogenous collateral price. Borrowers diversify their lenders because of the counterparty risk, but they have to deal with lenders who lend at a higher margin. This diversification generates positive externalities by reducing systemic risk, but any decentralized equilibrium is constrained inefficient due to under-diversification.

We study this problem by investigating a large proprietary dataset of payments among 2.4M Italian firms, whose credit risk rating is known. We document significant correlations between local topological properties of a node (firm) and its risk. Moreover we show the existence of an homophily of risk, i.e. the tendency of firms with similar risk profile to be statistically more connected among themselves. This effect is observed when considering both pairs of firms and communities or hierarchies identified in the network.

"Saad-Filho, A.",Crisis in neoliberalism or crisis of neoliberalism,"This rather perceptive assessment of the implications of the current crisis for the United Kingdom (and a good many other countries) is more candid and insightful than the twaddle of many mainstream journalists, economists and politicians, who proclaim the virtues of the free market’ while blaming an unholy coalition of unhinged bankers, shifty borrowers and incompetent regulators for the disaster. In order to save neoliberalism from itself, the free marketeers have nationalized some of the largest financial institutions in the world, socialized financial market risks and pumped huge amounts of public money into the economy. The rhetorical gyrations justifying this frenzy have been ideological in the worst possible sense: they are deliberately misleading representations of reality, concocted to confuse the audience and stultify the opposition. In contrast, Marxian assessments of the crisis, being grounded upon the realities of accumulation and located within systemic analyses of the class relations under neoliberalism, suggest that this is not a crisis of (de)regulation but, instead, a systemic crisis in neoliberal capitalism. It is not, yet, a crisis of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is the mode of existence of contemporary capitalism. This system of accumulation emerged gradually, since the mid-1970s, in response to the transformation of the conditions of accumulation accompanying the disarticulation of the Keynesian-social democratic consensus, the paralysis of developmentalism and the implosion of the Soviet bloc. In essence, neoliberalism is based on the systematic use of state power, under the ideological guise of non-intervention’, to impose a hegemonic project of recomposition of the rule of capital at five levels: domestic resource allocation, international economic integration, the reproduction of the state, ideology, and the reproduction of the working class. These are summarily described below in order to locate the contradictions leading to the current crisis. Even before the current crisis, the notion that finance mobilises and allocates resources efficiently, drastically reduces systemic risks and brings significant productivity gains for the economy as a whole was untenable. Not only did the expected acceleration of growth through financial and capital account liberalization fail to materialise in most countries but, instead, finance-induced crises have become more frequent. Conversely, the growth accelerations in the age of neoliberalism have been largely unrelated either to changes in financial sector regulations or capital account liberalization. An alternative interpretation is more plausible: regardless of these limitations, financialization plays a pivotal role in contemporary capitalism because it supports the transnationalization of production, facilitates the concentration of income and wealth and supports the political hegemony of neoliberalism through continuing threats of capital flight. The power of finance has become especially evident during the current crisis, when several governments were compelled to rescue large institutions and, in some cases, entire financial systems at huge cost to the public. Even more strikingly, these revived institutions immediately started demanding budget cuts because of the alleged unsustainability’ of the fiscal position of states that, nominally, own’ some of the largest banks in the land. Never in economic history has so much trouble and expense been rewarded with such effrontery.",2019,2019-01-25,12,"Value and Crisis: Essays on Labour, Money and Contemporary Capitalism",,Neoliberalism; Systemic risk; Economics; Free market; Capital flight; Reproduction (economics); Financialization; Market economy; Capitalism; Capital (economics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004393202_017,https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/14338 https://brill.com/view/book/9789004393202/BP000018.xml?language=en https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/download/14338/11381,lens,002-719-277-609-354
"McEvoy, T.R.; Kowalski, S.",Deriving cyber security risks from human and organizational factors A socio-technical approach,"Cyber security risks are socio-technical in nature. They result not just from technical vulnerabilities but also, more fundamentally, from the degradation of working practices over time which move an organization across the boundary of secure practice to a place where attacks will not only succeed, but also have a significantly greater impact on the organization. Yet current risk analysis and management methodologies are not designed to detect these kinds of systemic risks.

Regulation aims at correcting information asymmetry, maintaining trust in the financial system and avoiding systemic risk, or contagion, all which are considered public goods. The chapter also discusses regulatory capture and how decentralising regulatory power and can prevent capture. The chapter argues that from an economic point of view, regulation is a cost. As such that market players always undertake a cost-benefit analysis in their adherence to regulation. The chapter also analyses the concept of the regulatory space and argues that within this space, there is always an ongoing contestation for advantage.

"Khan, U.",Does fair value accounting contribute to systemic risk in the banking industry,"investigate whether fair value accounting can contribute to the banking industry's systemic risk.focus on the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 (SFAS No. 115), which required available for sale (AFS) securities to be recognized at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 115 increased banks' regulatory risk because, at the time, calculation of regulatory capital closely conformed with GAAP equity.find that systemic risk increased following the adoption of SFAS No. 115. Furthermore, following a subsequent regulatory amendment which excluded unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities from regulatory capital but did not change their GAAP treatment systemic risk decreased. Taken together, the evidence suggests that fair value accounting has the potential to increase systemic risk through the explicit inclusion of volatile fair value estimates in regulatory bank capital adequacy assessments.do not, however, find evidence of fair value accounting impacting systemic risk in its information role that is, by providing information to a bank's external stakeholders about its financial position and performance.also show that higher fair value volatility of investment securities, lower bank capital, and larger AFS security holdings increase banks' marginal contribution to systemic risk. My findings should interest regulators and policymakers, as recent regulatory changes in light of Basel III recommendations require unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities to be included in regulatory capital for advanced approaches banks. La comptabilite a la juste valeur contribueelle au risque systemique dans le secteur bancaire L'auteur se demande si la comptabilite a la juste valeur peut contribuer au risque systemique dans le secteur bancaire. Il s'interesse plus particulierement a l'adoption de la norme SFAS115 exigeant que les titres disponibles a la vente soient comptabilises a leur juste valeur, les profits et pertes latents etant inclus dans les capitaux propres par l'intermediaire du cumul des autres elements du resultat global (AERG). La norme115 a augmente le risque lie a la reglementation auquel sont exposees les banques du fait qu’a l’epoque, le calcul du capital reglementaire s'apparentait de pres a celui des capitaux propres selon les PCGR. L'auteur constate que le risque systemique a augmente a la suite de l'adoption de la norme SFAS115. Il a par ailleurs diminue apres une modification reglementaire subsequente selon laquelle les gains et pertes latents afferents aux titres disponibles a la vente ont ete exclus du capital reglementaire tout en demeurant assujettis au meme traitement en vertu des PCGR. Dans leur ensemble, ces constatations semblent indiquer que la comptabilite a la juste valeur a le potentiel d'accroitre le risque systemique par suite de l'integration explicite d'estimations a la juste valeur volatiles dans les evaluations reglementaires du caractere adequat du capital bancaire. L'auteur ne releve cependant rien qui permette d'affirmer que la comptabilite a la juste valeur ait une incidence sur le risque systemique dans son role informatif, soit celui de fournir aux parties prenantes externes d'une banque de l'information au sujet de la situation et de la performance financieres de cette derniere. Il montre en outre qu'une plus grande volatilite de la juste valeur des titres de placement, un capital bancaire moins eleve et la detention d'un plus grand volume de titres disponibles a la vente accroissent la contribution marginale des banques au risque systemique. Les observations de l'auteur devraient interesser les autorites de reglementation et les responsables de l’elaboration des politiques, puisque les modifications recemment apportees a la reglementation dans la foulee des recommandations dele III exigent que les gains et pertes latents afferents aux titres disponibles a la vente soient inclus dans le capital reglementaire des banques utilisant les approches avancees.",2019,2019-08-21,17,Contemporary Accounting Research,,Systemic risk; Economics; Banking industry; Welfare economics; Fair value,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12501,https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4798/fair%20value%20accounting.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/coacre/v36y2019i4p2588-2609.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1911-3846.12501 https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/financialstudies/files/files/fair%20value%20accounting.pdf http://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/financialstudies/files/files/fair%20value%20accounting.pdf,lens,000-193-813-128-620
"Ararat, Ç.; Rudloff, B.",Dual representations for systemic risk measures,"The financial crisis showed the importance of measuring, allocating and regulating systemic risk. Recently, the systemic risk measures that can be decomposed into an aggregation function and a scalar measure of risk, received a lot of attention. In this framework, capital allocations are added after aggregation and can represent bailout costs. More recently, a framework has been introduced, where institutions are supplied with capital allocations before aggregation. This yields an interpretation that is particularly useful for regulatory purposes. In each framework, the set of all feasible capital allocations leads to a multivariate risk measure. In this paper, we present dual representations for scalar systemic risk measures as well as for the corresponding multivariate risk measures concerning capital allocations. Our cover both frameworks: aggregating after allocating and allocating after aggregation. As examples, we consider the aggregation mechanisms of the Eisenberg Noe model as well as those of the resource allocation and network flow models.",2019,2019-11-05,23,Mathematics and Financial Economics,,Flow network; Systemic risk; Dual (category theory); Microeconomics; Bailout; Risk measure; Resource allocation; Computer science; Capital (economics); Mathematical finance; Actuarial science; Economics; Function (engineering),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11579-019-00249-7,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11579-019-00249-7 http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/handle/11693/53450 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160703430A/abstract http://dspace.bilkent.edu.tr/handle/11693/53450 http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/11693/53450/1/Dual_representations_for_systemic_risk_measures.pdf http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03430,lens,006-320-797-383-302

In line with previous studies, we find that large, market-oriented banks were particularly hit by the 2007 2009 global financial crisis, whereas smaller, retail-oriented banks weathered these years relatively well. In subsequent years, however, the picture reversed and retail-oriented banks were most affected. Over the entire period, medium-sized banks suffered most losses and often needed state aid. This suggests that measures to contain systemic risk, such as capital surcharges and bail-in requirements, are not only relevant for the largest banks but also for smaller institutions.",2019,2019-07-02,9,Journal of Banking Regulation,,Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Twin crises; Business model; Stock (geology); Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41261-019-00107-y,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41261-019-00107-y https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jbkreg/v21y2020i3d10.1057_s41261-019-00107-y.html,lens,005-056-407-548-479
"Ragnarsson, Ö.P.; Hannesson, J.M.; Hreinsson, L.",Financial cycles as early warning indicatorslessons from the nordic region,"Frameworks to handle cyclical systemic risk usually contain a wide selection of early warning indicators. Different indicators sometimes send diverging signals which can be hard to interpret. However, measures of aggregate financial cycles can serve as a way to synthesize information from many indicators. There are however many ways to construct a measure of such cycles. Many methods exist for cycle extraction, variable choice represents another dimension, and cycle aggregation the third. We tackle each step of the way by selecting the best out of six cycle extraction methods, then comparing variables from three groups: credit, house prices and bank funding, and lastly arguing for a simple method of cycle aggregation based on cycle correlation and frequency domain analysis. We then construct a trivariate financial cycle measure which outperforms the ’Basel gap’, all univariate cycles and all other multivariate combinations for the Nordic countries in terms of a noise-to-signal ratio. In addition, it peaks much closer to crisis onset and does relatively well at real-time turning point identification. The trivariate band-pass filtered measure contains the best variable from each group, and outperforms them all. This indicates that aggregate cycles can be more than the sum of their parts, as early warning indicators. Furthermore, we examine potential weaknesses of our analysis in terms of small-sample problems, spurious cycles and the timing of crisis onset. We conclude with 15 lessons from the Nordic countries.",2019,2019-01-01,0,,,Finance; Systemic risk; Variable (computer science); Univariate; Dimension (data warehouse); Aggregate (data warehouse); Warning system; Computer science; Identification (information); Spurious relationship,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ice/wpaper/wp80.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ice/wpaper/wp80.html,lens,009-701-577-684-398
"Fissler, T.; Hlavinová, J.; Rudloff, B.",Forecast evaluation of set-valued functionals,"A functional is elicitable (identifiable) if it is the unique minimiser (zero) of an expected scoring function (identification function). Elicitability and identifiability are essential for forecast ranking and validation, $M$- and $Z$-estimation, both possibly in a regression framework. To account for the set-valued nature of many interesting functionals such as quantiles, systemic risk measures or prediction intervals we introduce a theoretical framework of elicitability and identifiability of set-valued functionals. It distinguishes between exhaustive forecasts, being set-valued and aiming at correctly specifying the entire functional, and selective forecasts, content with solely specifying a single point in the correct functional. Uncovering the structural relation between the two corresponding notions of elicitability and identifiability, we establish that a set-valued functional can be either selectively elicitable or exhaustively elicitable. Notably, selections of quantiles such as the lower quantile turn out not to be elicitable in general. Applying these structural to Vorob'ev quantiles of random sets, we establish their selective identifiability and exhaustive elicitability. In particular, we provide a mixture representation of elementary scores, leading the way to Murphy diagrams.

The proposed measure of systemic risk considers the score of the conditional density as the main driver of time-varying dynamics of tail dependence among financial institutions. Not only does the GAS Copula-based CoVaR enable us to monitor the amount of systemic risk posed by different financial institutions at a specific date, it also allows for the forecasting of systemic risk over time. Our based on a sample of daily equity returns collected from January 2000 to July 2017 surprisingly show that in South Africa, insurers are the most systemically risky compared to banks and other financial sectors. Moreover, we make use of flexible GAS Copulas in order to approximate complex dependence structures. To validate the robustness of our over time, we divide our sample period into two sub samples, namely the pre-crisis period (January 2000 to June 2007) and the post-crisis period (January 2010 to July 2017).

When the hog supply chain node enterprises are subjected to external shocks, on the basis of the commercial credit relationship in the supply chain, the entire supply chain generates liquidity risks and systemic risks.

If the external shock is less than a certain value, the current profits of the hog enterprise can entirely make up for the loss caused by external shocks, and the production of the firm will return to its state of equilibrium. If the external shock is large enough, liquidity constraints will seriously restrict the production input of the enterprise, which then leads to a deceleration of production input and may ultimately result in bankruptcy.

It will be appropriate to build CCP system on a solid legal base in order to ensure that the financial markets are not adversely affected during periods of economic crisis, or to keep the losses at a minimum level. For this reason, it is important to determine the legal nature of the CCP membership agreement and the legal basis of the relationship of that agreement. In case of active use of the CCP system, both time and money will be saved for banks and investment institutions that are members of the system, and systemic risk can be prevented. In other words, lack of explicitly determining the clearing rules for the system can cause loss of time (especially when the case file is submitted to the experts, etc.) and loss of money (the need for expert opinion, etc.), especially if the matter is submitted to the judiciary. Thanks to an efficient CCP implementation, it is possible to control the counterparty credit risk by increasing the confidence in the markets and thus to decrease the systemic risk.

"Pizzutto, G.","Monetary policy, spread compression, and the housing market","In the period around the 1980s, the process of securitization of home mortgages transformed illiquid assets into liquid assets. The transfer of illiquid assets off the balance sheet reduced financing costs for the banking system and the amount of capital demanded by Basel I. The banking system and the Basel regulators believed that this process relocated risk outside of the banking system, which has always been considered a primary source of systemic risk. The securitization process is part of a market mechanism that strengthens the bond between the money market and the capital market while introducing elements of instability into the financial system. The securitization process involves many steps where financing of the money market continues to play an important role. From mortgage accumulation to the structuring of securitized assets and the sale of tranches to final investors, the dealers control the sequential intermediation process, extending their activity into a completely new market segment. The dealers had always been present in the primary and secondary markets where public and private stocks and bonds are traded. In the 1990s, securitized products entered the market, financed as always via the money market. At the beginning of this century, the Fed implemented a very expansionary monetary policy that reduced yields on all short- and long-term financial assets. Not only did interest rates fall under expansionary monetary policy, but risk premiums also tended to shrink significantly because of the increase in demand for high-risk financial assets. Financial intermediaries shifted to these assets, in part by increasing leverage, to obtain higher yields. The reduction in the spread also reduced volatility. On the other hand, when monetary policy becomes restrictive and interest rates begin to rise, the risk premium tends to rise and the profitability of the intermediation process declines.",2019,2019-04-03,0,Palgrave Studies in Economic History,,Monetary policy; Business; Systemic risk; Interest rate; Balance sheet; Market liquidity; Money market; Market mechanism; Monetary economics; Secondary market,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14489-0_7,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-14489-0_7,lens,001-523-446-864-313

Therefore, operational risks in project-based organizations are directly related to the project risk management.

We found that banks typically cleaned the larger problem exposures, and there is no indication that institutions gave preference in the cleaning process to problem exposures that defaulted more recently. In fact, when examining the institutions preliminarily affected by the announcement about the intended capital buffer quite the opposite was seen. The analysis also revealed that cleaning was stronger at those institutions which, based on the 2015 Q3 data, would have been preliminarily affected by the systemic risk buffer.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Financial and Economic Review,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Quarter (United States coin); Portfolio; Exposure database; Default; Non-performing loan; Real estate; Capital (economics),http://dx.doi.org/10.33893/fer.18.3.5282,https://ideas.repec.org/a/mnb/finrev/v18y2019i3p52-82.html https://en-hitelintezetiszemle.mnb.hu/letoltes/fer-18-3-st3-faykiss-rariga-zsigo.pdf,lens,007-591-416-985-272

The directed edge weight between any two nodes is calculated with use of the value of ΔCoVaR, one of the most popular systemic risk measures proposed by M. Brunnermeier and T. Adrian in 2011. The value of ΔCoVaR measures the relationship between any two assets and is based not only on the yields of the assets, but take into account the mutual effect of its performance. In contrast with correlation coefficient, ΔCoVaR is asymmetric. The analysis is focused on the static model of the ΔCoVaR estimation. Moreover, this paper uses statistical testing procedures to assess the significance of the findings and interpretations based on this co-risk measure. We examine the intrinsic properties and regularities of stock market analyzing the directed complex network with more than 3700 stocks as nodes which have been traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ in recent years. We connect any two stock with a directed edge if the value of the corresponding ΔCoVaR is statistically significant and its normalized value is greater than a given threshold.

It is concluded that the regional policy of import substitution is a separate integral direction of the state policy, which is implemented with the purpose of overcoming systemic risks and threats of import dependence of the interregional and local markets, and is implemented using a set of mechanisms, tools and measures available, most acceptable and effective at the regional level. A significant role is assigned to the generalization of the world experience of the state regulation of import substitution this is especially important in the context of the formation and implementation of state policy in Ukraine in this area. The of the analysis confirm the high level of import dependence of Ukraine’s domestic market and pronounced trends towards increasing dependence and growing threats to the economic security of the state. Assessments are made and features of import dependence by regions are identified this shows excessive territorial-spatial differentiation and high criticality of the scale and trends of intra-regional consumption of imported goods in Ukraine. A high level of import dependence is inherent in all regions of the state, since the share of imports in domestic consumption has exceeded the critical value in 13 regions and the average share over the country in six regions. The share of imports in domestic consumption was within the optimal value in three regions only. The systemic nature of the problem of import substitution involves the need to strategize the state policy in this area, in particular, taking into account regional peculiarities.

Penetrating keratoplasty was performed using similar technique and patients were followed up till a period ofyear and post operative complications were identified and managed accordingly. The outcome was assessed in terms of percentage improvement in logMAR visual acuity and the variables affecting the final visual outcome were studied. Of the total 50 cases of penetrating keratoplasty that were analyzed 33 were done for therapeutic purposes and 17 were done for optical reasons. Mean recipient age was 39.88 years 2.9 years, range 3-68. Follow up period wasyear. The indications were therapeutic (34%), post traumatic or post infective corneal scarring (50%), previous graft failure (6%) and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (4%). In optical PK, 62.5% recipient eyes showed good visual improvement (improvement of more than -0.8 log MAR). 21.8% eyes showed moderate visual improvement, and 15.6% eyes showed no visual improvement. In eyes with therapeutic PK, 46.7% showed good visual improvement, 13.3% moderate and 40% showed no visual improvement. Conclusion: Penetrating keratoplasty done for both optical and therapeutic indications resulted in fairly good visual outcome. The pre-operative host risk factors were associated with an increased probability of graft rejection. Careful workup of recipients for corneal transplantation with reference to local and systemic risk factors is of utmost importance in the outcome of corneal transplantation with regards to graft survival.

"Středová, M.; Hejsek, L.; Nekolová, J.; N, J.","Suprachoroideal haemorrhage in postoperative period of antiglaucoma surgery, case report","Suprachoroidal haemorrhage (SCH) is a serious complication of intraocular procedures. Physiologically there is only a minimal amount of fluid in the suprachoroid space, pathologically the fluid volume increases, which causes ablation of the choroid. SCH could be divided into different cathegories, according to the character of the fluid into serous and haemorrhagic by the time of occurrence in relation to the surgery into peroperative and postoperative. Diagnosis is based on biomicroscopic and ultrasound examinations. The ocular risk factors for SCH are glaucoma, myopia and aphakia systemic risk factors include vascular fragility, arterial hypertension and blood coagulation disorders. In the pathogenesis hypotonia of the eye, that causes rupture of the ciliary vessels, plays a very important role. SCH can be treated both conservatively and surgically. As to pharmacotherapy we use gabapentin to suppress neuropathic pain and prednisone, topical mydriatics and anti-inflammatory agents. The type of surgical treatment differs according to time of occurrence, if SCH occurs during the operation, the intervention consists mainly in the wound closure and the repositioning of the weakening tissues in postoperative forms, we choose drainage procedures, possibly vitreoretinal procedures. Our patient, an 80-year-old myop and chronic glaucomatic treated intensively both topically and systematically underwent trabeculectomy on his left eye due to unsatisfactory intraocular pressure (IOP) and significant glaucoma progression. The surgical intervention went without any complications. In the early post-operative period, there was persisting elevation of IOP, therefore sclera lap was discontinued and 5-fluorouracil was applied under the filter blister. Subsequent hypotonia caused a hemorrhagic SCH with intraocular hypertension, which was resolved by draining the blood with sclerotomias and thus releasing intraocular hypertension. The visual acuity of the left eye gradually improved to almost original values. Intraocular pressure, however, is not well compensated despite many following antiglaucoma surgeries. Therefore, even with the patients maximum therapy, glaucoma continues to progress. In our case, we confirm that it is possible to solve even the relatively most complicated cases of SCH. We stress the necessity to consider the presence of risk factors of the occurrence of SCH before indicating intraocular procedures and also recommend thinking carefully about other less invasive surgical techniques. In glaucoma, it is appropriate taking in account the prediction of life compared to the expected rate of progression of vision loss.",2019,2019-02-21,1,Ceska a Slovenska Oftalmologie : Casopis Ceske Oftalmologicke Spolecnosti a Slovenske Oftalmologicke Spolecnosti,"aged, 80 and over; choroid hemorrhage/etiology; filtering surgery; glaucoma; glaucoma/surgery; humans; intraocular pressure; postoperative complications; suprachoroidal haemorrhage; tonometry, ocular; trabeculectomy; trabeculectomy/adverse effects; treatment outcome",Surgery; Choroid; Sclera; Aphakia; Trabeculectomy; Visual acuity; Glaucoma; Intraocular pressure; Medicine; Complication,http://dx.doi.org/10.31348/2019/2/6,http://dx.doi.org/10.31348/2019/2/6 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31537078 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537078,lens,006-810-835-053-956
"Sun, L.",Systemic risk and heterogeneous mean field type interbank network,"We study the system of heterogeneous interbank lending and borrowing based on the relative average of log-capitalization given by the linear combination of the average within groups and the ensemble average and describe the evolution of log-capitalization by a system of coupled diffusions. The model incorporates a game feature with homogeneity within groups and heterogeneity between groups where banks search for the optimal lending or borrowing strategies through minimizing the heterogeneous linear quadratic costs in order to avoid to approach the default barrier. Due to the complicity of the lending and borrowing system, the closed-loop Nash equilibria and the open-loop Nash equilibria are both driven by the coupled Riccati equations. The existence of the equilibria in the two-group case where the number of banks are sufficiently large is guaranteed by the solvability for the coupled Riccati equations as the number of banks goes to infinity in each group. The equilibria are consisted of the mean-reverting term identical to the one group game and the group average owing to heterogeneity. In addition, the corresponding heterogeneous mean filed game with the arbitrary number of groups is also discussed. The existence of theepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in the general $d$ heterogeneous groups is also verified. Finally, in the financial implication, we observe the Nash equilibria governed by the mean-reverting term and the linear combination of the ensemble averages of individual groups and study the influence of the relative parameters on the liquidity rate through the numerical analysis.",2019,2019-07-06,1,Arxiv: Mathematical Finance,,Order (group theory); Interbank lending market; Interbank network; Applied mathematics; Mathematics; Nash equilibrium; Numerical analysis; Term (time); Linear combination; Group (mathematics),https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190703082S/abstract,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190703082S/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03082.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03082,lens,000-148-417-221-951

"Kim, H.H.; Jung, H.",Systemic risk of the consumer credit network across financial institutions,"We investigate a network of financial institutions in Korea using the Korea Consumer Credit Panel (KCCP). The main contribution of this paper is that we construct the network of financial institution from the consumer credit level. We assume each consumer make a loan from multiple institutions so that those institutions share same risk from same consumer no matter of quality or type of loan. Then we construct the financial network between institutions and compute contagion index based on those multiple connection with a weight of default probability of individual borrowers. We found strong connection with banking institutions and credit card firms due to convenience in making small-amount loans with credit cards. However, when we give an weight with default probability to the linkage among institutions, connections of banking institution with savings bank, non-credit card finance corporation and merchant banking are stronger than others, while banking institution holds center position and has biggest amount of loans individually. Contagion index hit a peak in 2013Q1 and then fell rapidly, finally has been fluctuated in relatively low level from 2016 to 2017Q2.

"Kanas, A.; Zervopoulos, P.",Systemic risk-shifting ins commercial banking,"This paper puts forward the proposition that U.S. commercial banks use dividends as a mechanism to shift systemic risk to debt-holders and the deposit insurer. Using a mixed data sampling modeling approach, it is shown that monthly systemic risk factors are associated with a positive effect on future quarterly bank dividends indicating systemic risk-shifting. These factors include absorption (Kritzman et al. in MIT working paper, 2010), catfin (Allen et al. in Rev Financ Stud 25:3000 3036, 2012), covar (Adrian and Brunnermeier in CoVaR.

"Mitic, P.",Systemic shock propagation in a complex system,"We study the effects of delivering a shock to a complex system comprising componentsagents’) that interact in a pairwise fashion, independent of other parts of the system and with no central control. There are three aspects to the contribution of this paper. First, shock propagation in a network is developed purely from fundamental principles of complex systems. Second, systemic risk is shown to arise naturally in such a complex system. If a shock is delivered either to one agent or to many agents simultaneously, that shock may be transmitted further, thereby resulting in systemic risk. Third, the monetary loss to the entire system as a result of systemic shock is quantified. Simulations are used to study two particular characteristics of the interactions. The first is the resistance or susceptibility of individual agents to a shock. The second is the time it takes for the shock to affect the entire system. The show that if a shock is applied to all agents in a network, the systemic effect of that shock is transmitted very quickly. Applying a shock to very few agents only in an idiosyncratic effect. If an agent can transmit the shock further, a systemic effect will result. The recovery period for agents affected by a systemic shock can be orders of magnitude greater than the time taken for the shock to take effect. The overall effect of the shock on the system is quantified by formulating a contagion index’, which measures the ratio of the total capital lost due to the systemic effect to the total capital before the shock was delivered. The result (approximately 7%) is consistent with other studies, but is more widely applicable because it is not based on one empirical data set.",2019,2019-11-18,1,Soft Computing,,Systemic risk; Orders of magnitude (time); Systemic shock; Set (psychology); Shock propagation; Computer science; Complex system; Control theory; Shock (mechanics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00500-019-04466-6,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10091501/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/soco/soco24.html#Mitic20 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00500-019-04466-6.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-019-04466-6,lens,010-473-437-471-52X

"Wentzel, J.J.","The role of shear stress in atherosclerotic plaque progression, destabilization and rupture","The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis is complex and multifactorial, involving systemic risk factors and biomechanical stimuli. Atherosclerotic plaques predominantly form in regions that are exposed to low shear stress of the blood at the vessel wall, whereas regions of moderate and high shear stress are generally protected. For more than 20 years, my research group performs studies to investigate the role of shear stress in atherosclerotic plaque formation and rupture in coronary and carotid arteries of patients and laboratory animals. For that reason, new technology was developed to 3D reconstruct arteries based on fusion of multiple invasive and non-invasive imaging modalities. These 3D reconstructions were used as input for computational fluid mechanics to derive the local shear stress. We noticed that if the lumen was not affected by the disease, because of outward remodeling, plaques were mainly located at low shear stress regions. However, at later stages of the disease if lumen narrowing occurred, the plaque is also exposed to high shear stress. Until now it is not fully clear, what the influence is of high shear stress on these advanced lumen intruding plaques. Evidence is accumulating for a role of high shear stress in changes in plaque composition towards plaque destabilization and eventually plaque rupture. Moreover, not much studies investigated the influence of multidirectional shear stress on plaque progression and destabilization. In this lecturewill present the research that my group performed to investigate the role of (multidirectional) shear stress on plaque progression, destabilization and rupture at different stages of the atherosclerotic disease.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Molecular & Cellular Biomechanics,,Lumen (unit); Pathology; Shear stress; Carotid arteries; Plaque rupture; Atherosclerotic disease; Plaque composition; Plaque progression; Medicine; Shear (geology),http://dx.doi.org/10.32604/mcb.2019.05696,http://tsp.techscience.com/uploads/attached/file/20190220/20190220105632_53099.pdf http://tspsubmission.com/index.php/mcb/article/view/5696,lens,009-367-076-212-244

"Kress, J.C.; Turk, M.C.",Too many to fail: against community bank deregulation,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and scholars have fixated on the problem of too-big-to-fail banks. This fixation, however, overlooks the historically dominant pattern in banking crises: the contemporaneous failure of many small institutions. We call this blind spot the too-many-to-fail problem and document how its neglect has skewed the past decade of financial regulation. In particular, we argue that, for so-called community banks, there has been a pronounced and unjustifiable shift toward deregulation, culminating in sweeping regulatory rollbacks in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. As this Article demonstrates, this deregulatory trend rests on three myths. First, that community banks do not contribute to systemic risk and were not central to the 2008 crisis. Second, that the Dodd-Frank Act imposed regulatory burdens that threaten the survival of the community bank sector. And third, that community banks cannot remain viable without special subsidies or regulatory advantages. While these claims have gained near-universal acceptance among legal scholars and policymakers, none of them withstands scrutiny. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, community banks were key participants in the 2008 crisis, were not uniquely burdened by post-crisis reforms, and continue to thrive economically. Dispelling these myths about the community bank sector leads to the conclusion that diligent oversight of community banks is necessary to preserve financial stability. Accordingly, this Article recommends a reversal of the community bank deregulatory trend and proposes affirmative reforms, including enhanced supervision and macro-prudential stress tests, that would help mitigate systemic risks in the community bank sector.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Economic policy; Business; Systemic risk; Consumer Protection Act; Conventional wisdom; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Financial regulation; Deregulation; Subsidy,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3503692,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3503692 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3503692,lens,000-491-120-827-15X

"Paulin, J.; Calinescu, A.; Wooldridge, M.",Understanding flash crash contagion and systemic risk: A micro macro agent-based approach,"The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the conditions that give rise to flash crash contagion, particularly with respect to overlapping asset portfolio crowding. To this end, we designed, implemented, and assessed a hybrid micro macro agent-based model, where price impact arises endogenously through the limit order placement activity of algorithmic traders. Our novel hybrid microscopic and macroscopic model allows us to characterise systemic risk not just in terms of system stability, but also in terms of the speed of financial distress propagation over intraday timescales. We find that systemic risk is strongly dependent on the behaviour of algorithmic traders, on leverage management practices, and on network topology. Our demonstrate that, for high-crowding regimes, contagion speed is a non-monotone function of portfolio diversification. We also find the surprising result that, in certain circumstances, increased portfolio crowding is beneficial to systemic stability. We are not aware of previous studies that have exhibited this phenomenon, and our establish the importance of considering non-uniform asset allocations in future studies.

"Petrone, D.; Latora, V.",A dynamic approach merging network theory and credit risk techniques to assess systemic risk in financial networks,"The interconnectedness of financial institutions affects instability and credit crises. To quantify systemic risk we introduce here the PD model, a dynamic model that combines credit risk techniques with a contagion mechanism on the network of exposures among banks. A potential loss distribution is obtained through a multi-period Monte Carlo simulation that considers the probability of default (PD) of the banks and their tendency of defaulting in the same time interval. A contagion process increases the PD of banks exposed toward distressed counterparties. The systemic risk is measured by statistics of the loss distribution, while the contribution of each node is quantified by the new measures PDRank and PDImpact. We illustrate how the model works on the network of the European Global Systemically Important Banks. For a certain range of the banks’ capital and of their assets volatility, our reveal the emergence of a strong contagion regime where lower default correlation between banks corresponds to higher losses. This is the opposite of the diversification benefits postulated by standard credit risk models used by banks and regulators who could therefore underestimate the capital needed to overcome a period of crisis, thereby contributing to the financial system instability.",2018,2018-04-03,22,Scientific Reports,,Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Diversification (finance); Financial networks; Probability of default; Monetary economics; Default; Volatility (finance); Interconnectedness,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23689-5,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/36340 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5883039 https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1610.00795/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018NatSR...8.5561P/abstract http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5883039 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23689-5 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23689-5.pdf,lens,004-093-399-990-115
"Pfeifer, L.; Hodula, M.",A profit-to-provisioning approach to setting the countercyclical capital buffer: the czech example,"Over the last few years, national macroprudential authorities have developed different strategies for setting the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate in the banking sector. The existing approaches are based on various indicators used to identify the current phase of the financial cycle. However, to our knowledge, there is no approach that directly takes into consideration banks’ prudential behavior over the financial cycle as well as cyclical risks in the banking sector. In this paper, we propose a new profit-to-provisioning approach that can be used in the macroprudential decision-making process. We construct a new set of indicators that largely capture the risk of cyclicality of profit and loan loss provisions. We argue that banks should conserve a portion of the cyclically overestimated profit (non-materialized expected loss) in their capital during a financial boom. We evaluate the performance of our newly proposed indicators using two econometric exercises. Overall, they exhibit good statistical properties, are relevant to the CCyB decision-making process, and may contribute to a more precise assessment of both systemic risk accumulation and risk materialization.

"Biondi, Y.","Banking, money and credit: A systemic perspective","Contemporaneous banking theories appear to understand financial institutions as intermediaries, relegating bank money creation through money multiplication outside the core of banking activity. This article takes a different systemic perspective, pointing to the dynamic and collective features that generate a banking system within and across financial institutions. Classic features such as bank credit creation, as well as classic issues such as bank runs, are reconsidered under the notion of a banking system’ requiring coordination over time and circumstances.Our conceptual framework develops a heuristic model of the basic mechanisms on which bank money creation lays upon. This model disentangles the link between functional and institutional dimensions of the money system, aiming to include minimal institutions in economic theory and economic analysis of money. These basic mechanisms include: monetary financial institutions (bank entities) issue claims which function as money they facilitate payments across agents in the economy over time and space they increase the money base through credit creation they hold fractional reserves and lend to each other. Ongoing bank activity involves cash and non-cash (accrual) processes occurring within each bank entity and across them. Each bank keeps currency money in bank deposits on behalf of other agents. But the bank activity is further characterised by the capacity or privilege to use these deposits, although the latter remain available for payment and redemption at will and at par. Moreover, the bank can create deposit by granting a loan to, or buy a security from a borrower. This bank capacity or privilege involves money generation that enables the bank credit manufacturing process. In this way, all the banks become interdependent on the flow of payments that are performed across them, generating the banking system’. Since each bank is structurally unbalanced due to money generation, inter-bank coordination is required to maintain the banking system in operation over time and circumstances. Both inter-bank clearing and credit arrangements provide this coordination at the inter-bank level, which is effectuated through central bank intervention, clearing houses and the money market.From this systemic perspective, systemic risk’ and macro-prudential’ management and regulation are new labels for recurrent concerns of systemic coordination. A careful combination of design and policy is therefore required to reach coordination in view to prevent or respond to local and systemic crises. Drawing upon this conceptual framework, this article develops institutional economic analysis and implications for shadow banking systemic risk, interdependency and interconnectedness the relationship between money and credit and the real economy and the systemic consistency between functions and institutions in monetary regimes.",2018,2018-07-05,18,"Accounting, Economics, and Law: a Convivium",,Demand deposit; Electronic money; Reserve requirement; Economics; Open market operation; Bank rate; Monetary reform; Monetary economics; Chinese financial system; Endogenous money,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ael-2017-0047,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ael-2017-0047/html https://basepub.dauphine.fr/handle/123456789/20426 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bpj:aelcon:v:8:y:2018:i:2:p:26:n:3 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/aelcon/v8y2018i2p26n3.html https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01880953,lens,009-779-808-078-767

The aim is to determine systemic banks, the main governance internal mechanisms and managers' entrenchment level that contributed to attenuating or amplifying individual and overall systemic risk. The empirical indicate that the internal governance mechanisms of banking institutions are positively associated with the long run marginal expected shortfall (LRMES), and that the presence of a risk management committee has no effect on the level of systemic risk incurred by banks.

The credit growth rate will be used as the dependent variable while the rate of the non-performing loans along with the growth rate of the deposit, the return of equity and the real growth rate of the gross domestic product will be used as independent variables.

The result of the regression analysis showed that there is a reverse relationship between the rate of the non-performing loans and the credit growth rate for all the observed countries. The high share of problematic loans in total loans relatively reflects in a negative way the overall tendency of the banks towards taking risks and credit growth. It reduces the profitability of the banking sector and increases the systemic risk as well. The basic of the regression analysis also showed a positive relationship between economic growth and the credit growth of banks. On the one hand, the economic growth of the region insufficiently follows the credit growth due to the stagnation of the real sector, and the recovery of the economy on the other hand. Similarly, there is a positive relationship between the growth rate of the deposits and credit growth, since the deposits sources are the basis for performing credit nomination.

"Karpman, K.; Basu, S.",DSMM SIGMODlearning financial networks using quantile granger causality,"In the post-crisis era, financial regulators and policymakers require data-driven tools to quantify systemic risk and to identify systemically important firms. We propose a statistical method that measures connectivity in the financial sector using time series of firms' stock returns. Our method is based on system-wide lower-tail analysis, whereby we estimate linkages between firms that occur when those firms are distressed and that exist conditional on the financial information of all other firms in the sample.

By considering centrality measures of the estimated networks, we can assess the build-up of systemic risk and identify risk propagation channels. We apply our method to monthly returns of large U.S. firms, demonstrating that we are able to detect many of the most recent systemic events, in addition to identifying key players in the 2007-2009 U.S. financial crisis.

"Passmore, W.; Hafften, A.H.v.","GSE guarantees, financial stability, and home equity accumulation","Before 2008, the government’s implicit guarantee of the securities issued by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led to practices by these institutions that threatened financial stability. In 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed these GSEs into conservatorship. Conservatorship was intended to be temporary but has now reached its tenth year, and policymakers continue to weigh options for reform. In this article, the authors assess both implicit and explicit government guarantees for the GSEs. They argue that adopting a legislatively defined explicit guarantee, as advocated by some, may be problematic for a variety of reasons, including the difficulty of pricing such a guarantee and the potential high cost for mortgage holders or the government. In addition to the creation of an explicit guarantee, they recommend that steps be taken to limit systemic risk in housing markets. To that end, they advocate the wider adoption of mortgages such as the Fixed-COFI mortgage that build homeowner equity faster than the thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage favored by the GSEs.

"Alla, Z.; Espinoza, R.A.; Li, Q.; Basurto, M.S.",Macroprudential stress tests: A reduced-form approach to quantifying systemic risk losses,"We present a novel approach that incorporates individual entity stress testing and losses from systemic risk effects (SE losses) into macroprudential stress testing. SE losses are measured using a reduced-form model to value financial entity assets, conditional on macroeconomic stress and the distress of other entities in the system. This valuation is made possible by a multivariate density which characterizes the asset values of the financial entities making up the system. In this paper this density is estimated using CIMDO, a statistical approach, which infers densities that are consistent with entities’ probabilities of default, which in this case are estimated using market-based data. Hence, SE losses capture the effects of interconnectedness structures that are consistent with markets’ perceptions of risk. We then show how SE losses can be decomposed into the likelihood of distress and the magnitude of losses, thereby quantifying the contribution of specific entities to systemic contagion. To illustrate the approach, we quantify SE losses due to Lehman Brothers’ default.",2018,2018-03-09,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Multivariate statistics; Economics; Valuation (finance); Asset (economics); Financial stability; Stress testing (software); Stress (mechanics); Interconnectedness,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/imfimfwpa/18_2f49.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/imfimfwpa/18_2f49.htm,lens,004-867-912-138-22X

"Füss, R.; Ruf, D.",Office market interconnectedness and systemic risk exposure,"We empirically examine how systemic risk in the banking sector leads to correlated risk in office markets of global financial centers. In so doing, we compute an aggregated measure of systemic risk in financial centers as the cumulated expected capital shortfall of local financial institutions. Our identification strategy is based on a double counterfactual approach by comparing normal with financial distress periods as well as office with retail markets. We find that office market interconnectedness arises from systemic risk during financial turmoil periods. Office market performance in a financial center is affected by returns of systemically linked financial center office markets only during a systemic banking crisis. In contrast, there is no evidence of correlated risk during normal times and among the within-city counterfactual retail sector. The decline in office market returns during a banking crisis is larger in financial centers compared to non-financial centers.",2018,2018-01-01,1,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Counterfactual thinking; Business; Systemic risk; Financial distress; Financial center; Banking sector; Financial system; Capital (economics); Interconnectedness; Spatial econometrics,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3188010,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3188010 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3188010,lens,007-264-695-202-77X

The decision of the treatment is a complex medical problem that includes the urgency, risk of thromboembolism, risk of bleeding, duration of bleeding and its possible control. The was to compare the immediate mediate postoperative Bleeding Index and the incidence of hematomas in surgery for the installation of dental implants in healthy patients vs. patients under chronic anticoagulation (with and without local hemostatic treatment). 10 healthy patients (G1: control) and 30 patients under chronic anticoagulation randomly distributed ingroups (n 10): under chronic anticoagulation with oral Tranexamic Acid (G2), under chronic anticoagulation treated locally with Bismuth Subgalate (G3), under chronic anticoagulation without any systemic or local hemostatic treatment (G4). All groups had indication of dental implant. The RIN (International Normalized Ratio) was measured (reference value determined from 2.5 to 3.5) in anti-coagulated patients prior to surgery. Two-time surgical implants (Q-Implantwere installed, 16 in G1, 14 in G2, 11 in G3 and 18 in G4. The following were recorded: bleeding index, presence of hematomas (external and internal), length of the incision, sutures and operative time. Patients were monitored from immediate postoperative to day 5. In case of bleeding, the Bleeding Index of Soarez et al.

"Kress, J.C.; McCoy, P.A.; Schwarcz, D.",Regulating entities and activities: complementary approaches to nonbank systemic risk,"The recent financial crisis demonstrated that, contrary to longstanding regulatory assumptions, nonbank financial firms such as investment banks and insurance companies can propagate systemic risk throughout the financial system. After the crisis, policymakers in the United States and abroad developed two different strategies for dealing with nonbank systemic risk. The first strategy seeks to regulate individual nonbank entities that officials designate as being potentially systemically important. The second approach targets financial activities that could create systemic risk, irrespective of the types of firms that engage in those transactions. In the last several years, domestic and international policymakers have come to view these two strategies as substitutes, largely abandoning entity-based designations in favor of activities-based approaches. This Article argues that this trend is deeply misguided because entity- and activities-based approaches are complementary tools that are each essential for effectively regulating nonbank systemic risk. Eliminating an entity-based approach to nonbank systemic risk either formally or through onerous procedural requirements would expose the financial system to the same risks that it experienced in 2008 as a result of distress at nonbanks like AIG, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers. This conclusion is especially salient in the United States, where jurisdictional fragmentation undermines the capacity of financial regulators to implement an effective activities-based approach. Significant reforms to the U.S. regulatory framework are necessary, therefore, before an activities-based approach can meaningfully complement domestic entity-based systemic risk regulation.",2018,2018-01-01,1,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Investment banking; Financial crisis; Financial stability; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3238059,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3238059 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3238059 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3238059 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3238059_code1460509.pdf?abstractid=3238059&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3504764_code1460509.pdf?abstractid=3238059&type=2,lens,001-936-651-286-466

Reasons for the over- or underestimation of risks, basic risk behavior (risk seeking versus risk avoiding personalities and strategies) as well as recommendations to overcome possible misperceptions will be forwarded. The actual problems of non-sustainable development in the world are partially due to ill-conceptualized and misleading indicators for risks.

Our systemic risk measure captures both the credit risk of an individual bank as well as a bank’s position in the network. We construct linkages between all U.S. commercial banks in 1929 and 1934 so that we can measure how predisposed the entire network was to risk, where risk was concentrated, and how the failure of more than 9,000 banks during the Great Depression altered risk in the network. We find that the pyramid structure of the commercial banking system (i.e., the network’s topology) created more inherent fragility, but systemic risk was nevertheless fairly dispersed throughout banks in 1929, with the top 20 banks contributing roughly 18% of total systemic risk. The massive banking crisis that occurred between 1930 33 raised systemic risk per bank by 33% and increased the riskiness of the very largest banks in the system. We use Bayesian methods to demonstrate that when network measures, such as eigenvector centrality and a bank’s systemic risk contribution, are combined with balance sheet data capturing ex ante bank default risk, they strongly predict bank survivorship in 1934.",2018,2018-12-28,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Ex-ante; Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Balance sheet; Position (finance); Eigenvector centrality; Great Depression; Financial system; Fragility,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:25405,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:25405 https://www.nber.org/papers/w25405 https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/13416.html http://www.nber.org/papers/w25405,lens,006-873-058-630-103

The recent of additional capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions is one example of the concrete measures that are being taken by regulators to mitigate systemic risk. In order to assist market participants in assessing and tracking systemic risk in the financial system, the Volatility Laboratory of the NYU Stern School of Business developed a quantitative indicator, called SRISK, which estimates the expected capital shortfall faced by a firm in a potential future financial crisis. Conceptually, SRISK is similar to the stress tests that are regularly applied to financial institutions however, it is based exclusively on publicly available information (market and accounting data) and is quick and inexpensive to compute. Those firms with a high capital shortfall in a crisis that is, when capital is low in the financial system are the ones with the potential to extend the crisis and impact the broader economy.

"Forero-Laverde, G.",The impossible trinity and financial stability the incidence of trilemma regimes on the (in)satability of stock markets and credit aggregates (1922-2013),"This dissertation discusses the accumulation and unwinding of financial imbalances in stock markets and credit aggregates in advanced economies since the interwar years until the present. The project is framed within the literature that arose with the Great Financial Crisis (2007-09) and that, against the mainstream consensus at the time, posits the existence of a financial cycle best characterised by the joint evolution of asset prices and credit. As a theoretical framework, we build on the open macroeconomy trilemma which indicates that policymakers can choose two out of three desirable and competing goals: fixed exchange rates, free capital flows, and autonomous monetary policy. We construct exchange rate and capital control regimes, for twelve advanced economies, from several sources to identify whether the behaviour of the boom-bust cycle in asset prices and credit growth and the drivers of financial instability are contingent on changing institutional conditions. Additionally, we test for the existence of a global financial cycle, proxied by the United States, which may be driving the evolution of both dependent variables. In the first part of the dissertation which covers the literature review (chapter 1) and the data and methodology (chapter 2), we tackle the issue of measuring financial imbalances. To shift from the usual framework of financial crises towards the study of financial stability, we develop a new indicator for expansions and contractions in financial time series: the Local Bull Bear Indicator (LBBI). This technique, which constitutes the main methodological contribution of the dissertation, identifies above or below trend risk-adjusted returns, expressed as standard deviations. It allows for the identification of expansions and contractions to different time horizons, according to the persistence of shocks. As a data contribution, we offer a dating and characterisation of boom and bust phases in stock markets and credit aggregates, to different time horizons, for all the countries in the database. Regarding the empirical findings, the second part of the dissertation presents panel data evidence using a panel corrected standard errors model (PCSE) for stocks (chapter 3) and credit (chapter 4). First, regarding the literature on global financial integration, we find evidence of a global financial cycle proxied by the US stock market and credit aggregates. Secondly, we find that the relationship between the dependent variables and a selection of control variables and trilemma-associated covariates is contingent on the way in which countries resolve the macroeconomic trilemma at different times. Finally, regarding financial stability, we find that beyond price stability, the variables that drive LBBIs are contingent on the way countries resolve the macroeconomic trilemma at different moments in history. The third part of the dissertation presents time-series evidence for two case studies on the United Kingdom. Chapterdiscusses whether the evolution of the stock market is contingent on domestic policy or trilemma regimes and finds that the usual story of global financial integration following a U-shape with peaks during the gold standard and the present-day inflation targeting regime requires nuance. The long-run co-movement between the stock market in the UK and the global cycle seems to peak in periods of heightened systemic risk such as the Second World War and the two oil shocks (1973, 1978). Finally, Chapterfinds that there is a financial cycle in the UK and that the causal relationship between stocks and credit for the UK is both time-varying and contingent on the regulatory framework in place. As the financial system becomes unregulated, credit growth seems to drive the behaviour in asset prices, allowing us to conclude, preliminarily, that while price stability is important, policymakers should include the evolution of credit aggregates in their policymaking function.",2018,2018-11-23,0,,,Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Economics; Capital control; Financial crisis; Impossible trinity; Stock market; Financial integration; Trilemma; Monetary economics,http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/126487,http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/126487 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=230503 http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/126487/1/GFL_PhD_THESIS.pdf,lens,000-767-708-621-739

"Delpini, D.; Battiston, S.; Caldarelli, G.; Riccaboni, M.","The network ofs mutual fund investments: diversification, similarity and fragility throughout theglobal financial crisis","Network theory proved recently to be useful in the quantification of many properties of financial systems. The analysis of the structure of investment portfolios is a major application since their eventual correlation and overlap impact the actual risk diversification by individual investors. We nvestigate the bipartite network of US mutual fund portfolios and their assets. We follow its evolution during the Global Financial Crisis and analyse the interplay between diversification, as understood in classical portfolio theory, and similarity of the investments of different funds. We show that, on average, portfolios have become more diversified and less similar during the crisis. However, we also find that large overlap is far more likely than expected from models of random allocation of investments. This indicates the existence of strong correlations between fund portfolio strategies. We introduce a simplified model of propagation of financial shocks, that we exploit to show that a systemic risk component origins from the similarity of portfolios. The network is still vulnerable after crisis because of this effect, despite the increase in the diversification of portfolios. Our indicate that diversification may even increase systemic risk when funds diversify in the same way. Diversification and similarity can play antagonistic roles and the trade-off between the two should be taken into account to properly assess systemic risk.",2018,2018-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Financial economics; Network theory; Systemic risk; Economics; Diversification (finance); Investment (macroeconomics); Mutual fund; Financial crisis; Portfolio; Modern portfolio theory,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1801.02205.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1801.02205.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1801.02205,lens,004-617-399-805-367

"Busch, D.; Rijn, M.B.J.v.",Towards single supervision and resolution of systemically important non-bank financial institutions in the european union,"The global financial crisis proved that banks are not the sole source of systemic risk to the financial system and the wider economy. Indeed, systemic risk emanating from non-bank financial institutions proved to be a key vulnerability of the financial system. Such risks occurred, above all, when leveraged non-bank financial institutions performed bank-like activities such as maturity and or liquidity transformation. However, the increasingly blurred distinction between markets, financial institutions, services and products is not matched in the European Union by an integrated regulatory and supervisory approach. Instead, regulation was and remains largely organised along sectoral lines, with an emphasis on the banking sector. As the global financial crisis shows, this creates a risk of gaps in the coverage of regulation and supervision, leading to inconsistent regulatory treatment of equivalent products and or services. This in turn causes an unlevel playing field and increases the potential for regulatory arbitrage. In consequence, risky activities migrate to less regulated or unregulated parts of the financial system, leading to a largely unchecked build-up of systemic risk. Drawing inspiration from the reforms in the United States, we propose that the EU’s system of financial regulation be complemented by a robust body charged with identifying and monitoring non-bank financial institutions that are systemically important. This EU authority should have the discretion to designate a non-bank financial institution as a Non-Bank Systemically Important Financial Institution (non-bank SIFI). A logical choice would be to confer such powers on the European Systemic Risk Board. Designated non-bank SIFIs should be placed under direct prudential supervision by an EU body. This EU supervisor would have to establish, on an individual or categorical basis, appropriate enhanced prudential requirements tailored to the nature, risks and activities of the relevant non-bank SIFI. Additionally, a single European resolution regime should be in place to ensure that non-bank SIFIs can fail without destabilising the financial system. This would avoid a possible Too-Big-To-Fail’ status, remove implicit government guarantees and subject the institution to market discipline. Our proposal aims to ensure that non-bank SIFIs are brought within a regulatory perimeter and supervisory scrutiny consistent with the risk they pose to financial stability. Such a regime would (i) help to eliminate (national) supervisory and regulatory gaps, (ii) reduce regulatory arbitrage activities, and (iii) contribute to the stability of the financial system and a level playing field.",2018,2018-03-28,8,European Business Organization Law Review,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Financial crisis; Financial institution; Level playing field; Market discipline; European union; Maturity (finance); Financial regulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40804-018-0107-5,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F193771 https://core.ac.uk/display/160152779 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40804-018-0107-5 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40804-018-0107-5 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40804-018-0107-5.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40804-018-0107-5/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/download/200773151.pdf,lens,008-542-070-793-673

"Caux, R.D.",An agent-based approach to modelling long-term systemic risk in networks of interacting banks,"The recent banking crisis has led to a spate of literature investigating the concept of systemic risk, aiming to understand the stability of specific financial systems and how contagion can spread through them following stress events. However, the primary focus of this literature has been on static networks, rather than dynamic systems that evolve over time and are shaped by participant interactions. Such a long-term focus is necessary to fully understand how systems will react to policy changes. This thesis analyses two banking systems that are subject to systemic risk, but also feature both micro-level contagion dynamics and strategic interactions between participants. The first is the large value payment system CHAPS, in which participating banks face a strategic decision for how to make their payments in an optimal manner. The second is the relationship between the resolution of insolvent banks and system efficiency, including whether the moral hazard effect created by bank bailouts causes the system to evolve suboptimally. Both systems are analysed using agent-based models with respect to a long term social welfare"" measure that balances bank profitability with the costs caused by contagion. The models generate that would not be possible through a static analysis of the systems without adaptive banks. The payment system is shown to operate below its social optimum, as banks do not endogenise the systemic risk externalities caused by strategies that appear optimal at an individual level. This leads to insufficient liquidity in the system and the queuing of non-priority payments in an inefficient manner. In the insolvency model, a policy of regulatory intervention shapes bank risk-taking over the long term, with the short term gains of a bailout leading over time to excessive bank leverage, a higher number of insolvencies and reduced social welfare. A targeted strategy of only bailing out specific institutions that are Too-Big-To-Fail also reduces long term system efficiency.",2017,2017-01-01,1,,,Profitability index; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Payment system; Bailout; Moral hazard; Insolvency; Monetary economics; Leverage (finance),https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/417987/,https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/417987/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.736713,lens,010-548-187-210-987

More than prediction, our main goal is to understand the evolution of systematic and idiosyncratic risks in the U.S. economy over this particular time period, leading to novel sector- specific risk indexes. To accomplish this goal, we model the appearance of extreme losses in each market using a superposition of two Poisson processes, one that corresponds to systematic risks that are shared by all sectors, and one that correspond to the idiosyncratic risk associated with a specific sector. In order to capture changes in the risk structure over time, the intensity functions associated with each of the underlying components are modeled using a Dirichlet process mixture model. Among other interestingour analysis of theP500 index suggests that there are few idiosyncratic risks associated with the consumer staples sector, whose extreme negative log returns appear to be driven mostly by systematic risks.

"Rönnqvist, S.; Sarlin, P.",Bank distress in the news: describing events through deep learning,"While many models are purposed for detecting the occurrence of significant events in financial systems, the task of providing qualitative detail on the developments is not usually as well automated. We present a deep learning approach for detecting relevant discussion in text and extracting natural language descriptions of events.

"Schwarcz, S.L.",Banking and financial regulation,"This chapter provides a basic overview of banking and financial regulation for the forthcoming Oxford Handbook of Law and Economics (Francesco Parisi, ed.). Among other things, the chapter compares traditional and shadow banking and their regulation, differentiating microprudential regulation (which focuses on protecting individual components of the financial system, such as banks) and macroprudential regulation (which focuses on protecting against systemic risk). The chapter also examines how regulation can help to correct market failures that undermine financial efficiency. In that context, it discusses, among other things, capital requirements, ring-fencing, and stress testing. Finally, the chapter examines how regulation can help to protect against systemic risk, including by addressing potential triggers of systemic risk (such as maturity transformation the asset-liability mismatch that from the short-term funding of long-term projects and limited liability).",2017,2017-04-13,1,the Oxford Handbook of Law and Economics,,Limited liability; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market efficiency; Retail banking; Financial crisis; Capital requirement; Maturity (finance); Financial regulation; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199684205.013.028,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2479541 https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/abstract/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199684205.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199684205-e-028 https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199684205.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199684205-e-028 https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/3352/ https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6038&context=faculty_scholarship https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2488626_code485747.pdf?abstractid=2479541&mirid=1 http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199684205.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199684205-e-028,lens,003-719-007-430-158

We split this interval into different time periods. Each one of them has also been divided into two different sub-periods among which one served as estimation mean and the second one helped to test the estimated parameters obtained using a times series regression. Afterwards some statistical tests have been conducted to see whether the CAPM’s hypotheses hold or not. The findings showed that higher risk is not associated with higher level of return within the study area. Also, there was no relation between stock return and non-systemic risk except for one period where we found evidence that stock returns were affected by other risk than the systematic risk. On the contrary the stock expected rate of return had a linear relationship with the systematic risk.

"Wittström, E.",Central retinal vein occlusion in younger swedish adults: case reports and review of the literature,"Purpose: To investigate associated systemic diseases, other conditions, visual outcome, ocular complications and treatment in Swedish patients younger than 50 years with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and reviewing the literature. Methods: Twenty-two patients with CRVO, younger than 50 years, were examined with full-field electroretinography (ERG) withinmonths after a thrombotic event, or were periodically examined and were observed for at leastmonths. In 18 of these patients, the initial retinal ischemia was studied using the cone b-wave implicit time in the 30 Hz flicker ERG. Fifteen patients also underwent fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in 14 patients. The patients studied were divided into two groups, non-ischemic and ischemic, which were compared. All patients underwent ocular and systemic examination, as well as complete screening for thrombophilic risk factors.Of the 22 patients, 15 had non-ischemic type of CRVO andthe ischemic type. Patients with non-ischemic CRVO showed significantly improved visual acuity (VA) at the final examination (p 0.006). Patients with ischemic CRVO showed no significant reduction in VA at the final examination (p 0.225). Systemic hypertension (27% in non-ischemic CRVO and 29% in ischemic CRVO) was the most prevalent systemic risk factor for CRVO. The mean central foveal thickness (CFT) decreased significantly from 402.3 136.2 (μm) at the initial examination to 243.8 48.1 (μm) at the final examination in the non-ischemic group (p 0.005). The mean initial CFT was 444.5 186.1 (μm) in the ischemic CRVO group, which decreased to 211.5 20.2 (μm) at the final visit (p 0.068). Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) pigmentary glaucoma (PG), ocular hypertension and dehydration were equally frequent four patients each (18%) out of 22. The clinical course ofyounger patients with PDS PG are described. Conclusion: The patients with non-ischemic CRVO showed significantly improved VA and significantly decreased CFT at the final examination. Systemic hypertension was the most prevalent risk factor for CRVO. Younger adults with CRVO also had a high prevalence of PDS PG, ocular hypertension and dehydration. This study highlights the importance of careful IOP monitoring, and the need to investigate possible PDS PG and to obtain an accurate history of the patient including alcohol intake and intense exercise.

"Gehrig, T.; Iannino, M.C.",Did the basel process of capital regulation enhance the resiliency of european banks,"This paper analyses the evolution of the safety and soundness of the European banking sector during the various stages of the Basel process of capital regulation. In the first part we document the evolution of various measures of systemic risk as the Basel process unfolds. Most strikingly, we find that the exposure to systemic risk as measured by SRISK has been steeply rising for the highest quintile, moderately rising for the second quintile and remaining roughly stationary for the remaining three quintiles of listed European banks. This observation suggests that the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk for the majority of European banks but not for the largest institutions. In the second part we analyse the drivers of systemic risk. We find compelling evidence that the increase in exposure to systemic risk (SRISK) is intimately tied to the implementation of internal models for determining credit risk as well as market risk. Based on this evidence, the sub-prime crisis found especially the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared and lacking resiliency. This condition has even aggravated during the European sovereign crisis. Banking Union has not (yet) brought about a significant increase in the safety and soundness of the European banking system.

"Rewizorski, M.",G20 and the development of a new global governance mechanism,"The main of this article is to analyse the new global governance mechanism developed at the G20 forum by nineteen individual countries, along with the European Union (represented by the European Commission and the European Council), cooperating with international organizations (IOs) and government officials (GOs). In the subsequent sections,argue that the new mechanistic and praxis-oriented mechanism of global governance is built on the nexus between (1) the G20 acting as a hub of multi-level cooperation and as an apex systemic risk manager (2) IOs offering expertise on specific issue areas and (3) GOs as sherpas, or ministers responsible for specific subjects, who are able to meet before and after commitments, and are endorsed by and influence the iteration leaders use at subsequent summits to soften difficult issues. The mechanism represents a departure from the Schumpeterian creative destruction process, understood in broader terms as not restricted solely to the role of entrepreneurs and innovations, but extended also towards global politics and institutions (norms, systems, and organizations). As shown in G20 communiques and declarations, the elite global governance institutions are providing valuable input to the G20 process.

"Rosa, C.D.; Luciano, E.; Regis, L.",Geographical diversification and longevity risk mitigation in annuity portfolios,"This paper provides a method for assessing the regulatory and systemic risk relief deriving from a foreign expansion by a life-insurance company. We build a parsimonious continuous-time model for longevity risk, that captures the dependence across different ages in domestic versus foreign populations. We provide two measures of the diversification effects of expanding an annuity portfolio toward a foreign population. The reduction in the risk margin, computed A la Solvency II, provides a measure of the benefit in the tail risk. The Diversification Index provides an assessment of the average diversification benefit of combining different populations in one portfolio. We calibrate the model to portray the case of a UK annuity portfolio expanding internationally towards Italian policyholders. Our application shows that the longevity risk diversification benefits of an international expansion are sizable, in particular when interest rates are low.",2017,2017-01-01,1,,,Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Interest rate; Tail risk; Portfolio; Longevity risk; Population; Life insurance; Risk management,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cca/wpaper/546.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cca/wpaper/546.html,lens,008-657-824-722-872

Smart Mature Resilience develops resilience management guidelines based on a Resilience Maturity Model that engages a growing number of stakeholders and multilevel governance in order for cities to become vertebrae for society’s resilience backbone. In a dual approach, employing a systematic literature review of international resilience implementation approaches alongside group processes with experts, the Smart Mature Resilience project has developed a preliminary resilience maturity model consisting of five stages Starting, Moderate, Advanced, Robust and verTebrate (SMART) and a Systemic Risk Assessment Questionnaire. The SMART Resilience Maturity Model suggests two principal processes for the transition to resilience maturity: (1) A process of increasing engagement and collaboration with new stakeholder types, from local, to regional, to national to European in a growing resilience backbone, and (2) a process of quality improvement of policies for transitioning from a Safety-I to a Safety-II perspective (from risk assessment mitigation to adaption to future surprises as conditions evolve).",2017,2017-11-18,5,Ifip Advances in Information and Communication Technology,,Environmental resource management; Engineering; Natural disaster; Process management; Stakeholder; Resilience (network); Urban resilience; Maturity (finance); Risk management; Socio-ecological system; Capability Maturity Model,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68486-4_4,https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/stalking-resilience(2bfcc3ca-b42b-4065-adb2-f734e212d729).html https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/stalking-resilience-cities-as-vertebrae-in-societys-resilience-ba https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/59674/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/itdrr/itdrr2016.html#GonzalezBEGHHMP16 https://core.ac.uk/download/77036656.pdf,lens,000-175-971-032-553

"Kane, E.J.",Insurance contracts and derivatives that substitute for them: how and where should their systemic and nonperformance risks be regulated,"Traditionally, individual states have shared responsibility for regulating the US insurance industry. The Dodd Frank Act changes this by tasking the Federal Reserve with regulating the systemic risks that particularly large insurance organizations might pose and assigning the regulation of swap-based substitutes for insurance and reinsurance products to the SEC and CFTC. This paper argues that prudential regulation of large insurance firms and weaknesses in federal swaps regulation could reduce the effectiveness of state-based systems in protecting policyholders and taxpayers from nonperformance in the insurance industry. Swap-based substitutes for traditional insurance and reinsurance contracts offer protection sellers a way to transfer responsibility for guarding against nonperformance into potentially less-effective hands. The CFTC and SEC lack the focus, expertise, experience, and resources to adequately manage the ways that swap transactions can affect US taxpayers’ equity position in global safety nets, while regulators at the Fed refuse to recognize that conscientiously monitoring accounting capital at financial holding companies will not adequately protect taxpayers and policyholders until and unless it is accompanied by severe penalties for managers that willfully hide their firm’s exposure to destructive tail risks.",2017,2017-09-15,0,"Advances in Pacific Basin Business, Economics and Finance",,General insurance; Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Reinsurance; Insurance law; Casualty insurance; Equity (finance); Insurance policy; Swap (finance),http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/s2514-465020170000001001,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S2514-465020170000001001/full/html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2419617 http://indstate.edu/business/nfi/leadership/briefs/2014-pb-03_kane.pdf https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/S2514-465020170000001001,lens,002-857-969-603-485
"Bhattacharjee, B.; Shafi, M.; Acharjee, A.",Investigating the evolution of linkage dynamics among equity markets using network models and measures: the case of asian equity market integration,"The state of cross-market linkage structures and its stability over varying time-periods play a key role in the performance of international diversified portfolios. There has been an increasing interest of global investors in emerging capital markets in the Asian region. In this setting, an investigation into the temporal dynamics of cross-market linkage structures becomes significant for the selection and optimal allocation of securities in an internationally-diversified portfolio. In the quest for this, in the current study, weighted network models along with network metrics are employed to decipher the underlying cross-market linkage structures among Asian markets. The study analyses the daily return data of fourteen major Asian indices for a period of 14 years (2002 2016). The topological properties of the network are computed using centrality measures and measures of influence strength and are investigated over temporal scales. In particular, the overall influence strengths and India-specific influence strengths are computed and examined over a temporal scale. Threshold filtering is also performed to characterize the dynamics related to the linkage structure of these networks. The impacts of the 2008 financial crisis on the linkage structural patterns of these equity networks are also investigated. The key findings of this study include: a set of central and peripheral indices, the evolution of the linkage structures over the 2002 2016 period and the linkage dynamics during times of market stress. Mainly, the set of indices possessing influence over the Asian region in general and the Indian market in particular is also identified.

"Eerola, E.",Macroprudential measures in the housing markets a note on the empirical literature,"Purpose The global financial crisis has led to increased attention on the relationship of household indebtedness and systemic risks. As a result, macroprudential measures aimed at reducing the risks have been introduced in many countries. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent empirical literature on the measures targeted at households in the housing markets. Design methodology approach This note reviews and discusses the recent empirical literature on macroprudential measures targeted at households in the housing market as well as housing-related tax policy measures. Findings To date, the literature mostly consists of cross-country studies using aggregate data and looking at a large set of different measures. The studies typically report associations between the measures and the outcome variables of interest (often credit growth and house price appreciation), but do not assess the causal effects of the different measures or the underlying mechanisms. Originality value Exploiting household data together with policy reforms should be a useful step forward in understanding the effects of the measures and uncovering the mechanisms through which they operate. This would also allow studying the distributional effects of the measures. Understanding the distributional effects is important in its own right, but it is also required because the ultimate goals of the macroprudential policies are related not only to the aggregate level of credit but also to the distribution of leverage.",2017,2017-05-15,4,the Journal of Risk Finance,,Public economics; Debt; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Tax policy; Originality; Aggregate data; Financial crisis; Literature study; Leverage (finance),http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jrf-10-2016-0135,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eme:jrfpps:jrf-10-2016-0135 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:bof:bofrdp:2016_018 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eme/jrfpps/jrf-10-2016-0135.html http://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/149337 https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JRF-10-2016-0135 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JRF-10-2016-0135/full/html https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/123456789/14189/1/BoF_DP_1618.pdf https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/handle/123456789/14189 https://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/149337,lens,010-492-734-668-891

"Loo, R.V.",Making innovation more competitive: the case of fintech,"Finance startups are offering automated advice, touchless payments, and other products that could bring great societal benefits, including lower prices and expanded access to credit. Yet unlike in other digital arenas in which American companies were global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the U.S. has lagged in consumer finance. This Article posits that the current competition framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then identifies a contributor that has yet to be articulated: the organizational design of administrative agencies. Competition authority including antitrust and the extension of business licenses is spread across at least five regulators. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate. The Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review. No regulator has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote competition in consumer finance. Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw. If allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengersfintechscould bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of Too Big To Fail banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, either fintech startups or the big banks acquiring them may reach the size of technology giants, thereby increasing systemic risk.

Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which envisages the relationship between risk and the expected rate of return on a risky security, is found unrelated in DSE market. As proper risk-return relationships of the market is seems to be deficient in DSE and the market is not liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being very insignificant.

Sprague's descriptions are also used to describe the tradeoffs and the time-consistency problem faced by bank regulators.

"Huang, Y.; Liu, T.; Lien, D.",Portfolio homogenization and systemic risk of financial network,"In this paper, we argue that systemic risk should be understood from two different perspectives, the homogeneity of portfolios (or called asset homogeneity) and the contagion mechanism. The homogenization of portfolios held by different financial institutions increases the positive correlations among them and therefore the probability of simultaneous collapses of a considerable part of the network, which are prerequisites and amplifiers of contagion. We first theoretically analyze the influence of asset homogeneity on the initial risk, fragility and systemic risk of the network. Based on the theoretical predictions, we perform simulations on regular networks and Poisson random networks to illustrate the effects of portfolio homogeneity on systemic risk. It is shown that the relationship between asset homogeneity and systemic risk is not always positively related. When the network contagion is weak, then a high asset homogeneity will lead to a high systemic risk. However, if the network contagion is considerably strong, the systemic risk is quite likely to be negative related to the asset homogeneity, so that a high homogeneity will produce a low systemic risk. Moreover, networks with strong contagion and low asset homogeneity tend to have the greatest systemic risk. from logistic regression analysis further clarify the relationships between systemic risk and asset homogeneity.",2017,2017-10-13,0,,,Poisson distribution; Finance; Homogeneity (statistics); Systemic risk; Logistic regression; Economics; Asset (economics); Goodwill; Portfolio; Fragility,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/82956.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/82956.html https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/82956/,lens,004-797-411-299-411

The result suggests that systemic risk acts as a collusion device for banks: while high concentration is not enough to have collusion, the true effects of high market concentration on interest rates’ mark-ups emerge when the system is under stress.",2017,2017-03-26,0,Banks and Bank Systems,,Business; Systemic risk; Interest rate; Market power; Intermediation; Market concentration; Index (economics); Collusion; Monetary economics; Scopus,https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/8181,https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/handle/1992/8181 https://www.businessperspectives.org/index.php/journals/banks-and-bank-systems/issue-170/risk-concentration-and-market-power-in-the-banking-industry-evidence-from-the-colombian-system-1997-2006 https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/bitstream/1992/8181/1/dcede2007-27.pdf,lens,004-571-279-603-583
"Bazrafkan, A.; Herwig, A.","Risk, responsibility, and fairness in international investment law","International investment agreements (IIAs) accommodate two framings of risk in need of mitigation: political risks and risks of physical externalities. The chapter discloses that there is no consistency in the finer-grained framing of these risks in arbitral awards, and analyses these framings from the perspective of the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard. It is argued that the requirements of fairness and equity call for a just distribution of systemic risks, which IIAs create. It must be ensured that IIAs yield greater ex ante benefits than risks for each stakeholder. The implication is twofold: governmental regulation necessary to protect human rights can never give rise to a right to damages under FET for frustration of expectations and good faith imperfections in regulations by developing countries must be tolerable insofar as emerging development is the constitutive reason for why foreign investment is likely to yield higher ex ante benefits than risks to investors.",2017,2017-06-22,0,Oxford Scholarship Online,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198795896.003.0013,,lens,000-650-653-586-913

As supply chains expand globally and companies pursue velocity and efficiency, the probability of disruptions propagating throughout a chain grows. In this paper, we employ a qualitative, grounded theory case study approach to help understand what drives supply chain disruption propagation and to provide theoretical insights into this emerging area. For a more complete perspective, we study three interconnected tiers in seven unique supply chains. Each supply chain triad consists of (1) a focal firm (a manufacturer), (2) a supplier to the focal firm and (3) a customer of the focal firm allowing us to gain perspective from three levels in multiple supply chains.

"Woebbeking, F.",Systemic risk and capital adequacy,"We assess transmission channels of systemic risk and the effects of capital regulation in the European Banking Union. Two interconnected channels of risk are analysed by employing a data-driven, heterogeneous network model. First, the risk from shocks to corporate, sovereign and retail debt holdings of banks and second, the subsequent contagion effects that spread through the interbank market. A Bayesian approach is used to reconstruct the network of interbank exposures by Gibbs-sampling conditional on publicly available data. The effects of both channels are further magnified by the inclusion of default costs. We provide measures and rankings that aim at a realistic review of the resilience and contagion threat from single banks, countries and different assets. In addition, we draw policy implications from the effectiveness of regulatory capital requirements by applying treatments to the CT1 capital of individual banks in the network. Our findings suggest that the effects of micro prudential regulation fall short of their expected effectiveness. More specifically, the positive of stricter capital regulation are largely compensated by contagion effects and changes in asset exposures.",2017,2017-04-12,0,Social Science Research Network,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Capital adequacy ratio; Interbank lending market; Banking union; Bank regulation; Capital requirement; Monetary economics; Economic capital; Capital (economics),https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2951065,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2951065,lens,005-295-662-722-591

"Berdin, E.; Sottocornola, M.",Systemic risk in insurance: towards a new approach,"During the last IAIS Global Seminar in June 2017, IAIS disclosed the agenda for a gradual shift in the systemic risk assessment methodology from the current Entity Based Approach (EBA) to a new Activity Based Approach(ABA). The EBA, which was developed in the aftermath of the 2008 2009 financial crisis, defines a list of Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs) based on a pre-defined set of criteria related to the size of the institution. These G-SIIs are subject to additional regulatory requirements since their distress or disorderly failure would potentially cause significant disruption to the global financial system and economic activity. Even if size is still a needed element of a systemic risk assessment, the strong emphasis put on the too-big-to-fail approach in insurance, i.e. EBA, might be partially missing the underlying nature of systemic risk in insurance. Not only certain activities, including insurance activities such as life or non-life lines of business, but also common exposures or certain managerial practices such as leverage or funding structures, tend to contribute to systemic risk of insurers but are not covered by the current EBA (Berdin and Sottocornola, 2015).

"Millard, D.",The impact of the twin peaks model on the insurance industry,"Financial regulation in South Africa changes constantly. In the quest to find the ideal regulatory framework for optimal consumer protection, rules change all the time and international trends have an important influence on lawmakers nationally. The Financial Sector Regulation Bill, also known as the ""Twin Peaks"" Bill, is the latest invention from the table of the legislature, and some expect this Bill to have far-reaching consequences for the financial services industry. The question is, of course, whether the current dispensation will change so quickly and so dramatically that it will literally be the end of the world as we know it or whether there will be a gradual shift in emphasis away from the so-called silo regulatory approach to an approach that distinguishes between prudential regulation on the one hand and market conduct regulation on the other. A further question is whether insurance as a financial service will change dramatically in the light of the expected twin peak dispensation. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of the FSR Bill for the insurance industry. Instead of analysing the Bill feature for feature, the method that will be used in this enquiry is to identify trends and issues from 2014 and to discuss whether the Twin Peaks model, once implemented, can successfully eradicate similar problems in future. The impact of Twin Peaks will of course have to be tested, but at this point in time it may be very useful to take an educated guess by using recent cases as examples. Recent cases before the courts, the Enforcement Committee and the FAIS Ombud will be discussed not only as examples of the most prevalent issues of the past year or so, but also as examples of how consumer issues and systemic risks are currently being dealt with and how this may change with the implementation of the FSR Bill.",2017,2017-05-17,0,Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal,,Financial services; Systemic risk; Discount points; Economics; Law; Ideal (ethics); Enforcement; Consumer protection; Financial regulation; Legislature,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/1727-3781/2016/v19i0a1503,https://journals.assaf.org.za/per/article/download/1503/2634 https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/21715 https://perjournal.co.za/article/download/1503/2634 https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=6647c903-f527-4cb4-9443-3f6ffc2d4d4e http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1727-37812016000100043 https://www.ajol.info/index.php/pelj/article/view/151592 http://www.scielo.org.za/pdf/pelj/v19n1/43.pdf https://www.ajol.info/index.php/pelj/article/download/151592/141185 https://journals.assaf.org.za/per/article/view/1503 https://perjournal.co.za/article/view/1503 https://dspace.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/21715 https://journals.assaf.org.za/per/article/viewFile/1503/1346,lens,006-477-487-348-208
"Anadu, K.; Baklanova, V.","The intersection ofs money market mutual fund reforms, bank liquidity requirements, and the federal home loan bank system","The most recent changes to money market fund regulations have had a strong impact on the money fund industry. In the months leading up to the compliance date of the core provisions of the amended regulations, assets in prime money market funds declined significantly, while those in government funds increased contemporaneously. This reallocation from prime to government funds has contributed to the latter’s increased demand for debt issued by the U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises. The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) System played a key role in meeting this heightened demand for U.S. government-related assets with increased issuance of short-term debt. The FHLBank System uses the funding obtained from money market funds to provide general liquidity to its members, including the largest U.S. banks. Large U.S. banks’ increased borrowings from the FHLBank System are motivated, in large part, by other post-crisis regulations, specifically the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The intersection of money market mutual fund reforms and the LCR have contributed to the FHLBanks’ increased reliance on short-term funding to finance relatively longer-term assets, primarily collateralized loans to its largest members. This funding model could be vulnerable to runs and impact financial markets and financial institutions in ways that are difficult to predict. While a funding run seems unlikely, it is often the violation of commonly held conventions that tend to pose financial stability risks. Indeed, runs on leveraged financial intermediaries engaged in maturity transformation have produced systemic risks issues in the past and are worthy of investigation and continuous monitoring.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Financial market; Money market; Mutual fund; Loan; Money market fund; Financial intermediary; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3066962,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3066962,lens,001-242-642-697-03X

This dataset, which contains all the relevant dimensions of systemic risk stemming from and affecting national banking systems, is compiled from firm-level supervisory returns. With the entry into force of the new set of European Banking Authority (EBA) Implementing Technical Standards on Supervisory Reporting in 2014, the whole CBD statistical framework had to be reshaped. In August 2015 the first data for the revised CBD were released. This paper deals with the main issues in the challenging endeavour of transposing firmlevel supervisory returns, often based on different accounting systems, into comprehensive aggregate statistics, while ensuring as far as possible continuity in the time series for indicators and aggregates calculated from different successive data models. At the same time, the new CBD has substantially enlarged the quantity and increased the quality of data, available to the users.

"Hughes, C.M.",The regulatory dilemma: an interdisciplinary perspective into how regulation can be used to impact innovation,"Innovation is an emergent property of a complex socioeconomic system. It is an evolutionary process that through the interactions of entities within their environment it gives rise to something new. This process of innovation continually disrupts the modus operandi, thus allowing the system to evolve over time. However, failure to anticipate the future states of the system poses significant systemic risk as witnessed by the Financial Crisis of 2008. Therefore, policy-makers need sufficient and reliable knowledge as to how to steer the system towards better outcomes for society. Problematically, understanding this relationship can often be beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice. Therefore, this thesis is organised around the idea as to how regulation can be used to impact innovation through an interdisciplinary perspective. Hence, the first paper systematically analyses the research area by conglomerating the fragmented literature that reside around this domain. This is in order to identify gaps, themes, relationships and deficiencies within the research stream. The second paper then looks towards agent-based modelling a method for measuring complex systems as a suitable way to answer the issues raised by the first manuscript. This was achieved by breaking up the agent-based literature to analyse its effectiveness for understanding this relationship. From this the author systematically compared and contrasted the various design specifications of the agent-based models, thus providing a relevant framework to analyse how different policies can shape the market mechanism through various policy s. These findings are subsequently converged to frame the final paper, which the author calls the Regulatory Dilemma. This aims to measure the aggressiveness of a variety of policy-instruments to see what effect they have on the system via agent-based simulation. Hence, the research contributes to existing literature on how regulation shapes the innovation process however, specifically facilitating the gap that analyses the stringency of two policy instruments that target towards both the inventor (i.e. through rewarding invention) and the imitator (i.e. penalising imitation). Consequently, this presents an interesting insight into how regulation can impact the dynamics of the system. It also seems to prove a useful tool to transcend borders set by standard analytical models and open up promising avenues for future policy design. More research plans to extend this model with greater adaption and realism for the pre-assessment as to the effectiveness of the proposed policies.",2017,2017-05-01,0,,,Variety (cybernetics); Systemic risk; Set (psychology); Order (exchange); Process management; Market mechanism; Dilemma; Scope (project management); Computer science; Process (engineering),https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.741664,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.741664 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/419975/,lens,007-862-412-550-302

A decrease in a bank’s equity capital in substantially more frequent violations of its self-reported risk levels in the following quarter. These are consistent with the view that banks under-report their risks to lower their current regulatory capital requirements at the expense of potentially higher future capital requirements that follow if the under-reporting is detected. The under-reporting is especially high during the critical periods of high systemic risk and for banks with larger trading operations.

One trans-national effort involves applying new global capital requirements to Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs), whose failure could trigger a new financial crisis. Talks are also underway regarding new global capital requirements for large insurance companies with significant foreign operations that do not present systemic risks to their own economies or the global financial system. We analyze the rationale for this new approach and the costs associated with applying it to large U.S. property and casualty (P C) insurers. We find that additional capital requirements are unnecessary, because even the largest U.S.C insurers pose no systemic risk to the U.S. or global financial systems. We further find that current state based capital requirements for U.S.C insurers are sufficient to ensure that they can handle the claims arising from even the most extraordinary losses.

The waves of regulatory reforms and enhanced concern regarding investors protection have recently brought the attention of the regulators to hedge fund regulation issue. But, many academics fear that direct intervention may limit industry growth and benefit. Addressing these concerns, this paper observes the systemic importance of hedge fund industry based on four criteria’s size, leverage, interconnectedness to large complex financial institutions (LCFIs) and herding and concludes that although this industry is still small in terms of size and leverage, their interconnectivity with LCFIs and potential herding make them systemically significant. Hence, regulation of hedge fund is necessary to restrict the transmission of systemic events. Analysing direct and indirect approaches, this paper suggests that the counterparties are best positioned to implement this regulatory change.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Herding; Hedge fund; restrict; Financial system; Leverage (finance); Interconnectedness,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2998048,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2998048 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2998048,lens,003-620-276-543-679
"Krahnen, J.P.; Pelizzon, L.","""Predatory"" margins and the regulation and supervision of central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs)","This note discusses the basic economics of central clearing for derivatives and the need for a proper regulation, supervision and resolution of central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs). New regulation in the U.S. and in Europe renders the involvement of a central counterparty mandatory for standardized OTC derivatives' trading and sets higher capital and collateral requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. From a macrofinance perspective, CCPs provide a trade-off between reduced contagion risk in the financial industry and the creation of a significant systemic risk. However, so far, regulation and supervision of CCPs is very fragmented, limited and ignores two important aspects: the risk of consolidation of CCPs on the one side and the competition among CCPs on the other side. i) As the economies of scale of CCP operations in risk and cost reduction can be large, they provide an argument in favor of consolidation, leading at the extreme to a monopoly CCP that poses the ultimate default riska systemic risk for the entire financial sector. As a systemic risk event requires a government bailout, there is a public policy issue here. ii) As long as no monopoly CCP exists, there is competition for market share among existing CCPs. Such competition may undermine the stability of the entire financial system because it induces ""predatory margining"": a reduction of margin requirements to increase market share. The policy lesson from our consideration emphasizes the importance of a single authority supervising all competing CCPs as well as of a specific regulation and resolution framework for CCPs. Our general recommendations can be applied to the current situation in Europe, and the proposed merger between Deutsche Borse and London Stock Exchange.",2016,2016-01-01,0,,,Clearing; Business; Systemic risk; Market share; Margin (finance); Counterparty; Bailout; Competition (economics); Monopoly; Financial system,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/safewh/41.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/zbw/safewh/41.html,lens,005-553-747-863-51X

There exist already various measures of liquidity risk in the literature. Most of these metrics rely on specic assumptions and expert judgment. In order to overcome potential issues associated to discretional assumptions, similar by the work of Drehman and Nikolau (2012), we propose a metric based on the bidding behaviour of banks in the Chilean open market operations (OMOs). There are dierences in monetary policy making between the advanced economies and Chile. In the advanced countries, monetary authorities inject liquidity whereas in Chile, as there is excess of inows, the authority drains liquidity by selling assets. Thus, we adapt the original metric and we calculate the aggregate -cluster and system level- liquidity indicator for a sample of Chilean banks in a period that includes the recent subprime crisis. We then compare this metric to a variety of standard indicators proposed in the literature. We nd that our proposed metric captures well the liquidity crisis episodes and it can be used as a complementary nancial assessment tool, especially for systemic risk measurement purposes.",2016,2016-12-01,0,Economia Chilena,,Financial economics; Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Economics; Metric (unit); Liquidity crisis; Order (exchange); Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Open market operation; Monetary economics,https://ideas.repec.org/a/chb/bcchec/v19y2016i3p026-067.html,https://www.bcu.gub.uy/Comunicaciones/Jornadas%20de%20Economa/t_becerra_j.%20sebastian_2013_1907.pdf http://www.bvrie.gub.uy/local/File/JAE/2013/t_becerra_j.%20sebastian_2013_1907.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/chb/bcchec/v19y2016i3p026-067.html https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/handle/20.500.12580/3585 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:chb:bcchec:v:19:y:2016:i:3:p:026-067 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:chb:bcchec:v:19:y:2016:i:3:p:026-067,lens,002-628-229-662-237
"Zalewska, A.",A new look at regulating bankers’ remuneration,"Manuscript Type Conceptual Research Questions Issues Executive remuneration, whether as a tool for resolving agency problems or as a sign of them, has been discussed in the literature for decades. The discussion, however, has been focused on non-financial firms, and bankers’ remuneration, particularly in the context of corporate governance, has been overlooked until recently. However, following the financial crisis, regulators have begun intervening into banking boards’ responsibilities, including remuneration. This raises numerous questions, in particular, how far the existing non-financial literature applies to banks, and if not, why and how this impacts on appropriate corporate governance in banking, and what challenges this brings Research Findings Insights The paper argues that due to numerous externalities, notably the interconnectivity and systemic risk of the banking sector, a traditional approach to remuneration based on resolving the principal-agent conflict is inappropriate. Active involvement of regulators is needed to balance the short-term performance of the banking sector with the long-term needs of society. This, however, means that remuneration and corporate governance of banks is no longer an individual bank issue but is a national and probably an international phenomenon. In some cases this may require fundamental changes to the national governance structure, culture, and practices. Theoretical Academic Implications The analysis questions the suitability of the common idea of assessing corporate governance in banks in the same way as is done for non-financial institutions. Given that several traditional non-financial board responsibilities have been partially passed over to regulators in the banking sector, a new theoretical model of corporate governance is needed for banks. The paper examines relational contracts (echoed to some extent in stewardship, stakeholder, and network theories), and argues that these cannot be expected to be successful in the banking environment. Practitioner Policy Implications The paper highlights the importance of tying the corporate governance of banks with other regulatory measures employed to restrict risk taking. It also stresses the need for harmonization of corporate governance metrics for the banking sector at a national international level.",2016,2016-01-11,19,Corporate Governance: an International Review,,Accounting; Agency (sociology); Systemic risk; Economics; Stakeholder; Balance (accounting); Remuneration; Financial crisis; Context (language use); Corporate governance,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/corg.12149,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/CORG_CORG12149.pdf?abstractid=2769048&mirid=5 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/corg.12149 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5431633 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2769048 https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-new-look-at-regulating-bankers-remuneration,lens,002-128-794-364-485

This paper investigates behavioral responses to a natural hazard (flooding) by examining residential property values. The of this investigation can be used to develop benefit cost studies to assess the economic merits of policies that mitigates the risk of floods by using the residential housing market as a proxy for estimating these values since the choice of where to live often includes the choice of hazard level. The methodology described here also provides a mechanism for testing consumer behavior under uncertainty. This study uses a hedonic property price function to estimate the effects of flood hazards on residential property values. The study utilizes data from 158,890 residential home sales in Dublin, Ireland between 2006 and 2015. This area experienced significant flooding in October 2011. GIS is used to spatially characterize the houses included in the analysis by linking them to the following set of parameters included into the baseline regression: house price, house type and size (number of bedrooms and bathrooms), when it was on the market, and its location. Once the baseline regression model is built, then the variables included in it are regressed against the flood-risk. The distance between a set of amenities and the properties is also calculated using GIS. show that a house located within a floodplain has a lower market value than an equivalent house located outside the floodplain.

"Sasso, L.",Bank capital structure and financial innovation: antagonists or two sides of the same coin,"This article examines the challenges to banking capital regulation posed by ongoing financial innovation through regulatory capital arbitrage. On the one hand, such practice undermines the quality of regulatory capital, eroding prudential capital standards, but most importantly it creates a distortion in the regulatory capital ratio measures, which prevents investors and regulators from identifying the bank’s real underlying risks. Opportunities for regulatory capital arbitrage arise as a consequence of the inherent mismatch of accounting goals, corporate law and prudential regulation all interacting with the notion of capital for banks. On the other hand, financial innovation is the result of banks’ risk-management policies. In order to reduce the cost of capital and compliance banks engage in derivatives, structured finance and hybrid instruments, altering the risk return of their cash flow and the information released to the market for disclosure. In a way, regulation is the solution but also part of the problem. For this reason, new regulation strategies for banks need to be implemented. Systemic risk and balance-sheet risk need to be tackled respectively with macro- and micro-prudential regulation. This would involve an international harmonization of the accounting standards and individualised capital adequacy requirements for banks. The regulation has to be functional for the market under examination. The regulator should therefore consider the adoption of prudential filters to make static variables such as accounting rules, which are normally focused on evaluation, more dynamic to give banks some financial flexibility in their risk-management policies.",2016,2016-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Structured finance; Business; Systemic risk; Arbitrage; Capital adequacy ratio; Financial innovation; Capital requirement; Financial system; Cost of capital; Capital (economics),https://ideas.repec.org/p/hig/wpaper/66-law-2016.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hig/wpaper/66-law-2016.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hig:wpaper:66/law/2016 https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/higwpaper/66_2flaw_2f2016.htm,lens,009-641-927-448-589

"Acolin, A.; Bricker, J.; Calem, P.S.; Wachter, S.M.",Borrowing constraints and homeownership,"Borrowing constraints enable lenders to manage risk using non-price terms in the presence of imperfect information but also impact the ability of households to become homeowners. Some individual households’ welfare would improve if constraints were lifted. However, as the subprime crisis demonstrates, indiscriminately lifting borrowing constraints increases risk in the mortgage market unsustainably and can entail systemic risk. The literature has identified three constraints that limit access to mortgages: wealth (through maximum loan to value ratio) income (through maximum debt to income ratio) and credit (through minimum credit score). Households with insufficient wealth or income (relative to their preferred housing consumption and local house prices) or an inadequate credit score are unable to become owners even if that would be the optimal tenure based on their preferences, expected duration of residence, and user cost of owning relative to renting. Changes in the mortgage market can lead to relaxed borrowing constraints, expanded access to mortgages, and increased homeownership. Whether such credit expansions are sustained depends on the ability of financial markets and regulations to ensure proper risk management and assessment. The first section reviews evidence of the existence of credit rationing in the US mortgage market. The second section discusses the impact of borrowing constraints on homeownership outcomes post World War II.

The network of interbank loans is dynamic and simulated every day. We show how only the intrasystem cash fluctuations, without any external shocks, may lead to systemic defaults, what may be a symptom of the self-organized criticality of the system. We also analyze the impact of different prudential regulations and market conditions on the interbank market resilience. We confirm that central bank's asset purchase programs, limiting the declines in government bond prices, can successfully stabilize bank's liquidity demand.

"McVea, H.",Central counterparties and sale and repurchase agreements: regulating financial markets in the light of yet another false dawn,"In this article it is argued that the burgeoning faith of policymakers and regulators in the ability of central counterpartiesCCPs’) to absorb both counterparty and collateral risk in sale and repurchase agreements’ (otherwise known as repos’) and, in turn, in helping to forestall contagion in the form of so-called repo runs’ is misplaced. In developing this contention, three major claims are advanced. First, for all their benefits, CCPs exhibit a major design flaw in as much as they are unable to diversify away market-wide systemic risk when counterparty failures become correlated as exemplified by the global financial crisisGFC’). Second, this design flaw is remarkably similar to the flaw which the modern trend towards market-based finance exhibits, again, as revealed during the GFC, and as persists in its more recent fund-based’ guise, and that this parallel cautions against viewing CCPs in an unduly favourable light.

"Hu, B.; Zheng, L.","China’s shadow banking system scale, risks and regulation: research from the perspective of non-traditional credit financing","Shadow banking in China is a popular yet controversial topic worldwide. Reforms are urgently needed as it is a complex system with many levels that involves products, institutions and markets. Shadow banks can be described as financial intermediaries that perform banking functions outside the traditional commercial banking system. Chinese researchers have defined shadow banking under three frameworks: regulation theory, risk theory and non-traditional credit theory. According to our research, shadow banking in China accounts for 19of total assets of the banking industry and is worth 27 trillion yuan. Shadow banking has plenty of systemic risks. The intrinsic non-traditional credit expansion mechanism (shadow banking business) of banking in the financial system has been identified as the major cause of the accumulation of systemic risks in finance. Despite its success and rapid development, shadow banking has also exposed the cracks in China’s financial system.

"Billio, M.; Frattarolo, L.; Gatfaoui, H.; Peretti, P.d.",Clustering in dynamic causal networks as a measure of systemic risk on the euro zone,"In this paper, we analyze the dynamic relationships between ten stock exchanges of the euro zone using Granger causal networks. Considering returns for which we allow the variance to follow a Markov-Switching GARCH or a Changing-Point GARCH process, we first show that over different periods, the topology of the network is highly unstable. In particular dynamic relationships vanish over very recent years. Then, expanding on this idea, we analyze patterns of information transmission within the network. Using rolling windows to study networks' topology in terms of information clustering, we find that the nodes' state changes continually. Moreover, the system exhibits periods of flickering in information tranmission. During these periods of flickering, the system also exhibits desynchronization in the information transmission process. These periods do precede tipping points or phase transitions on the market, especially before the global financial crisis, and can thus be used as early warnings. To our knowledge, this is the first time that flickering in information transmission is identified on financial markets, and that flickering is related to phase transitions",2016,2016-01-01,0,,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Topology (electrical circuits); Financial market; Variance (accounting); Stock exchange; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Financial crisis; Computer science; Cluster analysis,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mse/cesdoc/16046.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mse/cesdoc/16046.html,lens,009-245-057-250-071

This paper introduces a financial network model that combines the default and liquidity stress mechanisms into a double cascade mappingThe progress and eventual result of the crisis is obtained by iterating this mapping to its fixed point. Unlike simpler models, this model can therefore quantify how illiquidity or default of one bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the system. Large-network asymptotic cascade mapping formulas are derived that can be used for efficient network computations of the double cascade. Numerical experiments then demonstrate that these asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively with Monte Carlo for large finite networks, and quantitatively except when the initial system is placed in an exceptional knife-edge configuration. The experiments clearly support the main conclusion that when banks respond to liquidity stress by hoarding liquidity, then in the absence of asset fire sales, the level of defaults in a financial network is negatively related to the strength of bank liquidity hoarding and the eventual level of stress in the network.",2016,2016-07-29,14,International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Liquidity crisis; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Asset (economics); Accounting liquidity; Funding liquidity; Default; Network model; Monte Carlo method; Hoarding (economics); Cascade,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s0219024916500412,https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/10344/5550/1/Cellai_2016_double.pdf https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219024916500412 https://ideas.repec.org/a/wsi/ijtafx/v19y2016i05ns0219024916500412.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wsi:ijtafx:v:19:y:2016:i:05:n:s0219024916500412 https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/5550 https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6873 https://core.ac.uk/download/80547185.pdf,lens,000-741-809-866-182

In particular, we develop an efficient iterative proximal gradient algorithm for the non-smooth and non-strictly convex optimization problem incurred in our estimating procedure, and derive oracle bounds for the estimation error in a realistic situation where the sample size and number of iterative steps are both finite. The finite iteration analysis is particular useful when the matrix to be estimated is big and the computational cost is high.

"Woods, M.",Financial stability models of the irishbanking sector: deposit flows andproperty price dynamics,"Since the global financial crisis, there has been renewed focus on the analysis of sys- temic risk. Systemic risk refers to possibility that vulnerabilities across the financial system and between the financial system and the real economy will be triggered. As a result, intermediation activities may be curtailed and a financial crisis may occur. There are a number of aspects to systemic risk and related financial stability analy- sis. First, imbalances and risk can accumulate in both the financial system and in the composition of economic activity during an economic upswing, due to either adverse incentives or myopia by economic agents. Second, macro-financial linkages and conta- gion channels between financial intermediaries not only amplify potential risk during the boom period, but also exacerbate the economic impact when the cycle turns, or if there is an adverse shock. This thesis focuses on two current issues in financial stabil- ity research for the banking sector, namely the analysis of bank funding risk during a financial crisis and the detection of unsustainable property price movements. Funding risk and asset price bubbles, particularly in the commercial real estate market played a significant role in the origins of both the Irish and the global financial crisis. Across three chapters, this thesis presents original research on these topics using Irish data as a statistical example. Chapter one examines the determinants of weekly corporate deposit levels in Irish banks over the period March 2009 to August 2010. This sample includes the early stages of the Irish banking crisis, which began in 2008. The global financial crisis resulted in Irish banks experiencing more acute funding dificulties than institutions elsewhere. Using a unique high-frequency database and drawing on both the financial crisis and market discipline literature, the sensitivity of corporate depositors to move- ments in both idiosyncratic and systemic risk factors is tested. There is statistical evidence that measures of risk for the Irish banking sector such as implied ratings and credit default swap spreads can explain corporate deposit levels over the sample, val- idating the market discipline hypothesis. These further provide an empirical link between counter-party credit risk and bank funding risks. Additionally, tensions in European inter-bank markets are found to negatively impact corporate deposits indicating contagion channels between funding markets during periods of systemic stress. The empirical relationship between daily corporate and retail deposits is also examined. Although retail deposit flows move in the same direction as corporate de- posits, retail deposits appear to exhibit relatively higher inertia up to August 2010. Chapter one has been re-drafted from a co-authored policy-orientated research paper with Kieran McQuinn which is available as a Central Bank of Ireland Research Tech- nical Paper (No.2 12) entitled ""Modelling the corporate deposits of Irish financial institutions: 2009-2010"". Expanding the dataset to early-2014, chapter two models the dynamic behaviour of weekly customer deposits (i.e., both retail and corporate) held with Irish banks over the period March 2009 to end-December 2013 using an ARDL(1,1)GARCH(1,1) framework. Over the sample, which covers the Irish systemic banking crisis, weekly customer deposit flows are found to respond to measures of banking sector and sovereign risk which is consistent with the theory of market discipline among de- positors. Although the data cover resident and non-resident depositors, idiosyncratic and Irish-specific risk factors seem to have more explanatory power for deposit growth. Indicators of general stress in international financial markets are found to be statisti- cally insignificant. Once market-based risk factors are included in the model, no direct macro-economic infuence is found. Over the sample, statistical evidence of a regime shift is found, with deposits switching from a high variance regime to a low variance regime with the onset of an EU ECB IMF Programme of assistance for Ireland in early-December 2010. Interestingly, evidence of a GARCH-in-Mean effect indicates that the conditional variance of customer deposits negatively affects deposit growth rates over the sample. An adverse reaction to risk as proxied by the conditional volatility would be consistent with fight-to-quality theories of deposit behaviour. Chapter three analyses price developments in the Irish commercial property mar- ket over the period 1985Q1 to 2012Q4 using time-series techniques. First, three dif- ferent statistical approaches are used to test if prices can be explained by fundamental determinants such as income, interest rates and credit. Evidence of some deviations between actual and fundamental prices over the sample period is found. Second, two popular models of price misalignment from the stock price literature are used to test whether these estimated misalignments between actual prices and fundamentals (i.e., non-fundamental prices) suggest that there is an irrational fad or a rational bubble in Irish commercial property prices over the period under study. To distinguish between these two models, regime switching methodology is used. The study funds evidence of a number of periods where commercial property prices deviate from fundamentally determined values for a sustained period. The periods of estimated misalignment are found to be broadly consistent across the various approaches. In testing between a rational bubble and the irrational fad hypothesis, evidence of regime shifts over the sample provide some support for the presence of a bubble. However, the point es- timates of expected returns in each regime are not fully in-line with the theoretical predictions of the rational bubble theory. Therefore, the are not conclusive in favour of the rational bubble hypothesis.",2016,2016-01-01,0,,,Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Financial crisis; Market discipline; Credit default swap; Financial risk management; Financial intermediary; Financial system; Mark to model,http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/7124/,http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/7124/ https://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/7124/,lens,005-619-313-741-83X

"Abrol, S.; Chesir, B.; Mehta, N.","High frequency trading and US stock market microstructure: A study of interactions betweencomplexities, risks and strategies residing ins equity market microstructure","We examine the conditions, complexities and risks of a fragmented market microstructure to contextualize the role of algorithmic and high frequency trading in the US equity markets. The establishment of a national market system and Regulation NMS was meant to promote competition, recognizing the evolution and changing dynamics introduced by technological innovation. This evolution and governing rule set has had many positive effects in terms of competition, fee compression, tighter spread potential and volumes. Our paper identifies certain unintended consequences and complexities of the national market system including fragmentation, sub second quoting and trading, complex order types, data asymmetry, technological innovation, unique strategies and the algorithms that power them. When acting in concert, these complexities give rise to opportunities as well as emerging risks. This high-speed system can be unstable and susceptible to inherent conflicts of interest, market abuse and price shocks. These shocks can be amplified by positive feedback loops accelerating single stock declines and also posing systemic risks in time scales beyond real-time physical human comprehension and reaction times. Furthermore they can produce contagion, which we refer to as Flash Splashes’ caused by rapid withdrawals and injections of liquidity in increasingly linked asset classes, indices, sectors and global liquidity pools. High frequency trading strategies can be both passive and aggressive and usually display risk averse and low inventory characteristics. These strategies leverage fragmentation as they create or capture informational asymmetries. They interact directly with sell side algorithms that can hide intentions, hunt liquidity and sweep the order book. These interactions create market dynamics that can benefit and challenge anyone exposed to US equity markets. Every market participant has a risk profile unique to their strategy and and while regulations will be enriched or revised and certain unfair practices eliminated great attention should be paid to understanding modern high speed trading risks and both the positive and negative impacts on all stakeholders. We have examined the regulations, complexities and risks to bring clarity and understanding to the current trading ecosystem for its users.",2016,2016-04-21,8,"Financial Markets, Institutions & Instruments",,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Market system; Market liquidity; High-frequency trading; Regulation NMS; Stock market; Industrial organization; Market microstructure; Algorithmic trading,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fmii.12068,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fmii.12068/abstract https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fmii.12068 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/FMII_FMII12068.pdf?abstractid=2768460&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2768460 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/FMII_FMII12068.pdf?abstractid=2768460&mirid=1&type=2,lens,002-110-301-200-672
"Burkholz, R.; Garas, A.; Schweitzer, F.",How damage diversification can reduce systemic risk,"We study the influence of risk diversification on cascading failures in weighted complex networks, where weighted directed links represent exposures between nodes. These weights result from different diversification strategies and their adjustment allows us to reduce systemic risk significantly by topological means. As an example, we contrast a classical exposure diversification (ED) approach with a damage diversification (DD) variant. The latter reduces the loss that the failure of high degree nodes generally inflict to their network neighbors and thus hampers the cascade amplification. To quantify the final cascade size and obtain ourwe develop a branching process approximation taking into account that inflicted losses cannot only depend on properties of the exposed, but also of the failing node. This analytic extension is a natural consequence of the paradigm shift from individual to system safety.

"Avilova, I.; Naumov, A.; Shchenyatskaya, M.A.",Improving the economic efficiency of construction investments by means of technological risks management,"The widely used and well-researched tool in investment analysis is the net present value estimation, based on discounting of cash flows. However, it has been often criticized because risks-adjustment of discount rate with various risk premiumsThe main mistake is considering discount rate as an argument, able to have another economic sense, than the possible alternative earning capacity of reinvestment assets. The account of any risks of the investments should be carried out by adjusting the values of cash flows directly, by means of various probabilistic and risky facients, obtained by the statistical processing of the projects’ data implemented by considered contractor. In this regard we suggest to abandon the practice of taking the investment risks into account by means of discount rate, but to use for this purpose the correcting risky facients of the amount of the cash flows. The larger part of construction investment risks are directly connected with the construction works, i.e. technorisksThe technique presented at paper implements the systemic risk management approaches by multilevel management of technorisks, including monitoring of a contractor activity, determination of risky facients and adjusting of the net present value. It would allow the economically and statistically substantiated determination, ranging and control of the technorisks of a building contractor, and is going to be a useful analytical tool in improving the economic efficiency of investment in construction.",2016,2016-02-15,2,Journal of Fundamental and Applied Sciences,,Profitability index; Actuarial science; Economics; Cash flow; Operating cash flow; Return on investment; Investment (macroeconomics); Risk management; Discounting; Present value,http://jfas.info/index.php/jfas/article/download/1669/867,http://jfas.info/index.php/jfas/article/download/1669/867,lens,004-793-516-453-202

Disruption of this network may catalyse systemic risks affecting food, energy, water and environmental security (FEWES) worldwide. We describe the conceptual development, expansion and practical application of a stochastic version of the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), used to assess competition for land use between agriculture, bioenergy and forestry at regional and global scales. In the stochastic version of the model, systemic risks of various kinds are explicitly covered and can be analysed and mitigated in all their interactions. While traditional deterministic scenario analysis produces sets of scenario-dependent outcomes, stochastic GLOBIOM explicitly derives robust outcomes that leave the systems better-off, independently of which scenario applies. Stochastic GLOBIOM is formulated as a stochastic optimisation model that is critical for evaluating portfolios of robust interdependent decisions: ex-ante strategic decisions (production allocation, storage capacities) and ex-post adaptive (demand, trading, storage control) decisions. As an example, the model is applied to the question of optimal storage facilities, as buffers for production shortfalls, to meet regional and global FEWES requirements when extreme events occur. Expected shortfalls and storage capacities have a close relationship with Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) risk measures.

We examined the relationship between epistemic cultures in citizen science projects and learning potential related to matters of concern. We then developed a typology of purposes and a citizen science epistemic-cultures heuristic and mapped 56 projects in southern Africa using this framework. The purpose typology represents the range of knowledge-production purposes, ranging from laboratory science to social learning, whereas the epistemic-cultures typology is a relational representation of scientist and citizen participation and their approach to knowledge production. showed an iterative relationship between matters of fact and matters of concern across the projects the nexus of citizens’ engagement in knowledge-production activities varied. The knowledge-production purposes informed and shaped the epistemic cultures of all the sampled citizen science projects, which in turn influenced the potential for learning within each project. Through a historical review ofphases in a long-term river health-monitoring project, we found that it is possible to evolve the learning curve of citizen science projects. This evolution involved the development of scientific water monitoring tools, the parallel development of pedagogic practices supporting monitoring activities, and situated engagement around matters of concern within social activism leading to learning-led change. We conclude that such evolutionary processes serve to increase potential for learning and are necessary if citizen science is to contribute to wider restructuring of the epistemic culture of science under conditions of expanding social-ecological risk.

"He, Y.",Multivariate extreme value statistics for risk assessment,"This dissertation consists of three essays about statistical estimation and inference methods concerning extremal events and tail risks. The first essay establishes a natural, semi-parametric estimation procedure for the multivariate half-space depth-based extreme quantile region in arbitrary dimensions. In contrast to the failure of fully non-parametric approaches due to the scarcity of extremal observations, the good finite-sample performance of our extreme estimator is clearly demonstrated in simulation studies. The second essay extends this method to various depth functions, and, furthermore, establishes an asymptotic approximation theory of what-we-called (directed) logarithmic distance between our estimated and true quantile region. Confidence sets that asymptotically cover the quantile region or its complement, or both simultaneously, with a pre-specified probability can be therefore constructed under weak regular variation conditions. The finite-sample coverage probabilities of our asymptotic confidence sets are evaluated in a simulation study for the half-space depth and the projection depth. We use the procedures in both chapters for risk management by applying them to stock market returns. The third essay develops a statistical inference theory of a recently proposed tail risk measure. For regulators who are interested in monitoring these what-we-called relative risks of individual banks, we provide a jackknife empirical likelihood inference procedure based on the smoothed nonparametric estimation and a Wilks type of result. A simulation study and real-life data analysis show that the proposed relative risk measure is useful in monitoring systemic risk.",2016,2016-12-06,2,Research Papers in Economics,,Nonparametric statistics; Statistics; Quantile; Statistical inference; Extreme value theory; Econometrics; Estimator; Inference; Empirical likelihood; Mathematics; Jackknife resampling,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atilburguniversity.edu%3Apublications%2F119cc8b9-5198-41d6-a648-f72501cd4229,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atilburguniversity.edu%3Apublications%2F119cc8b9-5198-41d6-a648-f72501cd4229 https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/multivariate-extreme-value-statistics-for-risk-assessment https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/13548735/Thesis_HE_hyperlinkfixed_voor_PURE.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:tiu:tiutis:119cc8b9-5198-41d6-a648-f72501cd4229,lens,000-050-013-148-940

"Ellinas, C.; Allan, N.L.; Johansson, A.",Project systemic risk: application examples of a network model,"Projects are increasingly perceived as complex systems, yet little work has been done in developing methodologies that are theoretically grounded on complex systems theory. In response, this article argues the practical utility of a recently introduced model that draws on notions from Network Science (NS) a prominent domain in the study of complexity. Its utility is exemplified in the context of Project Management (PM), tackling two specific challenges: risk and conflict management. In the case of the former (risk), shifts in the susceptibility of a project to systemic risk (in the form of inter-linked failures) are identified. In the case of the latter (conflict), the effect of (sub) contractor activity in terms of variance and activity pattern to project systemic risk is assessed. To do so, numerical methods are developed and applied on an empirical dataset of widely-captured data (Gantt charts). In the context of the two challenges proposed, it is shown that: (a) the exposure of a project to systemic risk varies in a non-trivial manner as it evolves, at both micro and macro level (b) (sub) contractor activity substantially impacts the emergence of locally important tasks (i.e. tasks able to disrupt the operation of a (sub) contractor). From a theoretical perspective, this work initiates a dialogue between the two domains (PM and NS), potentially opening new ways of tackling long-lasting challenges of PM.",2016,2016-01-01,20,International Journal of Production Economics,,Network science; Systemic risk; Project management; Work (electrical); Process management; Variance (accounting); Conflict management; Context (language use); Computer science; Management science; Gantt chart,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.08.011,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/project-systemic-risk-application-examples-of-a-network-model https://core.ac.uk/display/96779613 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeproeco/v_3a182_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a50-62.htm https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/project-systemic-risk(52d01ea9-6fd3-4166-9613-f919fd93182e).html https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/89443982/IJPE_Ellinas.pdf https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/89443982/IJPE_Ellinas.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527316301906 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/proeco/v182y2016icp50-62.html https://core.ac.uk/download/96779613.pdf,lens,004-768-057-093-054
"Belloni, A.; Chen, M.; Chernozhukov, V.",Quantile graphical models: prediction and conditional independence with applications to financial risk management,"We propose Quantile Graphical Models (QGMs) to characterize predictive and conditional independence relationships within a set of random variables of interest. This framework is intended to quantify the dependence in non-Gaussian settings which are ubiquitous in many econometric applications. We consider two distinct QGMs. First, Condition Independence QGMs characterize conditional independence at each quantile index revealing the distributional dependence structure. Second, Predictive QGMs characterize the best linear predictor under asymmetric loss functions. Under Gaussianity these notions essentially coincide but non-Gaussian settings lead us to different models as prediction and conditional independence are fundamentally different properties. Combined the models complement the methods based on normal and nonparanormal distributions that study mean predictability and use covariance and precision matrices for conditional independence. We also propose estimators for each QGMs. The estimators are based on high-dimension techniques including (a continuum of) l1-penalized quantile regressions and low biased equations, which allows us to handle the potentially large number of variables. We build upon recent to obtain valid choice of the penalty parameters and rates of convergence. These are derived without any assumptions on the separation from zero and are uniformly valid across a wide-range of models. With the additional assumptions that the coefficients are well-separated from zero, we can consistently estimate the graph associated with the dependence structure by hard thresholding the proposed estimators. Further we show how QGM can be used to represent the tail interdependence of the variables which plays an important role in application concern with extreme events in opposition to average behavior. We show that the associated tail risk network can be used for measuring systemic risk contributions.

"Das, B.; Fasen, V.",Risk contagion under regular variation and asymptotic tail independence,"Risk contagion concerns any entity dealing with large scale risks. Suppose (X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A relevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of influence of high values ofon X. This can be measured in a variety of ways. In this paper, we study two such measures: the quantitymax(X-t,0)t called Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantityXt called Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of risk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance, insurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under the assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and asymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful model classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive the asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the thresholdtends to infinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in the models, MME and MES converge tounder very general conditions this reflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains significant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce an extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and MES for high thresholdswhere little data are available. We show that these estimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and real data sets.",2016,2016-03-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Consistency (statistics); Extrapolation; Systemic risk; Extreme value theory; Econometrics; Estimator; Scale (descriptive set theory); Mathematics; Independence (probability theory); Expected shortfall,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1603.09406.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1603.09406.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1603.09406 https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/arxpapers/1603.09406.htm,lens,005-611-749-084-256

"Healey, D.; Nicholls, R.",Should stability reign the consumer downside of foregone competition in retail banking markets,"Since the global financial crisis, policymakers and economic researchers internationally have highlighted the need for prudential regulation, simultaneously sidelining the importance of competition. However, competition is essential to consumer welfare, and the proposition that competition prejudices stability in financial services is not supported by cogent evidence. In fact, this article demonstrates that competition supports stability and that a failure to prioritize competition increases the likelihood and systemic importance of large financial firms, heightening systemic risk. Australia did not have a recession as a result of the global financial crisis, consequently the article uses Australia to provide a number of examples of the effects of the two policies. The Australian Government initiated two major reviews in 2014: the Financial System Inquiry and the Competition Policy Review.

"Madagascar, A.; Gautier, J.",Surliquidite risque de systeme et rationnement du credit dans un ped exemple des banques de depots a madagascar financial liberalisation and banking risks the case of commercial banks in madagascar,"This study analyses the reason why bank credit decreased in Madagascar in the late 90's, although the banking system was on a excess liquidity position. Three ex planations were found:A restrictive monetary policy has been established in order to make up for the inflationary impact of the exchange rate liberalisation. This monetary policy was mo nitored by the management of the monetary interest rates and by the increase of the obligatory reserves.Financial intermediary was and is still made difficult by a lack of information concerning potential customers. For these reasons, the banks' balance sheet has seen a rapid increase in non-performant credit in a recent past (up to 30% of total loans for the public banks).The degradation of the public' banks financial state certainly is the main cause of the credit crunch. The proportion of non performant credit in their balance sheet and the sum of deficits have caused negative equity. The increase of the systemic ri sk has led banks to accentuate their loan selection. Systemic risk was actually par tially unrealistic. The weakness of cross positions in balance sheets and the high de gree of liquidity of the private sector give to this sector a secure position. The banking system in Madagascar is dichotomous, indeed divided between a public sector in a state of virtual bankruptcy and a high profitable private sector. This dichotomy has caused ambiguous effect from the monetary policy. The private sector with an excess liquidity position makes profits on this policy, while the financial situation of the public sector suffers from important alterations.",2016,2016-01-01,0,,,Private sector; Monetary policy; Business; Public sector; Credit crunch; Balance sheet; Market liquidity; Negative equity; Financial intermediary; Financial system,,,lens,003-778-703-856-478

Empirical suggest that intra-industry linkages exist among insurance firms, although they are comparatively weaker than those in banking and real estate. Moreover, systemic risks arising from the effects of distress in other economic sectors are lower for insurance companies although not negligible.

We show that, by properly shifting financial exposures from one institution to another, a CDS market can be designed to rewire the network of interbank exposures in a way that makes it more resilient to insolvency cascades. A regulator can use information about the topology of the interbank network to devise a systemic insurance surcharge that is added to the CDS spread. CDS contracts are thus effectively penalized according to how much they contribute to increasing systemic risk. CDS contracts that decrease systemic risk remain untaxed.

"Ford, C.",Systemic risk regulation in comparative perspective,"This report succinctly compares, with tables and diagrams, the systemic risk regulatory regimes that have been put in place since 2008 in the US, the UK, the EU and Canada. It describes systemic risk as a problem of a different order from the kinds of investor protection and efficient market concerns that animate day-to-day securities and capital markets regulation. Because contemporary markets operate as systems, characterized by interconnectedness, unpredictability, and fast-moving, multiple-round contagion effects, responding to systemic risk demands a different regulatory structure and a separate set of tools. This report was prepared for the Department of Finance, Government of Canada in response to a constitutional challenge by Quebec to proposed federal legislation, the Capital Markets Stability Act, which would put in place a systemic risk regulatory regime with oversight over Canadian capital markets. It compares existing provincial securities regulatory regimes with the proposed regime, and with international standards and transnational regulatory structures. For non-Canadians, apart from the summaries above, the most interesting point may be that the proposed Canadian regime is structured to designate and regulate as systemically risky or important only benchmarks, products, and practices not institutions, no matter how large, nor financial market infrastructure, no matter how essential. This approach arguably covers the same ground but is more in line with the growing recognition that systemic risk operates primarily at the level of markets and products, not institutions. It would also avoid the need to designate institutions as too big to fail, e.g., under Dodd-Frank, or to designate investment funds (as opposed to the products they sell) as systemically important.",2016,2016-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Order (exchange); Financial market; Financial innovation; Too big to fail; European union; Market economy; Interconnectedness,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2798419,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2798419_code438397.pdf?abstractid=2798419&mirid=1 https://works.bepress.com/cristie-ford/3/ https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2798419 https://commons.allard.ubc.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=fac_pubs https://works.bepress.com/cristie-ford/3/download/ https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2798419 https://commons.allard.ubc.ca/fac_pubs/142/ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2798419,lens,002-461-175-671-258

"Golubovic, S.",The control function of the national bank of serbia,"The functioning of a modern economy cannot be conceived without activities of banks and non-banking financial institutions. As financial intermediaries, these institutions issue various financial instruments to mobilize and further allocate free financial funds in appropriate financial investments. By performing this function, financial institutions concurrently affect economic activity, economic structure, employment and macroeconomic stability. Due to their importance for economic relations in any country, most countries prescribe very strict requirements that must be fulfilled in order for an organization to perform financial intermediation activities. These conditions are most often related to the specific requirements regarding activities of financial institutions and their establishment, balance sheet, and requirements in terms of capital adequacy. An integral part of the financial sector regulation is definition of the prudential supervision framework (an effective system of supervision, precisely defined competences of the bodies involved in the supervision, their operational independence, transparency, proceedings for the control of solvency and legality of financial institutions' activities) and the implementation of corrective and coercive measures. The paper analyzes the control function of the National Bank of Serbia which, in addition to monitoring and controlling the banking sector, exercises the supervision and control of non-banking financial institutions.

"Han, H.; Linton, O.; Oka, T.; Whang, Y.",The cross-quantilogram: measuring quantile dependence and testing directional predictability between time series,"This paper proposes the cross-quantilogram to measure the quantile dependence between two time series. We apply it to test the hypothesis that one time series has no directional predictability to another time series. We establish the asymptotic distribution of the cross quantilogram and the corresponding test statistic. The limiting distributions depend on nuisance parameters. To construct consistent confidence intervals we employ the stationary bootstrap procedure we show the consistency of this bootstrap. Also, we consider the self-normalized approach, which is shown to be asymptotically pivotal under the null hypothesis of no predictability. We provide simulation studies and two empirical applications. First, we use the cross-quantilogram to detect predictability from stock variance to excess stock return.

The resulting overall ranking is less affected by estimation uncertainty and model risk. We apply our methodology to disentangle the common signal and the idiosyncratic components from a selection of key systemic risk rankings that have been proposed recently. We use a sample of 113 listed financial sector firms in the European Union over the period 2002 2013. The implied ranking from the principal components is less volatile than most individual risk rankings and leads to less turnover among the top ranked institutions. We also find that price-based rankings and fundamentals-based rankings deviated substantially and for a prolonged time in the period leading up to the financial crisis.

Following the financial crisis there has been a raft of EU financial regulation, often with extraterritorial reach. The Alternative Investment Fund Manager’s Directive and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation will be considered in detail, after which consideration of the evidence provided by European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in relation to the functioning of the AIFMD passport within the EU and the extension of the AIFMD passport outside the EU will be outlined. Despite the lack of evidence to suggest that the parallel banking system either caused or exacerbated the financial crisis, regulation of hedge and private equity funds and over the counter derivatives intensified following 2009 and access to the European markets could be severely curtailed by the extraterritorial imposition of EU regulations. Ostensibly the new regulations have been designed to prevent systemic risk spreading to the system from poorly regulated third countries, and to mark a departure from home state control. However, having examined the Jersey and Guernsey assessments, it will be argued that the prevention of systemic risk is no longer the main concern when assessing equivalent regimes, where market access and reciprocity are key. ESMA is also shown to have considerable power in determining whether equivalence is determined against rules or principles.",2016,2016-01-01,0,,,Alternative investment; Business; Systemic risk; Private equity fund; Investment management; Financial instrument; Financial market; European union; Financial regulation; Financial system,https://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/6848/,https://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/6848/,lens,010-434-238-645-484

"Jin, X.; Simone, F.N.D.",Tracking changes in the intensity of financial sector's systemic risk,"This study provides the first available estimates of systemic risk in the financial sector comprising the banking and investment fund industries during 2009Q4 2015Q4. Systemic risk is measured in three forms: as risk common to the financial sector as contagion within the financial sector and as the build up of financial sector's vulnerabilities over time, which may unravel in a disorderly manner. The methodology models the financial sector components' default dependence statistically and captures the time varying non-linearities and feedback effects typical of financial markets. In addition, the study estimates the common components of the financial sector's default measures and by identifying the macro-financial variables most closely associated with them, it provides useful input into the formulation of macro prudential policy. The main suggest that: (1) interdependence in the financial sector decreased in the first three years of the sample, but rose again later coinciding with ECB's references to increased search for yield in the financial sector. (2) Investment funds are a more important source of contagion to banks than the other way round, and this is more the case for European banking groups than for Luxembourg banks. (3) For tracking the growth of vulnerabilities over time, it is better to monitor the most vulnerable part of the financial sector because the common components of systemic risk measures tend to lead these measures.",2016,2016-10-01,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Financial analysis; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Indirect finance; Financial risk management; Financial regulation; Financial system; Financial risk; Financial ratio,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcl/bclwop/bclwp102.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/bcl/bclwop/bclwp102.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bcl:bclwop:bclwp102,lens,010-052-387-273-748

Systemic risk factors for CRVO include age older than 55 years as well as cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Glaucoma is associated with CRVO because of increased vulnerability of the central retinal vein at the lamina cribosa. Clinically, CRVOs are classified as nonischemic versus ischemic based on visual acuity, afferent pupillary defect status, and fluorescein angiography. The prognoses for ischemic versus nonischemic CRVO are different, and there are various degrees of ischemia in CRVO. This chapter illustrates the heterogeneous patterns of retinal nonperfusion in CRVO using wide-field fluorescein angiography.

It argues that the ability to achieve this is not determined solely by the law relating to criminal procedure.

This is accomplished through a reduction of systemic risk, which refers to a risk that could be greater than the sum of the risks of the individual system constituents. Using network analysis, it is shown that the explicit socio-physical approach yields meaningful qualitative and quantitative differences when compared with approaches that focus on the social and physical views in isolation. The benefits of this proposed approach are illustrated on a case study using clustering analysis and a proof-of-concept simulation.

"Masys, A.J.; Yee, E.; Vallerand, A.","Black swans’, Dragon kings’ and beyond: towards predictability and suppression of extreme all-hazards events through modeling and simulation","Shocks to regional, national and global systems stemming from natural or man-made hazards can have dramatic implications. Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience. Black Swans’ represent the unpredictable. They represent our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, 2007). A Black Swan’ is described by Taleb (2007) as that which is an outlier, that which is outside the realm of regular expectations which carries with it an extreme impact such as natural disasters, market crashes, catastrophic failure of complex socio-technical systems and terrorist events such as11. Sornette (IntTerraspace Sci Eng 2(1):1 18, 2009) identifies a different class of extreme events (outliers) that he calls Dragon Kings’. Sornette (2009) argues that Dragon Kings may have properties that make them not only identifiable in real time but also predictable. The evolving science on complexity (and, more specifically, on complex networks) and on resilience suggest that modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, and financial events. Furthermore, the science of complex networks is developing rapidly and has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of complexity, potentially leading to innovative methods for the prediction of emergent behavior on natural and technological networks, as well as specific strategies for designing networks that are more resistant (resilient) to both failure and attack. Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible Dragon-King type of low probability extremely high consequence extreme events, as well as from the utilization of recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency. This chapter contributes to the discourse on Dragon Kings arguing for continued and concerted efforts to explore this domain.",2015,2015-09-15,4,Applications of Systems Thinking and Soft Operations Research in Managing Complexity,,Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Natural disaster; Vulnerability; Black swan theory; Extreme weather; Geography; Natural hazard; Genealogy; Emergency management,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21106-0_7,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-21106-0_7.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21106-0_7/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21106-0_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21106-0_7,lens,005-788-696-931-047

"Wendt, F.",Central counterparties addressing their too important to fail nature,"Central counterparties (CCPs) can offer significant benefits to a market. However, CCPs are also highly interconnected with financial institutions and markets and therefore too important to fail. The increased volumes cleared through CCPs and their increasing global scope, in particular in the OTC derivatives market, make it even more important that systemic risks related to CCPs are managed. This paper argues that the current set of international policy measures does partly address these risks, but that alternative policy measures are needed to reduce remaining systemic risks. For example, the paper recommends network analysis to be conducted by CCPs and authorities to gauge potential losses and suggests a common international approach to central bank services to help reduce the dependency of CCPs on services provided by commercial banks.",2015,2015-01-27,2,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Interdependence; Financial market; Scope (project management); Central bank; Interconnectedness; Derivatives market,http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:imf:imfwpa:15/21,http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:imf:imfwpa:15/21,lens,002-278-862-300-146

Their total land area exceeds the land area of Mexico or Indonesia, their total gross domestic product (in current US dollars) is between those products of Mexico and Indonesia, and their total population is higher than population of the Russian Federation or Japan. Some Eastern European states are in the world top-five producers of corn, rye, oat, triticale, buckwheat, potato, carrot, turnip, apple, gooseberry, raspberry, blueberry, plum, currant, milk (sheep), honey, flax, and other agricultural goods. It is found the agricultural production value of Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine has higher efficiency (in the terms of water and energy use) than that of Belarus, Moldova, Poland, and Hungary. Therefore, it was expected the regions of Ukraine bordering with Romania and Slovakia are of the highest agricultural productivity. This hypothesis is confirmed by the data of capital and labor use as well as the data of agricultural production value. At the lack of energy resources, in Ukraine water appears to be a critical agricultural production factor. Moreover, the regions of Ukraine experiencing a water deficit happened to be the most vulnerable ones substantiating the well-known hypothesis on growing role of water resources for sustainable development. Because a water demand depends on the weather conditions and climate changes, the robust land-use decisions are to be developed in order to contribute to the world food security. For instance, Ukraine is transforming from a global breadbasket to a global foodbasket attracting significant investments to food production and export.

"Ramsay, B.A.; Sarlin, P.",Ending over-lending: assessing systemic risk with debt to cash flow,"This paper introduces the ratio of debt to cash flow (D CF) of nations and their economic sectors to macroprudential analysis, particularly as an indicator of systemic risk and vulnerabilities. While leverage is oftentimes linked to the vulnerability of a nation, the stock of total debt and the flow of gross savings is a less explored measure. Cash flows certainly have a well-known connection to corporations' ability to service debt. This paper investigates whether theCF provides a means for understanding systemic risks. For a panel of 33 nations, we explore historicCF trends and apply the same procedure to economic sectors. In terms of an early-warning indicator, we show that theCF ratio provides a useful additional measure of vulnerability to systemic banking and sovereign crises, relative to more conventional indicators. As a conceptual framework, the assessment of financial stability is arranged for presentation within four vulnerability zones and exemplified with a number of illustrative case studies.

This formed the purpose of the research the identifying of the opportunities for intensification of Russia’s participation in the regional integration process through a comparative analysis of the development of the foreign trade relations of the Russian regions in the period from 2000 to the present time. Analysis of interregional cooperation of Russian regions showed that there is a trade deficit in most regions. In most regions there is focus on the export of resources and irrational structure of imports, which promotes the preservation of the inertial scenario of expansion of foreign economic activity of the regions and the country as a whole. The growth of exports is implementedat higher ratescompared to the growth of imports. Consequently, Russian foreign trade, which had a stable export orientation previously, has become even more export-oriented. Russian Federation despite the status of a major industrial power has actually become a mono-cultural exporter. With such high concentration of exports in a small group of commodities and materials to Russia the scope of maneuver into the foreign economic relations significantly narrows and its vulnerability against the negative changes in the world conjuncture greatly increases. In addition, high deterioration of external conjuncture of the energy export was a cause of a number of serious systemic risks for domestic economy and finally may be a cause of deep economic crisis.",2015,2015-05-22,0,Asian Social Science,,Systemic risk; International trade; Economics; Vulnerability; Balance of trade; State (polity); Regional integration; Foreign trade policy; High concentration; Russian federation,http://dx.doi.org/10.5539/ass.v11n14p259,https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ass/article/download/49128/26376 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3722894031/evaluation-of-russian-foreign-trade-activities-from https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ass/article/view/49128/0,lens,001-206-651-319-710
"Thanoon, M.A.",External shocks to and volatility of economic growth in asain-6: A dynamic panel 1991-2011,"The global economy has recently been characterised by a string of new style financial crises that plunged a number of rapidly growing and successful economies in the world into financial chaos and economic collapse. The challenge of reconciling international mobility with domestic economic stability and developmental priorities has now emerged as the most pressing and controversial topic in international economies and policymaking. At the heart of this new policy focus is a renewed emphasis on the conventional wisdom about the need to treat foreign direct investment (FDI) flows separately from other forms of capital flows (short run and long run debt) in designing national policies to monitor capital flows. There are many things that went wrong for the countries caught up in the Asian crises of 1997, 2002 and 2008, but of the myriad causes two clear central problems can be identified- the fatal combination of large and volatile international capital inflows, interacting with fragile domestic financial sectors. In particular, the Asian financial crisis has created confusion about the role of foreign capital in the development of Asia. Since the crisis, there has been heated debate on how beneficial foreign capital is in promoting economic growth, given that it also created systemic risks that were a key to the Asian financial crisis. This paper contributes to the debate by assessing the role of foreign capital inflows and outflows in generating sustainable savings and growth prior to and during the crisis. Though there has been a large number of studies of foreign capital inflows, few have gone beyond qualitative assertions regarding FDI, long and short term debt, savings and growth. This study makes some attempt at rectifying this gap by quantifying the above issue using the dynamic panel modelling of six Asian countries over and during the crisis (1991-2011). The main conclusion of this article is that sudden decreases of foreign capital inflows and global crisis explain most of the fluctuation in the Asian annual growth rates since 1990s.",2015,2015-01-01,0,,,Debt; Systemic risk; Economics; International economics; Short run; Economic collapse; Financial crisis; Foreign direct investment; Financial capital; Economic stability,https://www.uob.edu.bh/uob__files/761/vol%202-1/JIE%2069-85.pdf,https://www.uob.edu.bh/uob__files/761/vol%202-1/JIE%2069-85.pdf,lens,003-695-067-375-847

"Azangue, A.F.",Financial stability and inflation stabilization,"The 2008 2009 global financial crisis has revived the debate on the concern for financial stability in themonetary policy-making, stressing the need to reconsider the role of central banks in ensuring financialstability. The crisis has also pointed some flaws in the existing (micro) prudential regulation and therelevance to move toward a broader regulatory framework aiming to prevent systemic risk. This thesis isbuilt upon these issues. It investigates the extent to which financial stability may be of particular concernin a context where the main monetary policy is inflation stabilization (typically, in an inflationtargeting regime IT ). It further assesses how the macroprudential framework and monetary policy canbe articulated to ensure the best outcome in terms of macroeconomic and financial stability (Chapter I).The derived from this work suggest that, faced with the recent global financial turmoil,inflation targeting central banks have been more able to mitigate the shock, certainly thanks to higherpolicy credibility (Chapter II). However, we evidence that IT countries (especially in EMEs) are morefinancially vulnerable than their non-IT counterparts, despite central banks’ response to financial risks(Chapter III). Following the latter conclusion, we investigate more closely the effectiveness of the leaningagainst the wind strategy. We show that such a policy response generates trade-offs between thefinancial and macroeconomic stabilityof the monetary authorities. The best stabilizationoutcome is achieved when an effective macroprudential framework is implemented, combined withhigher central bank’s concern with financial risks (Chapter IV). Furthermore, we show that in EMEsITers, foreign exchange interventions are used to mitigate their financial vulnerability to external shocks,although the IT regime requires a fully floating exchange rate regime (Chapter V).",2015,2015-05-19,0,,,Monetary policy; Systemic risk; Economics; International economics; Inflation targeting; Financial crisis; Floating exchange rate; Shock (economics); Monetary economics; Inflation; Financial risk,https://www.theses.fr/2015ORLE0503,https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01288393/document https://www.theses.fr/2015ORLE0503 https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01288393,lens,007-172-887-863-638

"Swagel, P.","Legal, political, and institutional constraints on the financial crisis policy response","As the financial crisis manifested itself and peaked in 2007 and 2008, the response of US policymakers and regulators was shaped in important ways by legal and political constraints. Policymakers lacked certain legal authorities that would have been useful for addressing the crisis, notably to use public capital to stabilize the banking sector or to deal with the failure of large financial firms such as insurance companies and investment banks that were outside the scope of bank regulators' authority to resolve deposit-taking commercial banks. Legal constraints were keenly felt at the US Department of the Treasury, whereserved as a senior official from December 2006 to January 2009. Treasury had virtually no emergency economic authority at the onset of the crisis in 2007, with the exception of the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, which was intended for use in exchange rate interventions. As the systemic risks of the financial crisis became apparent, the initial policy response largely fell to the Federal Reserve, which had the authority to act under emergency circumstances. There will inevitably be another financial crisis, and the response will be shaped by both the lessons learned from recent history and the statutory and political changes in the wake of the crisis. The paper thus concludes by discussing changes in constraints since the crisis, with a focus on two developments: 1) the political reality that there will not in the near future be another wide-ranging grant of fiscal authority as was given with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and 2) the new legal authorities provided in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank law.",2015,2015-05-01,30,Journal of Economic Perspectives,,Finance; Economic policy; Systemic risk; Investment banking; Statutory law; Economics; Exchange rate; Consumer Protection Act; Financial crisis; Treasury; Troubled Asset Relief Program,http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jep.29.2.107,https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v29y2015i2p107-22.html https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.29.2.107 https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.2.107 https://www.aeaweb.org/atypon.php?return_to=/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.2.107 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:aea:jecper:v:29:y:2015:i:2:p:107-22 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5158261 https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/citedby/10.1257/jep.29.2.107 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:aea:jecper:v:29:y:2015:i:2:p:107-22 http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.2.107,lens,007-824-198-277-124

"Mokal, R.","Liquidity, systemic risk, and the bankruptcy treatment of financial contracts","Parties to repos, and to swaps and other derivatives are accorded privileged treatment under the bankruptcy laws of several dozen countries. Several key international best practice standards urge legislators in other jurisdictions to provide likewise. The beneficiaries of these privileges are solvent counterparties enabled, unimpeded by bankruptcy moratoria, to implement close-out netting arrangements and to dispose of collateral. The purported rationale is mitigation of systemic risk.Taking a broad international perspective, this Article explores the domino contagion view of distress that motivates the privileges. This view derives from the outdated microprudential understanding of systemic risk, and is theoretically flawed and empirically false. Drawing instead on the macroprudential approach, the Article argues that the elements of the broad close-out netting process contractual termination, marked-to-market valuation, netting, and unimpeded collateral disposals exacerbate systemic risk by increasing common exposures to risk, systemic uncertainty, procyclicality, and leverage, while reducing lending standards, collateral utilization, and regulatory capital buffers.A recent attempt to provide a new rationale for financial contract privileges highlights their contribution to the exponentiation of liquidity. This Article shows that the privileges diminish the liquidity of markets and financial institutions alike. What they exponentiate is froth. This rather unfamiliar label describes the all too familiar state in which assets are persistently and or progressively overvalued and in which negative net-value projects obtain funding. The exponentiation of froth the textbook recipe for systemic crises should only be attractive to financial institution decision makers whose remuneration perversely tracks the riskiness of their institutions.The Article also throws new light on the international spread of financial contract privileges. It expands on existing literature by mapping the path-dependent process by which national legislators and international standard setters were persuaded as to the alleged value of these privileges. It illustrates the key mechanisms by which any consideration of the costs of the privileges was precluded.The Article concludes by rebutting the argument that bankruptcy law should not play any role in systemic risk mitigation, and by consolidating proposals to reform bankruptcy laws to protect the social welfare-enhancing features of financial contracts without encouraging systemic risk, value destruction, or unfairness.",2015,2015-11-23,0,Social Science Research Network,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Market liquidity; Valuation (finance); Collateral; Financial institution; Capital requirement; Bankruptcy; Leverage (finance),https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2694285,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2694285,lens,009-840-516-950-031
"Sandhu, R.; Georgiou, T.T.; Tannenbaum, A.","Market fragility, systemic risk, and ricci curvature","Measuring systemic risk or fragility of financial systems is a ubiquitous task of fundamental importance in analyzing market efficiency, portfolio allocation, and containment of financial contagions. Recent attempts have shown that representing such systems as a weighted graph characterizing the complex web of interacting agents over some information flow (e.g., debt, stock returns, shareholder ownership) may provide certain keen insights. Here, we show that fragility, or the ability of system to be prone to failures in the face of random perturbations, is negatively correlated with geometric notion of Ricci curvature. The key ingredient relating fragility and curvature is entropy. As a proof of concept, we examine returns from a set of stocks comprising theP 500 over a 15 year span to show that financial crashes are more robust compared to normal ""business as usual"" fragile market behaviori.e., Ricci curvature is a ""crash hallmark."" Perhaps more importantly, this work lays the foundation of understanding of how to design systems and policy regulations in a manner that can combat financial instabilities exposed during the 2007-2008 crisis.",2015,2015-05-01,13,Research Papers in Economics,,Financial economics; Information flow (information theory); Debt; Shareholder; Ricci curvature; Systemic risk; Economics; Curvature; Stock (geology); Fragility,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1505.05182.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1505.05182.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1505.05182,lens,006-543-886-876-254
"Molins, J.; Vives, E.",Model risk on credit risk,"This paper develops the Jungle model in a credit portfolio framework. The Jungle model is able to model credit contagion, produce doubly-peaked probability distributions for the total default loss and endogenously generate quasi phase transitions, potentially leading to systemic credit events which happen unexpectedly and without an underlying single cause. We show the Jungle model provides the optimal probability distribution for credit losses, under some reasonable empirical constraints. The Dandelion model, a particular case of the Jungle model, is presented, motivated and exactly solved. The Dandelion model provides an explicit example of doubly-peaked probability distribution for the credit losses. The Diamond model, another instance of the Jungle model, experiences the so called quasi phase transitions in particular, both the U.S. subprime and the European sovereign crises are shown to be potential examples of quasi phase transitions. We argue the three known sources of default clustering (contagion, macroeconomic risk factors and frailty) can be understood under the unifying framework of contagion. We suggest how the Jungle model is able to explain a series of empirical stylized facts in credit portfolios, hard to reconcile by some standard credit portfolio models. We show the Jungle model can handle inhomogeneous portfolios with state-dependent recovery rates. We look at model risk in a credit risk framework under the Jungle model, especially in relation to systemic risks posed by doubly-peaked distributions and quasi phase transitions.",2015,2015-12-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Systemic risk; Probability distribution; Econometrics; Economics; Credit risk; Diamond model; Jungle; Model risk; Stylized fact; Cluster analysis,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1502.06984,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:arx:papers:1502.06984 https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/1502.06984.html,lens,008-161-793-313-072

"Slots, J.","Periodontal herpesviruses: prevalence, pathogenicity, systemic risk","Periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease characterized by the loss of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Herpesviruses are frequent inhabitants of periodontitis lesions, and the periodontopathogenicity of these viruses is the topic of this review. In 26 recent studies from 15 countries, subgingival cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex virus type 1, respectively, yielded median prevalences of 49%, 45% and 63% in aggressive periodontitis, 40%, 32% and 45% in chronic periodontitis, and 3%, 7% and 12% in healthy periodontium. An active herpesvirus infection of the periodontium exhibits site specificity, is a potent stimulant of cellular immunity, may cause upgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria and tends to be related to disease-active periodontitis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by the herpesvirus infection may activate matrix metalloproteinases and osteoclasts, leading to breakdown of the tooth-supportive tissues. The notion that a co-infection of herpesviruses and specific bacteria causes periodontitis provides a plausible etiopathogenic explanation for the disease. Moreover, herpesvirus virions from periodontal sites may dislodge into saliva or enter the systemic circulation and cause diseases beyond the periodontium. Periodontal treatment can diminish significantly the periodontal load of herpesviruses, which may lower the incidence and magnitude of herpesvirus dissemination within and between individuals, and subsequently the risk of acquiring a variety of medical diseases. Novel and more effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis and related diseases may depend on a better understanding of the herpesvirus-bacteria-immune response axis.",2015,2015-08-07,91,Periodontology 2000,"aggressive periodontitis/immunology; bacterial infections/complications; chronic periodontitis/immunology; cytokines/physiology; herpesviridae infections/complications; herpesviridae/pathogenicity; humans; immunity, cellular; periodontium/immunology; risk factors",Immunology; Virus; Cytomegalovirus; Periodontium; Aggressive periodontitis; Chronic periodontitis; Periodontitis; Cellular immunity; Periodontal fiber; Medicine,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/prd.12085,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/prd.12085 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26252400/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26252400 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26252400,lens,001-534-396-226-682
"Helm, P.",Risk and resilience: strategies for security,"Traditional approaches to security and safety are being challenged by ever-increasing complexity in today's socio-economic systems. New vulnerabilities are arising for many reasons: demographic shifts, trans-boundary networks, modern business practices, new systemic risks, and reliance on closely coupled infrastructure systems, among others. In such circumstances there needs to be greater allowance for uncertainty, and a different balance of proactive and reactive risk management. Decision-makers in both governments and the private sector require more comprehensive strategies that combine active management of specific risks with enhancement of generic resilience in society. Security will depend increasingly on community attributes such as social capital, informal communication networks, and organisational culture.

In the case of economic and financial networks, privacy issues severely limit the information that can be accessed and, as a consequence, the possibility of correctly estimating the resilience of these systems to events such as financial shocks, crises and cascade failures. Here we present an innovative method to reconstruct the structure of such partially-accessible systems, based on the knowledge of intrinsic node-specific properties and of the number of connections of only a limited subset of nodes. This information is used to calibrate an inference procedure based on fundamental concepts derived from statistical physics, which allows to generate ensembles of directed weighted networks intended to represent the real system, so that the real network properties can be estimated with their average values within the ensemble. Here we test the method both on synthetic and empirical networks, focusing on the properties that are commonly used to measure systemic risk.

"Bruyckere, V.D.",Systemic risk rankings and network centrality in the european banking sector,"This paper presents a methodology to calculate the Systemic Risk Ranking of financial institutions in the European banking sector using publicly available information. The pro- posed model makes use of the network structure of financial institutions by including the stock return series of all listed banks in the financial system. Furthermore, a wide set of common risk factors (macroeconomic risk factors, sovereign risk, financial risk and housing price risk) is included to allow these factors to affect the banks. The model uses Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) of Locally Weighted Regression models (LOESS), i.e. BMA-LOESS. The network structure of the financial sector is analysed by computing measures of network centrality (degree, closeness and betweenness) and it is shown that this information can be used to provide measures of the systemic importance of institutions. Using data from 2005 (2nd quarter) to 2013 (3rd quarter), this paper provides further insight into the time-varying importance of risk factors and it is shown that the model produces superior conditional out-of-sample forecasts (i.e. projections) than a classical linear Bayesian multi-factor model.

"Aymanns, C.; Caccioli, F.; Farmer, J.D.; Tan, V.W.C.",Taming the basel leverage cycle,"Effective risk control must make a tradeoff between the microprudential risk of exogenous shocks to individual institutions and the macroprudential risks caused by their systemic interactions. We investigate a simple dynamical model for understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target and an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with clustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable region, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium (ii) a locally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior and (iii) a globally unstable region. A crude calibration of parameters to data puts the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price bubble, resembling a ""Great Moderation"", followed by a crash, with a period of approximately 10-15 years, which we dub the ""Basel leverage cycle"". We propose a criterion for rating macroprudential policies based on their ability to minimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family of leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of Basel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to countercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases. We find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average leverage used by the bank the relative size of the bank and the fundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal when the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low in the opposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy is closer to constant leverage. We also find that systemic risk can be dramatically decreased by lowering the leverage target adjustment speed of the banks.",2015,2015-07-15,0,Arxiv: Economics,,Systemic risk; Econometrics; Economics; Economic bubble; Leverage cycle; Risk Control; Basel II; Great Moderation; Leverage (finance); Volatility (finance),https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04136.pdf,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04136.pdf http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04136 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150704136A/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04136 https://scirate.com/arxiv/1507.04136,lens,004-675-123-759-385

"Thimann, C.","The economics of insurance, its borders with finance and implications for systemic regulation","Global financial regulators are currently reflecting on the nature of the insurance business. Specifically, they are trying to classify insurance into traditional’ and non-traditional’ activities, and to distinguish them from non-insurance’ activities. Subsequently, they will seek to apply different regulatory treatments to these categories to achieve better control of systemic risk in the global financial system. This means that one of the most important current questions in international finance is what is insurance and where does insurance endThis paper aims to elaborate on the economics of insurance and its borders with general finance. It argues that the classification challenge by regulators partly stems from terminological confusion between insurance activities and more general financial activities. Insurance and finance both use the same terms in particular the ubiquitous notion of risk but attach fundamentally different meanings to them. With the proper terminology at hand and a clear distinction between insurance products, product management activities and balance sheet management activities, the limits of insurance can be re-established. Such delineation is essential to determine appropriate systemic risk regulation.",2015,2015-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Control (management); Global financial system; Confusion; International finance; Product management; Terminology,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_5207.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_5207.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ces:ceswps:_5207,lens,005-633-436-801-880
"McNamara, C.M.; Metrick, A.",The lehman brothers bankruptcy f: introduction to the ISDA master agreement,"When Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (LBHI) sought Chapter 11 protection, the more than 6,000 counterparties with which its subsidiaries had entered into over 900,000 over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions faced the question of how best to respond to protect their interests. The existence of standardized documentation developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for entering into such transactions meant that the counterparties likely thought that they were dealing with a well defined and robust set of options in answering this question. Yet, in practice, the resolution of Lehman’s OTC derivatives portfolio ended up being less orderly than the existence of standardized documentation might have suggested it would be. This case explores: (1) whether the default provisions contained in the Master Agreement played any meaningful role in Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and its outcome, (2) whether changes should be made to the Master Agreement to reduce the systemic risk associated with derivatives transactions, and (3) how attempts to create global certainty through the use of standardized agreements can be thwarted by the operation of local laws.",2015,2015-03-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Accounting; Subsidiary; Business; Systemic risk; ISDA Master Agreement; Portfolio; Bankruptcy; Financial regulation; Documentation; Certainty,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ysm:ypfswp:59185,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ysm:ypfswp:59185,lens,007-604-912-029-183

Through a dataset that covers 2678 European banks spanning the period 1996 2011 and the methodology of panel regression, the empirical findings document that investment banks have a negative effect on systemic risk in the banking sector. To show the heterogeneity of systemic risk determinants, the study sample was divided according to the economic development of a country into two groups: advanced and developing countries. We examine the implications of banks’ activity and risk-taking that manifest themselves as spreading and growing instability in the banking system.

"Cho, D.H.; Choi, K.",Time-varying co-movements and contagion effects in asian sovereign CDS markets,"(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)I. Credit default swap (CDS) has been one of the fastest growing derivatives in global financial markets for the last decade. A sovereign CDS provides insuranc by securing principal of the bond. For that reason, the sovereign CDS spread1 proxies the risk of the country's financial market as well as its economic situation. From the protection seller's perspective, the CDS spread represents the expected loss from the swap contract. Therefore, a rise in the spread of sovereign CDS indicates a higher probability of expected loss or credit events the CDS spread can be a useful indicator of a country's credit risk. A number of earlier studies have focused on this aspect. For instance, Hull, Predescu and White (2004) report that changes in the CDS spread are useful in forecasting credit downgrade. Furthermore, it has been argued that CDS markets hold a dominant position over bond markets when it comes to price discovery function: See Blanco et al. (2005), Zhu (2006) and Ammer and Cai (2007).In contrast, the negative aspects of sovereign CDS have been criticized because speculative transactions may generate sudden upward swings in the CDS spread of a particular country. In addition, it has been noted that naked CDS investors-who purchase CDSs only for speculative purposes without possessing the bond-may manipulate the market and cause excessive price increases. The EU has regarded them as one of the factors that provoked the European financial crisis and eventually, at the end of 2012, enforced a regulation to prohibit sovereign CDS trading by naked CDS investors.Considering the economic fundamentals in some emerging economies in East and Southeast Asia, the sovereign CDS spreads in the region fluctuated significantly on the day following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy: Korea (14.1bp), Philippines (14.7bp), Indonesia (15.2bp) and Malaysia (13.7bp) and on the day following the US credit downgrade: Korea (20.95bp), Philippines (29.99bp), Indonesia (27.09bp) and Malaysia (17.68bp). Dynamic and fast growing Asian emerging economies are susceptible to global variables with a larger volatility. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility of contagion effects with which a sharp rise in the CDS spread in one nation may be transmitted to other countries, generating higher sovereign default risk in the entire region.Previous literature on the CDS spread mainly analyzes the determinants of the CDS spread. For instance, Duffie (1999), Elton et al. (2001), Huang and Huang (2003) and Longstaffet al. (2005) analyze the relationship between the CDS spread and bonds. Alexander and Kaeck (2008) and Zang et al. (2009) find that the stock market risk is a determinant of the changes in the CDS spread.2 In terms of systemic risk, Lown and Morgan (2006) analyze the impact of credit cycles on the business cycles. However, Gorton and He (2008) argue that credit cycles have their own dynamics separate from business cycles. Despite the plethora of studies on the determinants of the CDS spread-and as a part of such attempts, investigation on the relationship between the CDS spread and other financial markets such as the stock market or foreign exchange market-research on the interconnectedness among sovereign CDS spreads from different countries is rare. The only exception is the work by Gunduz and Kaya (2013), which discovers the co-movement of CDS spreads in ten Eurozone countries by using the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model suggested by Engle (2002).The purpose of this paper is to investigate this rarely recognized phenomenonthe interconnectedness of sovereign CDS spreads and the contagion of default risk. To do that, we analyze the co-movements and spillovers in seven Asian sovereign CDS markets after the 2007 global financial crisis. We employ the corrected Dynamic Conditional Correlation (cDCC) model by Aielli (2013), an improved version the DCC model, and identify the correlation among the CDS spreads in our sample countries.",2015,2015-12-31,4,East Asian Economic Review,,Economics; Credit risk; Financial market; Bond market; Financial crisis; Sovereign default; Stock market; Credit default swap; Monetary economics; Bond,http://dx.doi.org/10.11644/kiep.jeai.2015.19.4.301,https://www.eaerweb.org/selectArticleInfo.do?article_a_no=JE0001_2015_v19n4_357&ano=JE0001_2015_v19n4_357 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3922183871/time-varying-co-movements-and-contagion-effects-in https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002070209 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ris:eaerev:0020 https://ideas.repec.org/a/ris/eaerev/0020.html http://dspace.kci.go.kr/handle/kci/1707684,lens,006-654-467-708-32X
"Donald, M.S.; Bateman, H.; Buckley, R.P.; Liu, K.; Nicholls, R.",Too connected to fail: the regulation of systemic risk within australia's superannuation system,"The funds, entities, and regulators involved in the Australian superannuation industry together comprise a system that is complex and dynamic. The differentiation between roles and the distribution of responsibility amongst entities provides the system with a measure of resilience against the local failure of any one of the entities. However, the interconnections that bind and constitute the system also have the potential to transmit risks within the system, creating the potential for the impact of local failures to amplify through propagation, or in other ways to pose risks to the system as a whole. This article uses a new data set on 200 of Australia’s largest superannuation funds to map and assess those links and to identify the challenges those links pose to the scheme of prudential regulation applied to the superannuation system in Australia. It finds that the function of the entity and the legal form of the linkages, both of which are more variegated than typically occurs in banking sector transactions, crucially influences whether, and to what extent, various types of failures might be transmitted across the system. It also finds that we may be materially under-estimating the possibility that local failures in the superannuation system, which are a near certainty given the current regulatory risk appetite, will have a systemic impact. The findings have broad application across pension and institutional investment markets worldwide.",2015,2015-12-11,0,Journal of Financial Regulation,,Public economics; Engineering; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Institutional investor; Prudential regulation; Resilience (network); Pension; Distribution (economics); Certainty; Function (engineering),http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jfr/fjv010,http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/fapi/datastream/unsworks:37138/bin9b363466-e7e9-474b-b1ba-1ac489288a88?view=true https://academic.oup.com/jfr/article-abstract/2/1/56/2357872 http://academic.oup.com/jfr/article-abstract/2/1/56/2357872 https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/refreg/v2y2016i1p56-78..html,lens,003-472-540-468-283

"Hosszú, Z.; Körmendi, G.; Mérõ, B.",Univariate and multivariate filters to measure the credit gap,"Within the framework of the Basel III capital regulation, macroprudential authorities may order the accumulation of countercyclical capital buffers in the period when systemic risks are building up. According to recommendations, it is worth setting the size of the capital buffer on the basis of the magnitude of the credit-to-GDP ratio gap. Therefore, the time series of Hungary’s credit-to-GDP ratio is decomposed to trend and cyclical components (credit gap) using four trend filtering methods: univariate Hodrick Prescott filter, univariate Christiano Fitzgerald filter, univariate Beveridge Nelson filter and multivariate Hodrick Prescott filter. The decomposition was carried out separately for the household and corporate segments. Of the four methods, it is the of the multivariate Hodrick Prescott filter, which also uses the information content of other variables, that reflect experts’ assessment relating to developments in lending in Hungary the most. In addition, endpoint uncertainty was also the smallest in this case, i.e. the receipt of new data caused the smallest changes in the values estimated for previous periods here.",2015,2015-01-01,0,,,Filter (signal processing); Systemic risk; Econometrics; Multivariate statistics; Order (exchange); Univariate; Receipt; Basel III; Mathematics; Capital (economics),https://ideas.repec.org/p/mnb/opaper/2015-118.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/mnb/opaper/2015-118.html,lens,009-159-756-616-49X

Nevertheless, the shadow banking system a culprit of the crisis also exists in China and recently has taken a turn for the worse.

This article examines the systemic risks created by the proliferation of wealth management products and sheds light on the underlying logic of the policy responses adopted by Chinese regulatory authorities.

"Olgiati, S.; Danovi, A.",ZETATM methodology and variation in the systemic risk of default: accounting for the effects of type II (false negative) errors variation on lending,"This paper argues that a standard Bayesian transformation of the ZETA bankruptcy prediction meth-odology, introduced by Altman in 1968-1977, allows for an a posteriori update of conditional Typeand II errors due to variation in the systemic likelihood of default. The Bayesian transformation can be used both to condition a loan manager’s prior decision (generally based on Basel II-compliant Internal Rating Based system or Credit Agency’s Rating) and to update such a decision on the basis of any posterior hypothesis (based on actuarial frequentist assumptions of conditional hazard rates) regarding the creditworthiness and the probability of default of an underlying pool of securities. At the same time under a Bayesian frameworkthe ZETA diagnostic test can be conditioned on the new evidence introduced by other tests to increase the total sensitivity of the default prediction models (IRB ratings, TTC ratings, logit, probit, neural) to update the commercial bank’s lending decisions. A ground-state, static meta-analysis of Altman’s et al. ZETA original article (1977) reveals that the odds of the commercial bank detecting a default after the ZETA score has been introduced (post-test) is 13.2 times more effective than the a priori prediction. Under the same assumptions, the odds of the commercial bank detecting a survival after (post-test) the ZETA score has been introduced is 12.2 times more effective than the a priori.",2015,2015-01-01,0,,,Bayesian probability; Logit; Odds; Econometrics; Economics; Frequentist inference; Probit; Bankruptcy prediction; Probability of default; Predictive modelling,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/36617?mode=full.2777,https://aisberg.unibg.it/handle/10446/36617?mode=full.2777,lens,009-228-098-284-556

To this end, this work offers, in addition to these discussions, a number of policy recommendations to be used directly into the climate negotiations, as in the format and language of international treaties.This is the historical and timing of insertion of Health concerns in discussions on Climate Change, as they determine the success of the agreement and cooperation between countries.",2014,2014-01-01,0,,,Climate change; Systemic risk; Position (finance); Negotiation; Geography; Convention; Public administration; International relations; Global health; Cartography; Promotion (rank),https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/37175,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/37175 https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/bitstream/icict/37175/2/ve_Rodolfo_Milhomem_ENSP_2014,lens,008-251-488-033-815

The equity risk module contains a symmetric adjustment mechanism called equity dampener which shall reduce procyclicality of capital requirements and thus systemic risk in the insurance sector. We critically review the equity risk module in three steps: we first analyze the sensitivities of the equity risk module with respect to the underlying technical basis, then work out potential basis risk (i.e., deviations of the insurers actual equity risk from the Solvency II equity risk), and-based on these -measure the impact of the symmetric adjustment mechanism on the goals of Solvency II. The equity risk module is backward looking in nature and a substantial basis risk exists if realistic equity portfolios of insurers are considered. Both underline the importance of the own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA) under Solvency II. Moreover, we show that the equity dampener leads to substantial deviations from the proposed 99.5% confidence level and thereby reduce procyclicality of capital requirements.

Attempts to overcome the effects of informational distortions by delegating macroprudential policy to a supranational body are also likely to entail welfare losses. We study the tradeoff between macroprudential policy autonomy and centralization by means of a signaling game of imperfect information played by two national regulators. The model concentrates on informational frictions in an environment with otherwise fully aligned preferences. We show that even in the absence of evident conflicting goals, the non-transferable nature of some regulatory information creates misreporting incentives.

"Goodwin, B.K.; Hungerford, A.",Copula-Based models of systemic risk ins agriculture: implications for crop insurance and reinsurance contracts,"The federal crop insurance program has been a major fixture of U.S. agricultural policy since the 1930s, and continues to grow in size and importance. Indeed, it now represents the most prominent farm policy instrument, accounting for more government spending than any other farm commodity program. The 2014 Farm Bill further expanded the crop insurance program and introduced a number of new county level revenue insurance plans. In 2013, over $123 billion in crop value was insured under the program. Crop revenue insurance, first introduced in the 1990s, now accounts for nearly 70% of the total liability in the program. The available plans cover losses that result from a revenue shortfall that can be triggered by multiple, dependent sources of risk either low prices, low yields, or a combination of both. The actuarial practices currently applied when rating these plans essentially involve the application of a Gaussian copula model to the pricing of dependent risks. We evaluate the suitability of this assumption by considering a number of alternative copula models. In particular, we use combinations of pair wise copulas of conditional distributions to model multiple sources of risk. We find that this approach is generally preferred by model fitting criteria in the applications considered here. We demonstrate that alternative approaches to modeling dependencies in a portfolio of risks may have significant implications for premium rates in crop insurance.",2014,2014-10-16,80,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,,General insurance; Actuarial science; Economics; Reinsurance; Revenue; Crop insurance; Portfolio; Key person insurance; Auto insurance risk selection; Risk pool,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aau086,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:oup:ajagec:v:97:y:2015:i:3:p:879-896. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3574242 http://academic.oup.com/ajae/article-abstract/97/3/879/66784 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1093/ajae/aau086 https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/ajagec/v97y2015i3p879-896..html https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6812155 https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article-abstract/97/3/879/66784,lens,008-631-652-931-989

Frequently, these actors are human agents, such as rogue traders or aggressive financial innovators, terrorists, groups of dissidents, or unauthorized sources of sensitive or secret information about government or private sector activities. In other instances, influential actors take the form of climate change, communications technologies, or socioeconomic globalization. Although these individual forces may be small relative to state governments or international institutions, or may operate on long time scales, the changes they catalyze can pose significant challenges to the analysis and practice of international relations through the operation of complex feedbacks and interactions of individual agents and interconnected systems. We call these challenges femtorisks, and emphasize their importance for two reasons. First, in isolation, they may be inconsequential and semiautonomous but when embedded in complex adaptive systems, characterized by individual agents able to change, learn from experience, and pursue their own agendas, the strategic interaction between actors can propel systems down paths of increasing, even global, instability. Second, because their influence stems from complex interactions at interfaces of multiple systems (e.g., social, financial, political, technological, ecological, etc.), femtorisks challenge standard approaches to risk assessment, as higher-order consequences cascade across the boundaries of socially constructed complex systems.

"Cichorska, J.",Deleveraging in the banking sector,"During the economic conjuncture banks conduct expansionary credit policy. Liberal requirements for borrowers in both the credit rating, as well as conditions for loans led to an excessive increase in debt. The high increase in loans was the cause of increase in credit risk. The sign of it was a deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio and increasing the share of problematic loans, or unpaid on time.Credit growth has coincided with a fall in the value of bank deposits, which exacerbated the negative liquidity gap. The situation was exacerbated insecurity in equity. Banks continued to hold equity at the necessary minimum prescribed by the rules of financial supervision and were using leverage more and more. In many banks, the ratio of risk to equity was inappropriate. Excessive debt of banks, the low level of equity, the volatility of deposits and negative liquidity gap as in brought a decrease of confidence for banks. Increasing systemic risk revealed that the capital requirements known as Basel II or New Capital Accord are not sufficient. One of the signs of the fight against the growing crisis was the of an improved capital adequacy ratio referred to as Basel III. New prudential standards recommend an increase in shareholders' equity, which leads to a reduction in leverage.1. The changes caused by the of Basel IIIBasel III regulations are contained in the document of the Basel Committee Basel III: A Global Regulator for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems1. Their aim is to strengthen the capital in banks. Basel III regulations introduce a modernized definition of equities in which these funds (TCTotal Capital) have been divided into two components: Tierand Tier 2. Category of Tierconstitute funds which are intended to cover losses arising from the normal course of business. Funds forming a Tierare the highest category core capital (CET1common equity Tier 1) and other core funds (AT1additional Tier 1). Category Tierconsist supplementary funds, which are intended to cover losses in the event of bank failure. The new solutions completely abandoned the previously Tiercategory on short-term capital. Classification of own funds according to regulations of Basel III is shown in Figure 1.The whole process of comprising of various detailed arrangements for the allocation of capital into categories, which should determine the level of risk and protection against cyclical nature of the economy is set for many years and will be implemented in phases by 2019. The first changes which refers to increase the capital requirements for counterparty risk related to come into force early in 20132. In the Basel Committee document Basel III introduced a number of rules for the bank's own funds. New relations of each category of equity CET1, T1 and TC3 to risk-weighted assets where identified. Banks have to reach the final required level of these ratios to the end of 20144. Minimum levels of factors CET1 and TC at various stages of implementation of Basel III are shown in Table 1.In order to increase long-term stability of the banking system there was created an additional safeguards determine the value of capital enlarged by reserves also specially created against market downturns. These reserves took the form of two ratio:- Capital Conservation Buffer,- Countercyclical Buffer.Capital buffer has been set at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. Its value is added to the factors CET1 and TC, indicating the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets.

Our analysis presents not only current levels of domestic systemic importance of individual banks but also the changes. We also consider the systemic risk of the whole banking system, by investigating how D-SIBs and non-D-SIBs are correlated before and after the recent financial crises using Copula. We find that the systemic importance of major banks is decreasing, while some banks becoming more systemically important should require tight regulations. D-SIBs as a whole subsystem display stronger correlation with non-D-SIBs than the individual D-SIBs, which alerts the regulatory to pay attention to too-many-to-fail problems. Contagion effects between D-SIBs and non-D-SIBs exist during the subprime crisis, but did not exist during the European debt crisis.

Current studies of correlations in Chinese market mainly focus on the static correlations between return series, and this calls for an urgent need to investigate their dynamic correlations. Our study aims to reveal the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chinese stock market, and offer an exact interpretation for the evolution behavior. The correlation matrices constructed from the return series of 367 A-share stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2011 are calculated over a moving window with a size of 400 days. The evolutions of the statistical properties of the correlation coefficients, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the correlation matrices are carefully analyzed. We find that the stock correlations are significantly increased in the periods of two market crashes in 2001 and 2008, during which only five eigenvalues significantly deviate from the random correlation matrix, and the systemic risk is higher in these volatile periods than calm periods. By investigating the significant contributors of the deviating eigenvectors in different time periods, we observe a dynamic evolution behavior in business sectors such as IT, electronics, and real estate, which lead the rise (drop) before (after) the crashes.

"Kobayashi, T.; Hasui, K.",Efficient immunization strategies to prevent financial contagion,"Many immunization strategies have been proposed to prevent infectious viruses from spreading through a network. In this work, we study efficient immunization strategies to prevent a default contagion that might occur in a financial network. An essential difference from the previous studies on immunization strategy is that we take into account the possibility of serious side effects. Uniform immunization refers to a situation in which banks are vaccinated with a common low-risk asset. The riskiness of immunized banks will decrease significantly, but the level of systemic risk may increase due to the de-diversification effect. To overcome this side effect, we propose another immunization strategy, called counteractive immunization, which prevents pairs of banks from failing simultaneously.

"Allen, F.; Goldstein, I.; Jagtiani, J.; Lang, W.W.",Enhancing prudential standards in financial regulations,"The financial crisis has generated fundamental reforms in the financial regulatory system in the U.S. and internationally. Much of this reform was in direct response to the weaknesses revealed in the precrisis system. The new macroprudential approach to financial regulations focuses on risks arising in financial markets broadly, as well as the potential impact on the financial system that may arise from financial distress at systemically important financial institutions. Systemic risk is the key factor in financial stability, but our current understanding of systemic risk is rather limited. While the goal of using regulation to maintain financial stability is clear, it is not obvious how to design an effective regulatory framework that achieves the financial stability while also promoting financial innovations. This paper discusses academic research and expert opinions on this vital subject of financial stability and regulatory reforms. Specifically, among other issues, it discusses the impact of increasing public disclosure of supervisory information, the effectiveness of bank stress testing as a tool to enhance financial stability, whether the financial crisis was caused by too big to fail (TBTF), and whether the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA) resolution regime would be effective in achieving financial stability and ending TBTF.",2014,2014-12-03,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Public disclosure; Consumer Protection Act; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Direct response; Financial stability,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedpwp/14-36.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedpwp/14-36.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:fip:fedpwp:14-36,lens,007-876-338-227-976

"Ko, D.W.",Financial regulatory reforms in korea responding to the 2008 global financial crisis: are they following the global trends,"I. In the wake of the global financial crisis ('GFC') in late 2008, many countries around the world have reformed their financial regulatory systems, including banking and financial regulation, by responding to the crisis in line with the new global regulatory framework initiated by The Group of Twenty ('G-20') and international financial organisations, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('BCBS') and the Financial Stability Board ('FSB'). Notably, for instance, the United States of America, where the subprime mortgage crisis triggered the GFC, enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ('Dodd-Frank')1 as a response to the GFC. The DoddFrank initiated a major new regulatory framework, addressing macro-prudential regulation issues of financial stability and systemic risks as well as promulgating detailed rules on issues such as mortgage lending and underwriting. In the process, the US reforms have substantially affected the regulatory responses of other countries.Similarly, the Korean government also introduced reforms to the financial regulatory framework by proposing new legislation and amendments, responding to the GFC. The GFC affected the Korean economy and financial system by causing capital and liquidity shortage problems in financial institutions, especially commercial banks. Those commercial banks with weak capital were supported by the Bank Recapitalization Fund launched in March 2009 with funding mostly provided by the central bank.2 Further, the Corporate Restructuring Fund was launched in May 2009, in order to purchase distressed bonds and assets of those companies in danger of insolvency and firms under corporate structural improvement.3 With respect to capital inflow in the foreign exchange market, the GFC revealed Korea's high vulnerability to changes in the world economy and sharp capital movements. Moreover, a large number of financial consumers such as depositors or individual investors, incurred huge monetary losses or damage from their deposits with insolvent mutual saving banks or their investments in financial investment products due to their bad portfolio performances amid the GFC.Consequently, regulatory reforms have been proposed to rectify these emerging problems. The focus has been on reinforcing financial consumer protection, improving corporate governance of financial institutions, implementing 'Basel III' (the recently strengthened capital adequacy rules of banks after the GFC), introducing a bank levy system (referred to as the macroprudential stability levy system in Korea), and enhancing a financial information sharing scheme among financial regulation-related agencies. Despite these various measures, the author believes that further reforms remain necessary in order to both address the problems revealed during the GFC and to further enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the Korean financial industry.This article examines the Korean regulatory reform measures taken in response to the GFC and explores some recommendations for the future financial regulatory policy and framework. Following thePart II overviews the implementation of Basel III, and Part III examines the regulatory measures taken to reinforce financial consumer protection. Part IV investigates the measures to improve the corporate governance system of financial institutions, and Partreviews the issue of the launching of a macro-prudential stability levy system. Part VI explores the issue of a financial information sharing scheme, and Part VII discusses the issue of reshuffling the financial regulatory organisation scheme, which is the most imminent and controversial issue with respect to regulatory reforms. Finally, Part VIII explains other issues for financial regulatory reforms, including the establishment of a macro-prudential supervision and policy framework and the creation of a new framework for regulating systemically important domestic financial institutions.",2014,2014-01-01,1,Asia Pacific Law Review,,Finance; Financial analysis; Systemic risk; Subprime mortgage crisis; Economics; Regulatory reform; Financial crisis; Basel III; Corporate governance; Financial regulation; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10192557.2014.11745923,https://scholarworks.bwise.kr/skku/handle/2021.sw.skku/57600,lens,002-201-073-404-377

"Mijatovic, M.M.",Financial stability in an open market economy: A holistic approach to economic policy,"Financial stability does not have a precise definition. A stable financial system implies a state of institutional, regulation and an open market environment in which accurate information is available and there are effective mechanisms to adequately assess the risk in transactions. In such a business environment, the return corresponds to the undertaken risk and the risks are properly identified and addressed. Systemic risk includes all risks in the market, acting alone or in interaction with the associated risks that can jeopardize the stability of the system. Macroprudential policy is a policy that is focused on threats that create such systemic risk. An appropriate choice of macroeconomic and prudential policies is oriented towards the creation of a financial system that is able to absorb serious disorders, prevent accumulation of systemic risk and perform the basic functions in a safe and sound financial market. In open economies, especially those with the choice of a more fixed exchange rate policy framework such as euroisation, monetary policy instruments become less effective and limited. In such a policy situation, the maintenance of financial stability becomes more important and targets not only monetary policy but also the overall macroeconomic policy stance. The institutional and legal framework aims to create a financial infrastructure that would initiate preventive actions to preserve stability and prevent the development of a crisis which is the final phase of instability.",2014,2014-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Economic policy; Monetary policy; Economy; Business; Systemic risk; Open market operation; Financial market; Exchange rate; Open economy; Financial risk management; Financial system; Financial risk,http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:srs:cfchap:v2-14,http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:srs:cfchap:v2-14,lens,003-180-147-028-412
"Battersby, P.","Good corp, bad corp: market crimes and systemic risk","Collective responsibility for criminal acts is easier to apportion when the collectivity concerned is a private corporation subject to state and international law. For example, BP and Transocean, the lessee and the owner respectively, of the oil rig Deepwater Horizon accepted criminal liability for the pollution in the Gulf of Mexico following the spillage of some 4.9 million barrels of oil from BP’s deep-ocean Macondo well in 2010. Criminal charges, to which BP pleaded guilty, covered not only environmental damage but also fraudulent behaviour by BP executives in misleading US Congress as to the severity of the disaster (Ramseur and Hagerty, 2013, pp.6). The National Commission appointed to investigate cited a collective failure attributable to a corporate culture of risk taking and safety cost aversion, with primary responsibility falling to BP as a corporate entity and not merely to individual employees, even if some liabilities were subsequently defrayed to subcontractors (Chief Counsel’s Report, 2011, pp. 248 249 Oil Spill Commission, 2011, pp. 2, 90 93, 95). Whereas responsibility for international or state crimes is apportioned to individuals, whether they are acting under orders or not, national-level corporate criminal laws increasingly acknowledge collective guilt. Under US law, as in all jurisdictions that accept corporate criminal liability, corporations are liable for the criminal actions of individual employees where such acts are committed within the framework of their contractual obligations to their employer (Pieth and Ivory, 2011, p. 7).",2014,2014-01-01,0,the Unlawful Society,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Law; Commission; State (polity); Money laundering; Collective responsibility; International law; Organizational culture; West Texas Intermediate,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137282965_5,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137282965_5 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137282965_5,lens,010-116-107-946-793

"Lacoue-Labarthe, D.",In search of the banking regulator amids financial reforms of the 1930s,"Some bank reforms of the 1930s in the United States may have been overvalued. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 actually created new endogenous risks involving potential systemic effects. Deposit insurance failed to address the main cause of banking panics, and rather strengthened inefficient unit banks, while the prohibition of interstate bank branching continued to hinder banks to diversify idiosyncratic risks. The separation of commercial and investment banking put an end to certain conflicts of interest but it created an opportunity cost by preventing universal banking from developing effectively. Finally, an untimely intervention in a duopolistic conflict made the regulator a captive figure. By contrast, major innovations covering bailout processes and prudential regulation appear to have been underestimated. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation of 1932 established the foundations of an investor of last resort, giving the Treasury the authority to recapitalize insolvent financial institutions deemed too big to fail. The newly established banking regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of 1933, was given a special bank-closure rule, separate from the usual bankruptcy proceedings, which opened a way towards orderly resolution of failing banks in order to protect the economy from the spread of systemic risk.",2014,2014-01-15,2,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Investment banking; Retail banking; Deposit insurance; Bailout; Too big to fail; Bankruptcy; Bank run,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00937533,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00937533 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/93/75/33/PDF/CR14-EFI01.pdf https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00937533 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:laf:wpaper:cr1401 https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/wpaper/hal-00937533.html,lens,005-214-869-751-35X
"Feng, X.; Hayes, D.J.",Is government involvement really necessary: implications for systemic risk and crop reinsurance contracts,"Agriculture is subject to substantial systemic risk of crop yield losses due to widespread natural disasters. The systemic risk has been a major obstacle for the development of private crop insurance markets. Driven by spatially correlated weather events, crop losses are highly correlated within a certain area. As a result, the portfolio insurance risk associated with the crop losses has been raised far above what it would be if individual losses were independent, as proposed by Miranda and Glauber (1997). For example, Miranda and Glauber (1997) find that the portfolio risk faced by U.S. crop insurers is about ten times larger than that of conventional insurance lines. Large portfolio risk requires high premium rates to cover the cost of bearing the systemic portfolio risk unless the cost is subsidized. Some national governments, such as the U.S., are willing to provide subsidies and reinsurance for crop insurance policies so that they are affordable to farmers. In this way, the cost of bearing the systemic risk has been transferred to governments. For those countries where there are no government subsidies, private crop insurers would have to charge high premiums, in order to hold large enough reserves for the potential systemic loss or purchase expensive international reinsurance. In this way, the cost of bearing the systemic risk is actually passed onto farmers eventually. Consequently, farmers are either buying extremely expensive insurance to get insured, or being exposed to huge crop loss risks.",2014,2014-01-01,0,,,Finance; Agriculture; Portfolio insurance; Business; Systemic risk; Reinsurance; Agribusiness; Order (exchange); Crop insurance; Subsidy,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/aaeacj/184241.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/aaeacj/184241.html,lens,006-642-395-440-628

"Peydró, J.",Macroprudential policy and credit supply cycles,"Western Europe and the United States have recently experienced a major banking crisis, followed by a severe economic recession with significant costs in terms of aggregate output and employment. These phenomena are not unique: banking crises are recurrent phenomena, triggering deep and long-lasting recessions. The main channel by which weaknesses in banks’ balance sheets affect the real economy is via a reduction in the supply of credit, i.e. a credit crunch. Importantly, banking crises are not random events that stem from exogenous risks, but arise after periods of very strong private credit growth. Therefore, for systemic risk, it is crucial to understand the determinants and implications of credit in good and bad times the so-called credit cycles. This paper analyses the relationship between credit cycles and systemic risk and, in particular, whether macroprudential policies affect credit supply cycles (i.e. credit cycles stemming from credit supply rather than demand). Moreover, the author reviews the impact on credit supply from one macroprudential policy: countercyclical bank capital requirements (based on the Spanish dynamic provisioning).",2014,2014-01-01,0,Financial Stability Review,,Systemic risk; Economics; Credit risk; Credit crunch; Balance sheet; Recession; Credit enhancement; Monetary economics; Credit history; Credit valuation adjustment,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bfr/fisrev/20141821.html,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bfr/fisrev/20141821.html https://www.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/publications/FSR18_Peydro.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bfr:fisrev:2014:18:21,lens,010-041-574-677-701

"Joseph, A.; Vodenska, I.; Stanley, E.; Chen, G.","Netconomics: novel forecasting techniques from the combination of big data, network science and economics","The combination of the network theoretic approach with recently available abundant economic data leads to the development of novel analytic and computational tools for modelling and forecasting key economic indicators. The main idea is to introduce a topological component into the analysis, taking into account consistently all higher-order interactions. We present three basic methodologies to demonstrate different approaches to harness the resulting network gain. First, a multiple linear regression optimisation algorithm is used to generate a relational network between individual components of national balance of payment accounts. This model describes annual statistics with a high accuracy and delivers good forecasts for the majority of indicators. Second, an early-warning mechanism for global financial crises is presented, which combines network measures with standard economic indicators. From the analysis of the cross-border portfolio investment network of long-term debt securities, the proliferation of a wide range of over-the-counter-traded financial derivative products, such as credit default swaps, can be described in terms of gross-market values and notional outstanding amounts, which are associated with increased levels of market interdependence and systemic risk.

Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets. We propose a novel measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic risk indicator. We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the interplay between financial markets and financially related news. We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the financial markets. Cohesiveness is more general and robust measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms.

"Mainik, G.; Schaanning, E.",On dependence consistency of covar and some other systemic risk measures,"This paper is dedicated to the consistency of systemic risk measures with respect to stochastic dependence. It compares two alternative notions of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) available in the current literature. These notions are both based on the conditional distribution of a random variablegiven a stress event for a random variable X, but they use different types of stress events. We derive representations of these alternative CoVaR notions in terms of copulas, study their general dependence consistency and compare their performance in several stochastic models. Our central finding is that conditioning onVaRα(X) gives a much better response to dependence betweenandthan conditioning onVaRα(X). We prove general that relate the dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning onVaRα(X) to well established on concordance ordering of multivariate distributions or their copulas. These also apply to some other systemic risk measures, such as the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and the Systemic Impact Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR based on the stress eventVaRα(X) is not dependence consistent. In particular, if (X, Y) is bivariate normal, then CoVaR based onVaRα(X) is not an increasing function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues arise in the bivariatemodel and in the model withmargins and a Gumbel copula. In all these cases, CoVaR based onVaRα(X) is an increasing function of the dependence parameter.",2014,2014-03-28,114,Statistics & Risk Modeling,,Statistics; Random variable; Stochastic modelling; Gumbel distribution; Econometrics; Copula (linguistics); Multivariate normal distribution; Mathematics; Conditional probability distribution; Expected shortfall; Bivariate analysis,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/strm-2013-1164,https://www.systemic-risk-hub.org/papers/bibliography/MainikSchaanning_2012_Preview.pdf http://www.bertrand-maillet.net/bibliography/MainikSchaanning_2012_Preview.pdf https://www.bertrand-maillet.net/bibliography/MainikSchaanning_2012_Preview.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/strimo/v31y2014i1p29n4.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bpj:strimo:v:31:y:2014:i:1:p:29:n:4 https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/423046 http://www.systemic-risk-hub.org/papers/bibliography/MainikSchaanning_2012_Preview.pdf https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/strm.2014.31.issue-1/strm-2013-1164/strm-2013-1164.xml?lang=en,lens,010-343-664-389-328
"Li, Z.; Lin, X.; Peleato-Inarrea, B.; Pollak, I.",Optimal monitoring and mitigation of systemic risk in financial networks,"This paper studies the problem of optimally allocating a cash injection into a financial system in distress. Given a one-period borrower-lender network in which all debts are due at the same time and have the same seniority, we address the problem of allocating a fixed amount of cash among the nodes to minimize the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities. Assuming all the loan amounts and asset values are fixed and that there are no bankruptcy costs, we show that this problem is equivalent to a linear program. We develop a duality-based distributed algorithm to solve it which is useful for applications where it is desirable to avoid centralized data gathering and computation. Since some applications require forecasting and planning for a wide variety of different contingencies, we also consider the problem of minimizing the expectation of the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities under the assumption that the net external asset holdings of all institutions are stochastic. We show that this problem is a two-stage stochastic linear program. To solve it, we develop two algorithms based on Monte Carlo sampling: Benders decomposition algorithm and projected stochastic gradient descent. We show that if the defaulting nodes never pay anything, the deterministic optimal cash injection allocation problem is an NP-hard mixed-integer linear program. However, modern optimization software enables the computation of very accurate solutions to this problem on a personal computer in a few seconds for network sizes comparable with the size of the US banking system. In addition, we address the problem of allocating the cash injection amount so as to minimize the number of nodes in default. For this problem, we develop two heuristic algorithms: a reweighed l1 minimization algorithm and a greedy algorithm. We illustrate these two algorithms using three synthetic network structures for which the optimal solution can be calculated exactly. We also compare these two algorithms on three types random networks which are more complex.",2014,2014-01-01,1,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Statistics; Mathematical optimization; Distributed algorithm; Economics; Heuristic (computer science); Asset (economics); Stochastic gradient descent; Financial networks; Personal computer; Linear programming; Greedy algorithm,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2506326,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2506326 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2570 https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=17373&context=dissertations https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2570 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2506326 https://core.ac.uk/display/104113650 https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/open_access_dissertations/670/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1410.2570L/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1410.html#LiLPP14 https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ipollak/TSIPN_submission_20141220.pdf https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1804&context=open_access_dissertations http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2570,lens,001-650-886-927-893

Systemic risk from correlations between individual default probabilities that cannot be considered independent. Based on the structural framework by Merton (1974), we discuss a model in which these correlations arise from overlaps in banks’ portfolios.

We calculate an optimal level of diversification that has to be reached for a given level of excessive leverage to still mitigate an increase in systemic risk. In our model, this optimal diversification further depends on the market size and the market conditions (e.g. volatility). It allows to distinguish between a safe regime, in which excessive leverage does not result in an increase of systemic risk, and a risky regime, in which excessive leverage cannot be mitigated leading to an increased systemic risk.

"Schwarcz, S.L.",Regulating financial change: A functional approach,"How should we think about regulating our dynamically changing financial system Existing regulatory approaches have two temporal flaws. The obvious flaw, driven by politics and human nature (and addressed in other writings), is that financial regulation is overly reactive to past crises. This article addresses a less obvious but arguably more fundamental flaw: that financial regulation is normally tethered to the financial architecture, including the distinctive design and structure of financial firms and markets, in place when the regulation is promulgated. In order to effectively address future crises, this article argues, financial regulation must transcend that time-bound architecture. This could be done by regulating the underlying economic functions of the financial system the provision, allocation, and deployment of financial capital as well as the financial system’s capacity to serve as a network within which those functions can be conducted. The article analyzes how to design and implement such a functional approach to financial regulation. Although this approach is primarily normative, it provides regulatory ordering principles that should have practical utility not only as a set of standards to inform actual regulatory design but also as a counterweight to the prevailing view that macroprudential regulation of systemic risk can be adequately served by an ad hoc assortment of regulatory tools.",2014,2014-01-01,2,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Indirect finance; Macroprudential regulation; Industrial organization; Financial management; Financial regulation; Financial intermediary; Accounting management; Financial risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2469467,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2469467 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2469467,lens,008-175-980-724-800
"Ferrarini, G.; Saguato, P.",Regulating financial market infrastructures,"This paper focuses on the impact of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and of their regulation on the post-crisis transformation of securities and derivatives markets. It examines, in particular, the role that trading and post-trading FMIs, and their new regulatory regime, are playing in the expansion of public’ securities and derivatives markets, and the progressive shrinkage of private’ markets (which broadly coincide with the unregulated’ or less regulated’ over-the-counter (OTC) markets). The paper provides an overview of the policy approaches underlying the international crisis-era reforms to FMIs, and focuses on the dichotomy between the systemic risk’ and transaction costs’ approaches to financial markets and FMIs regulation. By reviewing the current move from private’ markets to public’ markets internationally, and with respect to the EU and US regimes, we analyze the role of trading infrastructures as liquidity providers, both in the securities markets and in the derivatives markets. And, shifting the focus to post-trading infrastructures central clearing houses (CCPs), central securities depositories (CSDs), and trade repositories (TRs) we address their role in supporting financial stability and market transparency. We conclude by identifying how regulators are now more deeply involved in FMIs’ governance and operation. We argue that such policy approach resulted in regulatory initiatives which move in the direction of increasing the systemic scope of FMIs, introducing elements of publicity in private markets, and calling for higher public supervision.This paper is a draft chapter for a forthcoming volume, ""The Oxford Handbook on Financial Regulation,"" edited by Eilis Ferran, Niamh Moloney, and Jennifer Payne, (Oxford University Press).",2014,2014-01-01,0,Lse Research Online Documents on Economics,,Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Financial market; Transparency (market); Corporate governance; Financial regulation; Financial system; Derivatives market; Transaction cost,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ehl/lserod/59683.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/ehl/lserod/59683.html,lens,000-988-791-418-086

Little data are available on risk factors influencing the time of treatment until an osteonecrosis occurs. FromDec 2004 until 21 Sep 2012, the German Register collected all patients with validated diagnoses of ONJ (N 1,229) that were reported to the national pharmaco-vigilance system or to the Register directly. We analysed 963 patients with cancerous disease and an ONJ during i.v. BP treatment. Duration of BP treatment until first diagnosis of ONJ and Kaplan Meier curves of ONJ-free survival were analysed stratified by gender, type of BP and type of cancer. Main indications for BP treatment were breast cancer (36 %), multiple myeloma (24 %), prostate cancer (16 %) and kidney cancer (4 %). Men suffered from their ONJ earlier than women. A total of 780 patients (81 %) had their ONJ during zoledronate treatment, 93 (10 %) under pamidronate and 90 (9 %) under ibandronate treatment. ONJ-free survival in single BP users was significantly longer in pamidronate-treated patients than in zoledronate or ibandronate users. Ibandronate users had the shortest median duration of treatment (17 months), similar to that of zoledronate users (21.5 months). Sequential prescription of two different BPs prolonged the period of overall BP treatment until an ONJ occurred. Time of BP treatment was shortest in patients with kidney cancer. Age or a concomitant osteoporosis did not influence the time to event of an ONJ. Systemic risk factors such as gender play a significant role in certain subgroups only.

Market capitalization, total debt, leverage, the stock market returns of an institution, and the correlation between the stock market returns of an institution and the market, are considered as simple systemic risk measures. Systemic relevance is approximated by the receipt of financial support during the financial crisis and the classification, as a systemically important institution, by national or international regulators.

The model extends the well-known static spatial lag model. All parameters can be estimated conveniently by maximum likelihood. We establish the theoretical properties of the model and show that the maximum likelihood estimator for the static parameters is consistent and asymptotically normal. We also study the information theoretic optimality of the updating steps for the time-varying spatial dependence parameter. We adopt the model to empirically investigate the spatial dependence between eight European sovereign CDS spreads over the period 2009--2014, which includes the European sovereign debt crisis. We construct our spatial weight matrix using cross-border lending data and include country-specific and Europe-wide risk factors as controls. We find a high, time-varying degree of spatial spillovers in the sovereign CDS spread data. There is a downturn in spatial dependence after the first half of 2012, which is consistent with policy measures taken by the European Central Bank.

The exact specification is motivated by standard structural models of credit however, our parametrization departs from the classic Merton (1974) model and can accommodate environments where the firm's asset volatility is stochastic, asset returns can jump, and asset shocks are nonnormal. In addition, our specification nests both a standard GARCH and the Merton model, which allows for a statistical test of how leverage interacts with equity volatility. Empirically, the Structural GARCH model outperforms a standard asymmetric GARCH model for approximately 74 percent of the financial firms we analyze. We then apply the Structural GARCH model to two empirical applications: the leverage effect and systemic risk measurement.

A distinction is made between the core activities of insurers (e.g., underwriting, reserving, claims settlement, etc.) and non-core activities (such as providing financial guarantees). Statistical analysis of insurer characteristics and their relationship with a well-known systemic risk measure, systemic expected shortfall, is provided. Consistent with other research, the core activities of property-casualty insurers are found not to be systemically risky. However, we do find evidence that some core activities of life insurers, particularly separate accounts and group annuities, may be associated with systemic risk. The non-core activities of both property-casualty and life insurers can contribute to systemic risk. However, research findings indicate that generally insurers are victims rather than propagators of systemic risk events. The study also finds that insurers may be susceptible to intra-sector crises such as reinsurance crises arising from counterparty credit risk. New and proposed state and federal regulation are reviewed in light of the potential for systemic risk for this sector.",2014,2014-01-01,2,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Reinsurance; Credit risk; Liquidity risk; Underwriting; Financial risk management; Expected shortfall; Auto insurance risk selection,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2400577,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2400577_code2099.pdf?abstractid=2400577&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2400577 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2400577 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2235140,lens,007-818-004-293-011

We summarize and classify 43 theoretical and empirical research papers from both academia and practitioner organizations. The survey reveals that traditional insurance activity in the life, non-life, and reinsurance sectors neither contributes to systemic risk, nor increases insurers' vulnerability to impairments of the financial system. However, non-traditional activities (e.g., CDS underwriting) might increase vulnerability and life insurers might be more vulnerable than non-life insurers due to higher leverage. Whether non-traditional activities also contribute to systemic risk is not entirely clear however, the activities with the potential to contribute to systemic risk include underwriting financial derivatives, providing financial guarantees, and short-term funding.

Using the banking sector as a case study, it shows the relationship between formal and informal practices during volatile international and domestic market conditions. Thauthors analyze the practice of regulation by the Bank of Russia (Bank Rossii), the central bank of the Russian Federation, of a minimum level of capital and risk management at a particular commercial bank. Thanalysis is based on regulations and consolidated statistical data from the central bank and reporting data from lending institutions. Thauthors’ principal show that, given the closed nature of the decisionmaking process, banking-sector actors set up unoffi cial interaction channels in addition to legal ones, and this intensifi es distrust in the market. Hence the capital ratio standard that is used in the reporting documents of lending institutions is not an accurate indicator of a bank’s fi nancial stability. Given the weak institutions, the tasks of cost eff ectiveness are better served by a hybrid model of accountability that is based on a balance between delegation and hands-on participation.

"Panttser, E.; Tian, W.",The bank capital: an insurance perspective,"This chapter presents an insurance framework of the bank capital by introducing a new type of capital, namely, an insurance capital. A bank pays the insurance capital to an entity which injects a pre-determined payout of capital during the period of systemic crisis. The pre-determined payout relies on the aggregative loss of a banking sector, so this contract between the bank and the entity is a capital insurance contract. In a rational expectations equilibrium setting, the entity charges an appropriate premium while the banks purchase an optimal amount of the insurance. We demonstrate that, both the entity and the banks have motivations to participate in this capital insurance program due to their increased expected utilities (welfare) respectively. The total systemic risk ex post within the capital insurance program is reduced and can be even removed eventually after repeatedly entering the capital insurance program. Therefore, this insurance capital idea should be endorsed to hedge the systemic risk and to deal with the ""too big to fail"" issues.",2014,2014-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Bond insurance; General insurance; Business; Capital adequacy ratio; Casualty insurance; Group insurance; Insurance policy; Cost of capital; Physical capital,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:srs:cfchap:v1-03,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:srs:cfchap:v1-03,lens,001-091-686-525-859

In addition, the paper identifies factors that contribute to the build-up of systemic risk (vulnerabilities), the spreading of contagion and provides a conceptual blueprint linking these phenomena. The author proposes to define systemic risk as the risk that a shock will result in such a significant materialization of (e.g. macrofinancial) imbalances that it will spread on the scale impairing the functioning of financial system and to the extent that it adversely affects the real economy (e.g. economic growth). The blueprint intends to break down and clearly categorize the processes of accumulation, materialization and spreading of systemic risk. This should in turn facilitate its identification and subsequent mitigation by assigning appropriate preventive macroprudential measures.

"Schwarcz, S.L.",The functional regulation of finance,"How should we think about regulating our dynamically changing financial system Existing regulatory approaches have two temporal flaws. The obvious flaw, driven by politics and human nature (and addressed in other writings), is that financial regulation is overly reactive to past crises. This article addresses a less obvious flaw: that financial regulation is normally tethered to the financial architecture, including the distinctive design and structure of financial firms and markets, in place when the regulation is promulgated. In order to effectively address future crises, this article argues, financial regulation must transcend that time-bound architecture. This could be done by regulating the underlying economic functions of the financial system the provision, allocation, and deployment of financial capital as well as the financial system’s capacity to serve as a network within which those functions can be conducted. The article analyzes how to design and implement such a functional approach to financial regulation. Although this approach is primarily normative, it provides regulatory ordering principles that should have practical utility not only as a set of standards to inform actual regulatory design but also as a counterweight to the prevailing view that macroprudential regulation of systemic risk can be adequately served by an ad hoc assortment of regulatory tools.",2014,2014-01-01,3,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Indirect finance; Macroprudential regulation; Financial management; Financial regulation; Financial intermediary; Accounting management; Financial risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2437544,https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/faculty_scholarship/3561/ http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6251&context=faculty_scholarship https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2437544 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2437544 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2451310_code485747.pdf?abstractid=2437544&mirid=1&type=2 https://core.ac.uk/display/62569926 https://core.ac.uk/download/62569926.pdf,lens,010-153-410-746-703

After the change, insurers are less likely to repair regulatory capital by selling distressed MBS, gains trading corporate bonds, or raising external capital.

"Donato, L.; Grasso, R.","The toolkit for the new european banking supervision beyond the banking law, towards the single supervisory mechanism","Policy makers and public opinion are very interested in forthcoming modifications to the institutional architecture of the European banking supervision. However, the improvements to this institutional architecture do not cover the whole area of the interventions put in action to face the financial crisis. A new Directive and a new Regulationthe so-called CRD IV packagerecently released by the European Union aim to deal with the problems stemming from the fragmentation of the prudential regulation adopted by the Member States. The CRD IV package also addresses the need for an unified toolbox available to all the national competent authorities responsible for banking supervision. The paper analyses the following points. First of all, the main features of the Italian Banking Law are closely examined. In this respect, great attention is paid to the toolbox originally provided for the Bank of Italy by the Italian Banking Law released in 1936, that allowed intrusive controls over banks, exerted with a view on the overall financial stability (the so-called structural approach). Then, the increasing importance of the Basel Committee Recommendations and of the subsequent European regulation of the banking industry are highlighted, and the different approach underlying the new Italian Banking Law released in 1993 (the so-called regulatory approach) is explained. The toolkit available to the Bank of Italy is then evaluated and some of his limits investigatednamely the need for specific tools in order to deal with the stability of the financial system as a whole. The financial crisis has urged new interventions. At the European level, a new uniform toolkit has been made available by the CRD IV package, including both corrective measures and sanctions. The CRD IV package also introduces a stronger regulatory framework for the corporate governance of banks and other financial entities, andaddresses the concerns for financial stability with a view to systemic risk. Furthermore, the European Union has recently proposed a Regulationbased on the the so-called Liikanen Reportsetting out rules on structural changes for ""too-big-to-fail banks"" (TBTF), that would impose a ban on speculative activities carried on by those entities. The CRD IV package and the new proposal on structural measures to improve the resilience of credit institutions will be put in action within the new institutional architecture arising from the SSM Regulation. The prospective interference among the ECB and the national competent authorities will be faced taking into account the general clause of fair cooperation among the SSM members. As a final remark, the need for further coordination among the Authorities in charge of financial supervision, in order to face appropriately the increasing interconnectedness among financial entities, is addressed.",2014,2014-01-01,0,,,Accounting; Business; Systemic risk; Law; Sanctions; Financial crisis; Directive; European union; Corporate governance; Financial regulation; Interconnectedness,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:mul:jqmthn:doi:10.1435/76511:y:2014:i:1:p:3-42,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:mul:jqmthn:doi:10.1435/76511:y:2014:i:1:p:3-42 https://ideas.repec.org/a/mul/jqmthn/doi10.1435-76511y2014i1p3-42.html http://ideas.repec.org/a/mul/jqmthn/doi10.1435-76511y2014i1p3-42.html https://www.rivisteweb.it/doi/10.1435/76511,lens,005-147-730-252-495
"Gonzalez-Hermosillo, B.; Johnson, C.A.","Transmission of financial stress in europe the pivotal role of italy and spain, but not greece","This paper proposes a stochastic volatility model to measure sovereign financial distress. It examines how key European sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads affect each other specifically, the paper analyses the volatility structure of Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The stability of Germany is a close proxy for the resilience of the euro area as markets use Germany’s sovereign CDS as a hedge for systemic risk. Although most of the CDS changes for Germany during 2009 12 were due to idiosyncratic factors, market developments in Italy and Spain contributed significantly, likely due to their relative importance in the region.

"Benoît, S.",Trois essais sur le risque syst mique,"Systemic risk has played a key role in the propagation of the last global financial crisis. A large number ofsystemic risk measures have been developed to quantify the contribution of a financial institution to thesystem-wide risk. However, numerous questions about their abilities to identify Systemically ImportantFinancial Institutions (SIFIs) have been raised since systemic risk has multiple facets, and some of themare difficult to gauge, such as the commonalities across financial institutions.The main goal of this dissertation in finance is thus (i) to propose an empirical solution to identifydomestic SIFIs, (ii) to compare theoretically and empirically different systemic risk measures, and (iii)to measure changes in banks’ risk exposures.First, chapteroffers an adjustment of three market-based systemic risk measures, designed in a globalframework, to identify domestic SIFIs. Second, chapterintroduces a common framework in whichseveral systemic risk measures are expressed and compared. It is theoretically shown that those systemicrisk measures can be expressed as function of traditional risk measures. The empirical application confirmsthese findings and shows that these measures fall short in capturing the multifaceted nature of systemicrisk. Third, chapterproposes the Factor Implied Risk Exposures (FIRE) methodology which breaksdown a change in risk disclosure into a market volatility component and a bank-specific risk exposurecomponent. This chapter empirically illustrates that changes in risk exposures are positively correlatedacross banks, which is consistent with banks exhibiting commonality in trading.",2014,2014-12-11,0,,,Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Financial crisis; Financial institution; Capital requirement; Common framework; Financial risk management; Financial risk; Volatility (finance),https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01206685,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01206685/document https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01206685 https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01206685v3,lens,001-436-357-659-793
"Stanková, L.; Bednárová, P.",Use of macro stress testing for the creation of business strategy in the case of the czech republic,"The World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) introduced a program called the Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) in 1999. It is the program that engages in a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of countries' fina ncial stability (IMF, 2014). In the FSAP there were processed first macro stress tests. Macro stress testing has become a part of the tools for testing the ability of the financial system to withstand unexpected shocks. The recent financial crisis drew unprecedented attention to the stress testing of financial institutions. On one hand, stress tests were criticized for having missed many of the vulnerabilities that led to the crisis. On the other hand, after the onset of the crisis, they were given a new role as crisis management tools.The aim of this article is the analysis of the possible use of macro stress tests in the formation of business strategies. The starting point is the assumption of ensuring and maintaining corporate profitability throughout the use of the coming from macro stress tests, especially in times of internal, or possibly external, economic instability.For the analysis are applied the following methodscollection of secondary data from Czech National Bank and their implementation for the creation of strategic business plans by graphic and statistical apparatus. The article is divided into three parts. In the introductory part of the article there is me ntioned a brief analysis of macro stress tests. The following section deals with the particular use of stress tests in the creation of the business strategy. The areas of strategic planning in which the of macro stress tests can be used are included, too. The evaluation of using possibilities is accomplished in the conclusion. The possibility of using the of macro stress tests is described by deductive method in the conclusion.One of the first publications dealing with the theory of macro stress tests was published by the International Monetary Fund (Blaschke et al., 2001). This paper is concerned mainly with explaining the basic steps of testing and the clarification of tested risks. In the EU, the regular conduct of EU-wide stress tests has been envisaged from the start in the legislation setting up the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) from the 2011. The ESAs have made the most extensive use of stress tests, partly because of the greater urgency of addressing weaknesses in the European banking sector, and partly due to the fact that the practice and theory of stress testing for banks is relatively more developed than the tests for insurance companies or markets and financial market infrastructures (ECB 2013). The first mentioning of macro stress tests in the Czech Republic was by Cihak who summarized the issues of stress tests in his work entitled Stress Testing: A Review of Key Concepts (Cihak, 2004). The significance of macro stress tests was manifested primarily with the beginning of the debt crisis in 2008. After this year there have been many other mentions of stress tests and their specific use. For instance, the authors Marcelo, Rodriguez and Trucharte (2008) focused on the contribution of macro stress tests to researching and maintaining financial stability. For the time being, on the margin of interest there remains the use of macro stress tests for creating corporate strategies, which is the content of this article.Macro Stress TestsStress testing is a technique that measures the vulnerability of a portfolio, an institution, or an entire financial system under different hypothetical events or scenarios. It is a quantitative ""what if"" exercise, estimating what would happen to capital, profits, cash flows, etc. of individual financial firms or the system as a whole if certain risks were to materialize (IMF, 2012). A complete stress testing exercise is more than just a numerical calculation of the impact of possible shocks.",2014,2014-09-01,0,International Review of Management and Business Research,,Accounting; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Macro; Financial market; Financial crisis; Debt crisis; Portfolio; Strategic planning; Stress testing (software),https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3446937141/use-of-macro-stress-testing-for-the-creation-of-business,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3446937141/use-of-macro-stress-testing-for-the-creation-of-business http://irmbrjournal.com/papers/1409663045.pdf https://irmbrjournal.com/papers/1409663045.pdf,lens,010-173-077-760-218
"Heitfield, E.",Using trade repository data for systemic risk monitoring,"The 2008 financial crisis revealed significant problems with the functioning of overthe-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. In the years and months leading up to the crisis market participants were able to build up large counterparty risk exposures to AIG Financial Products and other highly interconnected institutions. When these institutions ran into trouble in the fall of 2008, lack of transparency contributed to a breakdown in the functioning of some segments of the OTC swaps market. While most firms presumably had a clear understanding of their own direct exposures to particular troubled institutions, they could not clearly identify the exposures of other potential trading partners to those institutions. Faced with an environment in which they did not know who was at risk and who wasn’t, many market participant simply chose to withdraw from trading for a time, harming market liquidity and thereby making it more difficult for all firms to manage their risks.",2014,2014-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Risk analysis (engineering); Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Trade Repository; Market participant; Derivatives market,http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/bisbisifc/37-46.htm,http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/bisbisifc/37-46.htm,lens,009-307-656-547-732

"Caples, S.C.; Hanna, M.E.; Perdue, G.",Ascertaining the efficient frontier in the classroom,"One common of investments courses is introducing students to the many aspects of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Within MPT students are taught about the efficient frontier of portfolios made up of the set of efficient portfolios. These efficient portfolios are important to the investor because they offer the least amount of risk at each possible rate of return and the best return possible for each level of risk. Any other portfolio will be characterized by higher levels of risk than are necessary to produce any given rate of return. Most university investments courses deal with MPT--and particularly the efficient frontier--from a theoretical stand point. Unfortunately some students have difficulty following the theoretical discussions and so they cannot fully grasp the powerful practical implications found in MPT. Also there are some students who do understand the theory, but have difficulty making the transition to a practical application in the construction of an actual portfolio. Most textbooks fail to address these instructional problems. In this study we present a tutorial on how to use a special function in Microsoft Excel to teach students about MPT. Following the approach presented in this tutorial, the instructor can start with a given set of assets and find the efficient (minimum risk) portfolio for a given rate of return. Students can be asked to find efficient portfolios as well because of the ubiquitous nature of Excel. Once the basic portfolio is developed, the can be modified to present additional constraints on the portfolio to prevent one particular asset from being too heavily weighted. SETTING THE EXAMPLE For simplicity in this tutorial, you are only given five assets to build your portfolio. As such your analysis will ascertain the best portfolio available to the investor given the small set of investment possibilities. However, you will recall that in his analysis Markowitz (1952, 1959) assumed a data set made up of all of the risky assets in the world. While it is a little unrealistic to assume you could actually assemble that data set for an analysis, it is true that the larger your data set the more options are open to you for building a great portfolio. So the odds are that the larger the data set then the better will be the portfolio ultimately derived from your analysis. If one can perform this analysis for the investor with a five asset data set, then the analysis with a 50 or 500 asset database is the same. Markowitz originally presented his theory using standard deviation as the risk measure, and he sought to minimize the constrained non-linear equation for the standard deviation of the portfolio to arrive at efficient portfolios. Later research by Sharpe (1964) simplified the modern investor's work as he introduced beta as the measure of systemic risk in a portfolio. Sharpe's discovery of beta allows the investor to minimize the linear equation for the beta of the portfolio, which many more computer software resources can accommodate. Given below is the initial set of assets with which you will work. Assetcan be thought of as a broad market mutual fund, with the same risk and return as the overall market. The other assets may be other funds or individual investments. The portfolio that you recommend to the investor will be made up of from one to five of these assets. The final portfolio will consist of a certain percentage or weighting of each of these assets, with a weight of zero indicating that the asset is not included in the portfolio. You must solve for the percentages or weights providing the lowest beta and still producing the required rate of return. At the moment these weights are not known. However, this problem can be stated as a linear programming problem and very easily solved in Excel. The basic statement of the problem is: Minimize beta Subject to: Total return of the portfolio must be at least the specified amount The sum of the weights must equal 1.",2013,2013-01-01,1,Journal of Economics and Economic Education Research,,Actuarial science; Economics; Capital asset pricing model; Portfolio optimization; Replicating portfolio; Portfolio; Efficient frontier; Post-modern portfolio theory; Application portfolio management; Modern portfolio theory,http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/ascertaining-the-efficient-frontier-in-the-classroom.pdf,http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/ascertaining-the-efficient-frontier-in-the-classroom.pdf https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-332656011/ascertaining-the-efficient-frontier-in-the-classroom https://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/ascertaining-the-efficient-frontier-in-the-classroom.pdf,lens,009-617-031-965-786
"Petitjean, M.",Bank failures and regulation: a critical review,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to define the key components of an effective regulatory regime. Design methodology approach The paper takes the form of a critical analysis. Findings Regulatory arbitrage has been one of the major factors contributing to the severity of the crisis. Given the ever more complex set of future regulatory constraints, it may keep generating costly negative spillover effects on the whole economy. Moreover, rules-based regulation, however carefully constructed, will unfortunately never prevent bank failures. Neither should it attempt to do so. An effective overall regulatory regime must be sufficiently comprehensive and well-balanced. It must not put too much emphasis on lowering the probability of individual bank failure. The key components of an effective regulatory regime must be: Basel-type rules robust to off-balance-sheet arbitrage little forbearance in monitoring and supervision by regulatory agencies, with a focus on systemic risk control automatic and quick intervention as well as resolution mechanisms. While all components are necessary, none is sufficient and without strong international coordination, none will be effective. Practical implications Enhanced supervision of banks.

"Bushman, R.M.; Williams, C.D.",Delayed expected loss recognition and the risk profile of banks,"This paper investigates the extent to which delayed expected loan loss recognition (DELR) is associated with greater vulnerability of banks to three distinct dimensions of risk: (1) stock market liquidity risk (2) downside tail risk of individual banks and (3) co-dependence of downside tail risk among banks. We hypothesize that DELR increases vulnerability to downside risk by creating expected loss overhangs that threaten future capital adequacy and by degrading bank transparency which increases financing frictions and opportunities for risk-shifting. We find that DELR is associated with higher correlations between bank-level illiquidity and both aggregate banking sector illiquidity and market returns (i.e., higher liquidity risks) during recessions, suggesting that high DELR banks as group may simultaneously face elevated financing frictions and enhanced opportunities for risk-shifting behavior in crisis periods. With respect to downside risk, we find that during recessions DELR is associated with significantly higher risk of individual banks suffering severe drops in their equity values, where this association is magnified for banks with low capital levels. Consistent with increased systemic risk, we find that DELR is associated with significantly higher co-dependence between downside risk of individual banks and downside risk of the banking sector. We theorize that downside risk vulnerability at the individual bank level can translate into systemic risk by virtue of DELR creating a common source of risk vulnerability across high DELR banks simultaneously, which leads to risk codependence among banks and systemic effects from banks acting as part of a herd.",2013,2013-01-01,33,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Financial economics; Systemic risk; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Downside risk; Tail risk; Expected loss; Financial risk management; Monetary economics,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2226964,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2602341_code556992.pdf?abstractid=2226964&mirid=3 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2226964,lens,004-516-012-364-374

"Bianconi, M.; Hua, X.; Tan, C.M.",Determinants of systemic risk and information dissemination,"We study the effects of two measures of information dissemination on the determination of systemic risk. One measure is print-media consumer sentiment based while the other is volatility based. We find evidence that while the volatility measure (VIX) of future expectations has a more significant direct impact upon systemic risk of financial firms under distress, a consumer sentiment measure based on print-media news does impact upon firm's financial stress via the externality of other firm's financial stress. This latter effect is robust even though the VIX and the consumer sentiment have dynamic feedback in the short one and two-day horizon in levels, and contemporaneously in volatility. In reference to the internet bubble of the 1990s, the consumer sentiment measure predicts larger systemic risk in the whole period of exuberance while the VIX predicts a sharp larger systemic risk in the height of the bubble. Our evidence suggests that print-media consumer sentiment might be dominated by the VIX when predicting systemic risk.",2013,2013-12-01,4,Research Papers in Economics,,Consumer confidence index; Economics; Expected shortfall; Externality; Financial economics; Financial stress; Information Dissemination; Monetary economics; Systemic risk; Volatility (finance),https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:tuf:tuftec:0776,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:tuf:tuftec:0776 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2367882 https://ideas.repec.org/p/rim/rimwps/67_13.html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2438445_code424704.pdf?abstractid=2367882&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2438445_code424704.pdf?abstractid=2367882&mirid=1&type=2,lens,008-703-624-529-861

"Avgouleas, E.",Effective governance of global financial markets: an evolutionary plan for reform,"Two questions remain widely open when it comes to global financial markets. First, what is the raison d'etre of open global markets Second, is it possible to foster open markets without an international governance structure supervising them Post-crisis regulatory reform presents an acute paradox. While the content of international financial regulation is changing rapidly, the reform of governance structures is painfully slow. There is no formal governance structure dealing with cross-border supervision of global financial institutions. In addition, there is no crystallized institutional capacity at the international level dealing with cross-border crises and the resolution of global institutions. Other areas of concern are the global supervision of systemic risk and the absence of a reliable finance research watchdog dealing with the production of regulatory standards. This article outlines an international governance framework to deal effectively with these concerns. The adoption of the proposed plan would lead to breaking down the territorial link in the supervision of large financial institutions and of systemic risk, without causing intolerable loss of sovereignty. In addition, the proposed structure is premised on a set of explicit values. These would provide a strong signal to global markets that they need to shift their focus from speculation to development goals.",2013,2013-07-11,3,Global Policy,,Systemic risk; Economics; Sovereignty; Financial market; Regulatory reform; Production (economics); Market economy; Corporate governance; Speculation; Financial regulation; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12041,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12041 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12041 http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/includes/remote_people_profile/remote_staff_profile?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cyLmxhdy5lZC5hYy51ayUyRmZpbGVfZG93bmxvYWQlMkZwdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMlMkYwXzE5ODdfZWZmZWN0aXZlZ292ZXJuYW5jZW9mZ2xvYmFsZmluYW5jaWFsbWFyay5wZGYmYWxsPTE%3D http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/13204289/AVGOULEAS_E_Effective_Governance_of_Global_Financial_Markets_An_Evolutionary_Plan_for_Reform.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/28970244 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/glopol/v4y2013ip74-84.html https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/effective-governance-of-global-financial-markets(55a5dc3c-49be-472c-8c47-6309f92814ae).html https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/13204289/AVGOULEAS_E_Effective_Governance_of_Global_Financial_Markets_An_Evolutionary_Plan_for_Reform.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/28970244.pdf,lens,000-773-462-699-771

"K, L.",Financial constrains and industry competition: the evidences from bond market innovation,"In this paper we exploit the innovation of bond market instrument to the variation of financial constrains of the listed companies and empirically test the effect of financial constraints on industry competition. Financial constraints produce the great influence on industry competition strategy,thus the important problem is if decreasing the firm's financial constraints can make the firm more aggressive in the competition. This problem is important,because the financial constraints can affect the industry output efficiency and the operation of the real economy through firm competition behavior. On the other hand,the more aggressive competition strategy is helpful to improve the level of consumer welfare. Despite the economic theory has explained the impact of financial constraints on competition strategy of the industry,but directly testing this effect is very difficult because of the endogeneity problems in the empirical test. Therefore,it is important for the competition strategy and the efficiency of industry competition to further provide the empirical evidence of the impact of the financial constraints on firm competition.Based on the natural experiment in bond market,we handle the two challenging problems in empirical test for industry competition: the criterion of grouping financial constrains and endogeneity problem. In 2005 the of short-term financing bonds is a kind of financial tool innovation on the bond market,which provides an ideal experimentalFirst,the financial tool innovation helps to solve the endogeneity problem of the financial constraint in empirical research. Second,the financial tool innovation helps to distinguish which firm changed the financial constraints. Based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2002 to 2007,we find the short-term financing bond decreased the financial constrains,the firm increased the selling administration expenses,and the sale growth rate experienced huge increase. These effects are significant both statistically and economically. In two years after the of short-term financing bonds( 2006 2007),compared with the lower credit rating companies,sales and management costs on average increased more than 0. 6% in the higher credit rating companies,i. e.,the higher credit rating firm increase sales and management costs more than 17 million yuan. Sales growth rate in the higher credit rating companies also increased by 8. 6%,i. e.,the firm sales increased an average of more than 160 million yuan. The evidences suggest that bond market innovation has a great impact on financial constrains and the behaviors of industry competition,thus produce an important influence on real economy.Our paper makes three contributions. First,the previous studies about the relationship of financial constraints and industry competition have focused on capital structure and industry competition,and got to the two conflicting ,that is debt commitment effect and predatory effect. Our paper focuses on the assumption of the two theories,reconciles the of two theories,and directly tests the effect of financial constraints on industry competition. Second,based on the natural experiment,we handle the challenging problem in empirical test for financial constraints: the criterion of grouping financial constrains. Most studies group firm into different kinds of financial constraints according to certain firm characteristics,and test the effect of financial constraints on capital structure and industry competition. Unlike these studies,our paper use the financial tool innovation as the external shock to the change of firm's financial constraints,and empirically test the influence of firm financial constraints on the firm's industry competition,the empirical method helps to overcome the endogeneity problem in financial constraints. Third,our paper has practical meaning for the construction of China's bond market. Our evidences suggest that standardized,orderly development of the bond market is helpful to improve the proportion of direct financing,alleviate the financial constraints,and promote the economy development.The efficient financial system can enhance the competitive ability of the firm,and promote the development of the whole economic. Under strict control on financial system,The financial institutions monopolized the financial resource,and can easily get high profits,and are reluctant to provide efficient service to the financial consumers. On the contrary,in a competitive environment,financial institutions are bound to conduct financial innovation to obtain benefits. Although the financial innovation may produce risks which will be passed in financial institutions, but as long as the financial innovation is under strict regulation,these risks won't turn into systemic risk,financial innovation will bring more benefits than harm to economic system. In Chinese financial market,the gradual and reasonable financial innovation will help to improve firm performance and the economic efficiency.",2013,2013-01-01,0,Economic Management Journal,,Finance; Market data; Financial analysis; Economics; Microeconomics; Indirect finance; Position (finance); Financial modeling; Financial intermediary; Financial risk; Financial ratio,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-JJGU201310005.htm,http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-JJGU201310005.htm,lens,004-365-499-839-89X
"Lindblom, T.; Willesson, M.",Financial crisis and EU banks' performance,"The financial crisis at the end of the past decade clearly disclosed the vulnerability of globally interconnected financial systems in times of recession. Financial problems and failures on the US financial market in autumn 2008 almost immediately contaminated financial systems and institutions worldwide. The practical meaning of theoretically defined concepts like systemic risk’ and particularly counterparty risk’ and liquidity risk’ became very apparent and real not only for banks and other financial institutions, but also for their customers and society as a whole. Risk premiums charged on money and capital markets were immediately increased up to levels that made refinancing on these markets extremely expensive. In many countries the financial system was more or less on the verge of collapse without the rescue actions of central banks and governments, it is highly likely that a substantially larger number of banks would have entered into bankruptcy than actually did so. Lind-blom, Olsson and Willesson (2011) report that the guarantee programme introduced into the Swedish market had already been utilized from the start by domestic banks in general, and by one of the four large commercial banks in particular.

"McNamara, S.R.",Financial markets uncertainty and the rawlsian argument for central counterparty clearing of OTC derivatives,"One of the key measures in the Dodd-Frank Act intended to curb systemic risk in the financial system is the central counterparty (CCP) clearing mandate for over-the-counter derivatives. The mandate reflects the belief of legislators and many financial markets experts that these derivatives, particularly credit default swaps, were a key cause of the financial crisis of 2008. While derivative markets do create extensive interconnections between financial institutions, and were essential to the creation of the structured finance securities that fueled the housing bubble, in hindsight it appears that derivatives were not a proximate cause but more likely one of many but for’ structural causes of the crisis. As a result, the CCP clearing mandate has come in for extensive criticism on the grounds that it carries with it significant risks for the global financial system, while providing little benefit in return. This Article offers a critical examination of the arguments against CCP clearing and a defense of the mandate and other Dodd-Frank Title VII derivatives provisions. Beginning with the fundamental uncertainty about the true causes of the crisis that remains, including a strong probable role for a behavioral’ cause of the crisis on account of the panic of financial institutions, it then examines the arguments against CCP clearing, finding that they rely on overly narrow boundaries in order to achieve a measure of precision in making a cost-benefit analysis, thereby ignoring many of the important costs that derivatives indirectly contributed to. Given that a more complete cost-benefit analysis appears to run aground on the complexity of accurately enumerating all the costs and benefits associated with modern financial markets, this Article instead proposes looking at the problem of derivatives regulation through a Rawlsian framework. Central to Rawls’s thought is the procedure of decision-making under conditions of fundamental uncertainty, or the maximin rule.argue that application of the maximin rule is appropriate here, and that unlike the standard cost-benefit analysis grounded in utilitarianism, Rawls’s views lead to a holistic understanding of the financial markets in their larger societal context that both guides and justifies legislative action in the context of fundamental uncertainty by prioritizing the safety of the financial system. Such a holistic understanding of economic regulation is necessary as governments struggle to preserve social stability in the face of widespread economic challenges such as unemployment, income inequality, excessive debt, and continuing instability in the financial system.",2013,2013-01-01,1,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Financial economics; Structured finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Financial crisis; Global financial system; Counterparty; Credit default swap; Derivatives market,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2210965,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2210965_code1556228.pdf?abstractid=2210965&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2210965 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2210965,lens,003-680-908-400-372
"Masciandaro, D.; Passarelli, F.",Financial systemic risk: taxation or regulation,"This paper describes financial systemic risk as a pollution issue. Free riding leads to excess risk production. This problem may be solved, at least partially, either by financial regulation or by taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. However, reality shows that financial regulation is adopted more frequently. This paper makes a positive, politico-economic argument. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners. The same kind of majority may strategically choose regulation in order to burden the minority with a larger share of the cost of reducing systemic risk.",2013,2013-01-01,25,Journal of Banking & Finance,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Financial transaction; Order (exchange); Production (economics); Portfolio; Argument; Financial regulation; Free riding,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2012.09.020,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4096722 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426612002968 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426612002968 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejbfina/v_3a37_3ay_3a2013_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a587-596.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbfina/v37y2013i2p587-596.html https://acle.uva.nl/binaries/content/assets/subsites/amsterdam-center-for-law--economics/workshops--meetings/2011/article-f.-pasarelli-financial-systemic-risk---taxation-or-regulation.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/302163287.pdf,lens,002-691-531-937-176

Recently, the financial crisis has re-awoken interest in regulatory capture’ a term used by the Governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King, among others. In this policy brief, Max Watson, a former director of the Central Bank of Ireland and senior official at the IMF, finds that regulators bought into’ market risk assessments far too extensively, and failed to criticize systemic risks as they built up in banks. The policy brief revisits the idea of regulatory capture to explore the influences that changed financial sector regulation, including new ideological currents, changes in economics and technology, and the incentives affecting legislators and regulators. Whilst the term capture’ may be too one-dimensional to characterize the dynamic process of change that occurred, Watson advocates the need for greater scrutiny at a time when the economic legacy of major regulatory failures may lead governments to rely even more on regulation to secure their policy goals.",2013,2013-01-01,1,,,Political economy; Business; Systemic risk; Ideology; Regulatory capture; Scrutiny; Watson; Financial crisis; Incentive; Market risk,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6b5d7be9-cb24-43d7-99f9-c8d870177141,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6b5d7be9-cb24-43d7-99f9-c8d870177141,lens,008-454-218-169-237
"Baldursson, F.M.; Portes, R.",Gambling for resurrection in iceland: the rise and fall of the banks,"We examine the evolution of the Icelandic banking sector in its macroeconomic environment. The story culminates in the crisis of October 2008, when all three major banks in Iceland collapsed in three successive days. The country is still struggling to cope with the consequences. The paper follows on our report of autumn 2007. The macroeconomic boom that peaked in 2007 led to severe imbalances. The banks had expanded at a rapid pace and reported healthy profits, capital ratios and liquidity until their collapse. An official report (SIC, 2010) has, however, exposed severe weaknesses in the banks’ assets and governance. The Icelandic Financial Services Authority (FSA) clearly knew little of the magnitude of large, single exposures and lending to the banks’ owners, although they strongly maintained otherwise in autumn 2007. Neither the FSA nor the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) saw the systemic risks created by lending to owners and related parties, which increased greatly from September 2007. With the financial turmoil that began in August 2007, the banks’ access to capital markets was curtailed. They then gambled on resurrection, expanding their balance sheets and refinancing the investments of their owners and other big borrowers, while they should have been deleveraging and securing their liquidity positions in foreign currency. The banks also prevented their share prices from collapsing by purchases of their own shares in the stock market, offloading accumulated shares in private deals, usually financed by themselves. All this went on apparently unnoticed by regulators. The Icelandic banks did not buy toxic securities but together, they administered their own potent mix of systemic poison.Only a month before the collapse of October 2008 the banks all reported strong liquidity positions. These reports were misleading, but we also show how financing unravelled over the course of a few days, and collapse became inevitable. The rapid evaporation of liquidity and market funding is one of the key lessons of the story. Whereas the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries had the resources to bail out their irresponsible and illiquid banks, Iceland did not, and it received little foreign help or even sympathy. Iceland’s response to the crisis, with its heterodox policies and aid from the IMF, has been relatively successful.",2013,2013-09-01,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Financial services; Currency; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Market liquidity; Currency crisis; Deleveraging; Capital requirement; Financial system,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/9664.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/9664.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:cpr:ceprdp:9664,lens,000-410-464-546-24X
"Giudici, P.; Spelta, A.",Graphical network models for international financial flows,"The late-2000s financial crisis has stressed the need of understanding the world financial system as a network of countries, where cross-border financial linkages play a fundamental role in the spread of systemic risks. Financial network models, that take into account the complex interrelationships between countries, seem to be an appropriate tool in this context. In this paper we propose to enrich the topological perspective of network models with a more structured statistical framework, that of graphical Gaussian models, which can be employed to accurately estimate the adjacency matrix, the main input for the estimation of the interconnections between different countries. We consider different types of graphical models: besides classical ones, we introduce Bayesian graphical models, that can take model uncertainty into account, and dynamic Bayesian graphical models, that provide a convenient framework to model temporal cross-border data, decomposing the model into autoregressive and contemporaneous networks. The paper shows how the application of the proposed models to the Bank of International Settlements locational banking statistics allows the identification of four distinct groups of countries, that can be considered central in systemic risk contagion.",2013,2013-10-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Network model; Bayesian probability; Systemic risk; Graphical model; Autoregressive model; Financial crisis; Context (language use); Computer science; Identification (information),https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pav:demwpp:demwp0052,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pav:demwpp:demwp0052 https://ideas.repec.org/p/pav/demwpp/demwp0052.html,lens,002-832-753-766-989

"Wang, B.; Sun, T.",How effective are macroprudential policies in china,"This paper investigates macroprudential policies and their role in containing systemic risk in China. It shows that China faces systemic risk in both the time (procyclicality) and cross-sectional (contagion) dimensions. The former is reflected as credit and asset price risks, while the latter is reflected as the links between the banking sector and informal financing and local government financing platforms. Empirical analysis based on 171 banks shows that some macroprudential policy tools (e.g., the reserve requirement ratio and house-related policies) are useful, but they cannot guarantee protection against systemic risk in the current economic and financial environment. Nevertheless, better-targeted macroprudential policies have greater potential to contain systemic risk pertaining to the different sizes of the banks and their location in regions with different levels of economic development. Complementing macroprudential policies with further reforms, including further commercialization of large banks, would help improve the effectiveness of those policies in containing systemic risk in China.",2013,2013-01-01,1,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Off-balance-sheet; Business; Systemic risk; Reserve requirement; Capital adequacy ratio; Asset (economics); Tier 1 capital; Bank rate; Financial system; Financial risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2255870,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2255870,lens,003-763-391-969-665

"Gai, P.",Introduction,"The introductory chapter describes the central thesis of the book, namely that understanding systemic risk in financial systems requires coming to terms with the consequences of network effects, funding liquidity risk, and fire sales of assets by banks in distress. These factors combine to generate fat tails’ in the distribution of aggregate system losses. So while a financial system is robust to most shocks, when problems do arise, the effects can be catastrophic. The chapter also discusses how bank funding structure interacts with network topology, with hysteresis’ resulting from the balance sheet adjustment that ensues when financial institutions are swayed by the opinions of their near neighbours. Recent progress in calibrating model banking systems to assist regulators with their financial stability mandates is also described.",2013,2013-03-28,0,Systemic Risk,,Balance sheet; Market liquidity; Systemic risk; Financial stability; Financial system; Financial distress; Financial crisis; Economics; Business; Monetary economics; Finance; Macroeconomics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199544493.003.0001,,lens,007-430-272-692-499

Theory suggests that banks might benefit from specialization in the form of higher screening and monitoring efficiency, while a diversified loan portfolio might also enhance stability. This paper finds that sectoral specialization increases volatility and systemic risk exposures, while not leading to higher returns.

And it does so from two perspectives. The first one questions the ability of the special regime for derivatives to address inefficiencies in financial markets, notably systemic risk, and draws attention to some social costs which that regime, in turn, originates. The second one deals with a Spanish development: the impact that the sale of interest rate swaps (IRS) to non-financial counter-parties has had in small firms' bankruptcies. The original Spanish regime dealing with derivatives’ safe harbors in line with that in other developed economies has been amended twice in order to subsidize the placement of IRS in the retail market at the expense of other creditors in bankruptcy, essentially in response to less responsive views by Spanish Courts.

"Tabas, I.",Making things stick in the fight against atherosclerosis,"Prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease through systemic risk factor management has had great success, but cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death. One approach to this treatment gap is complementary arterial wall based therapy that inhibits either the trigger of atherosclerosis, lipoprotein retention, or its pathobiological consequences, nonresolving inflammation. A recent article by Kastrup et al describes a technical advance that brings this approach closer to reality. The investigators have developed and validated a drug-eluting adhesive biogel that has the durability and stability to provide chronic therapy directly to plaques in the setting of pulsatile arterial blood flow. This advance expands the opportunity to develop drugs that retard atherosclerotic plaque progression and promote plaque resolution and regression. Currently available therapeutic strategies directed against atherosclerotic vascular disease focus primarily on reducing systemic risk factors, notably hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension. Lipid therapy, particularly with statins, is very effective, because it lowers the probability that apolipoprotein B100 containing lipoproteins (apoB LPs) will enter and be retained in susceptible regions of the arterial wall, which is the trigger for the pathobiological responses that initiate and promote atherogenesis.1 Indeed, if we could imagine a world where everyone’s plasma apoB LP level was maintained at a very low level starting in the early teenage years, which is the age at which atherosclerotic lesions usually first appear, the current leading cause of death would be close to nonexistent.2 However, although tremendous progress has been made in reducing heart disease, this ultimate goal is currently unachievable due to the difficulty of implementing effective lifestyle changes and limitations related to drug safety and compliance. Therefore, translational biomedical researchers have turned their attention to complementary approaches that target atherogenic processes in the arterial wall. It is in this context that we can appreciate a technical advance",2013,2013-04-12,1,Circulation Research,,Intensive care medicine; Compliance (physiology); Inflammation; Hyperlipidemia; Disease; Context (language use); Heart disease; Cause of death; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.113.301227,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circresaha.113.301227 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662540/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3662540,lens,002-891-869-163-530

A macroprudential approach to oversight has been proposed with a view toward mitigating systemic risk and is now being developed.

Using a logit approach to predicting banking crises in 14 OECD countries we find a significant impact of a proxy for the ratio of banks’ off-balance-sheet activity to total (off and on balance sheet) activity, as well as capital and liquidity ratios, the current account balance and GDP growth. These are robust to the exclusion of the most crisis prone countries in our model. For early warning purposes we show that real house price growth is a good proxy for off balance sheet activity prior to the sub-prime episode.

"Bholat, D.; Gray, J.",Organizational form as a source of systemic risk,"Systemic risk"" now occupies centre stage in discussions of bank regulatory reform. Systemic risk is often seen as a problem of size, operational complexity, interconnectivity and contagion. It is less often discussed in terms of the institutional framework of legal rules and principles within which financial intermediation takes place, and the organizational culture promoted by those structures. In this article we redress this deficit through an appraisal of Northern Rock, illustrating the consequences of its transformation from mutually owned building society to publicly held company on organisational culture. These changes had profound effects on the incentive structure of its owners and managers, as profit-maximisation and shareholder value became the driving forces within the firm, as in much of the rest of the UK banking sector. Thus, in addition to grappling with risk and uncertainty and taking care to distinguish between the two current efforts to construct a new macro- prudential regulatory paradigm should recognize the importance of Frank Knight's third key conceptual category-profit. Furthermore, in seeking to understand systemic risk, it becomes necessary to delve into micro-legal concepts such as property, trust, and contract that govern different forms of business to discern whether or not some modes of financial association create a greater degree of systemic risk than others. This is especially so when one organizational model comes to dominate retail markets, as did the publicly held company in the UK banking sector at the turn of the twenty-first century.",2013,2013-06-07,9,Economics,,Business; Systemic risk; Construct (philosophy); Redress; Regulatory reform; Shareholder value; Incentive; Market economy; Financial intermediary; Organizational culture,http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2013-27,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/60492 http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/195063/CCD0D273-C382-470A-AE88-C341BE9DF599.pdf https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/75208/1/749697636.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:ifweej:201327 https://ideas.repec.org/a/zbw/ifweej/201327.html,lens,007-546-720-365-93X

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 80 fundus (right and left eyes) of 40 healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years, (18 M, 22mean age 35.1yrs) who were characterized by determination of retinal arterial tortuosity using a three-level grading scale (straight, wavy, tortuous),after screening for arterial blood pressure and diabetes.Higher grades of tortuosity were common among the study subjects, 20 (25 %) had straight retinal arteries, 24 (30 %) had wavy arteries and 36(45%) had tortuous arteries when reported as the average of right and left eyes because the correspondence between right and left eyes was high. Increasing values of mean arterial blood pressure were associated with decreasing levels of retinal arterial tortuosity even in pre-hypertensive individuals while age, sex and gender did not significantly contribute towards dimorphism. Conclusion: Considerable variations in retinal vasculature in terms of tortuosity can be observed among young healthy subjects. Determinants of disparities in retinal arterial layout are mainly associated with blood pressure levels while age, gender and right vs left laterality do not appear to much affect the wavy patterns of vessels in this study population. Assessment of retinal vascular tortuosity can provide a means of monitoring systemic health to recognize what determines how retinal vessels are laid out early in life, before systemic risk factors and clinical disease have developed.",2013,2013-02-24,0,the Internet Journal of Health,,Anatomy; Internal medicine; Cardiology; Laterality; Fundus (eye); Tortuosity; Retinal; Retinal vascular tortuosity; Diabetes mellitus; Population study; Medicine; Blood pressure,https://ispub.com/IJH/14/1/1368,https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/1368 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tabinda_Hasan/publication/236585752_Retinal_Arterial_Tortuosity_In_Young_Indians_A_Cross_sectional_Study/links/0deec518134715e5fe000000.pdf https://ispub.com/IJH/14/1/1368,lens,009-587-593-361-242

"Genco, R.J.; Borgnakke, W.S.",Risk factors for periodontal disease,"Risk factors play an important role in an individual's response to periodontal infection. Identification of these risk factors helps to target patients for prevention and treatment, with modification of risk factors critical to the control of periodontal disease. Shifts in our understanding of periodontal disease prevalence, and advances in scientific methodology and statistical analysis in the last few decades, have allowed identification of several major systemic risk factors for periodontal disease. The first change in our thinking was the understanding that periodontal disease is not universal, but that severe forms are found only in a portion of the adult population who show abnormal susceptibility. Analysis of risk factors and the ability to statistically adjust and stratify populations to eliminate the effects of confounding factors have allowed identification of independent risk factors. These independent but modifiable, risk factors for periodontal disease include lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. They also include diseases and unhealthy conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and low dietary calcium and vitamin D. These risk factors are modifiable and their management is a major component of the contemporary care of many periodontal patients. Genetic factors also play a role in periodontal disease and allow one to target individuals for prevention and early detection. The role of genetic factors in aggressive periodontitis is clear. However, although genetic factors (i.e., specific genes) are strongly suspected to have an association with chronic adult periodontitis, there is as yet no clear evidence for this in the general population. It is important to pursue efforts to identify genetic factors associated with chronic periodontitis because such factors have potential in identifying patients who have a high susceptibility for development of this disease. Many of the systemic risk factors for periodontal disease, such as smoking, diabetes and obesity, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are relatively common and can be expected to affect most patients with periodontal disease seen in clinics and dental practices. Hence, risk factor identification and management has become a key component of care for periodontal patients.",2013,2013-04-11,725,Periodontology 2000,chronic disease; disease susceptibility; genetic predisposition to disease/genetics; humans; life style; periodontal diseases/etiology; risk factors,Internal medicine; Dentistry; Aggressive periodontitis; Disease; Chronic periodontitis; Metabolic syndrome; Population; Risk factor; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine; Confounding,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0757.2012.00457.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0757.2012.00457.x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23574464/ https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.wiley-prd-v-62-i-1-prd457 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23574464 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0757.2012.00457.x/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23574464,lens,003-171-929-800-935

"Varotto, S.; Zhao, L.",Systemic risk and bank size,"In this paper we analyse aggregate and firm level systemic risk for US and European banks from 2004 to 2012. We observe that common systemic risk indicators are primarily driven by firm size which implies an overriding concern for too-big-to-fail institutions. However, smaller banks may still pose considerable systemic threats, as exemplified by the Northern Rock debacle in 2007. By introducing a simple standardisation, we obtain a new risk measure that identifies Northern Rock as a top ranking systemic institution up toquarters before its bailout. The new indicator also appears to have a superior ability to predict which banks would be affected by the most severe stock price contractions during the 2007-2009 sub-prime crisis. In addition we find that a bank’s balance sheet characteristics can help to predict its systemic importance and, as a result, may be useful early warning indicators.

"Sergueiva, A.","Systemic risk identification, modelling, analysis, and monitoring: an integrated approach","Research capacity is critical in understanding systemic risk and informing new regulation. Banking regulation has not kept pace with all the complexities of financial innovation. The academic literature on systemic risk is rapidly expanding. The majority of papers analyse a single source or a consolidated source of risk and its effect. A fraction of publications quantify systemic risk measures or formulate penalties for systemically important financial institutions that are of practical regulatory relevance. The challenges facing systemic risk evaluation and regulation still persist, as the definition of systemic risk is somewhat unsettled and that affects attempts to provide solutions. Our understanding of systemic risk is evolving and the awareness of data relevance is rising gradually this challenge is reflected in the focus of major international research initiatives. There is a consensus that the direct and indirect costs of a systemic crisis are enormous as opposed to preventing it, and that without regulation the externalities will not be prevented but there is no consensus yet on the extent and detail of regulation, and research expectations are to facilitate the regulatory process. This report outlines an integrated approach for systemic risk evaluation based on multiple types of interbank exposures through innovative modelling approaches as tensorial multilayer networks, suggests how to relate underlying economic data and how to extend the network to cover financial market information. We reason about data requirements and time scale effects, and outline a multi-model hypernetwork of systemic risk knowledge as a scenario analysis and policy support tool. The argument is that logical steps forward would incorporate the range of risk sources and their interrelated effects as contributions towards an overall systemic risk indicator, would perform an integral analysis of ...",2013,2013-10-24,2,"Arxiv: Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science",,Risk analysis (engineering); Business; Systemic risk; Externality; Actuarial science; Scenario analysis; Financial market; Economic data; Financial innovation; Pace; Indirect costs,https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6486,https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6486 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.6486,lens,006-706-358-276-11X

In normal times, institutions’ connections may result in efficient risk transfer. But in crises, connections can facilitate contagion as initial problems lead to chains of defaults and liquidity shortages sparked by shocks which might arise within the financial system or from the real economy. Institutions are also interconnected in indirect ways, since they are exposed to common risk factors that can result in concurrent losses. For example, most banks extend loans secured by real estate: they are thus collectively exposed to falls in house prices. Resulting bank distress can then exacerbate initial problems: banks might simultaneously sell collateral (houses), thus worsening downward price spirals. Less tangibly, institutions can also be connected through perceptions of counterparties’ creditworthiness. Given uncertainty, financial institutions may in general become reluctant to lend to each other and hoard liquidity. Potential for contagion due to interconnectedness is a key component of systemic risk. As a first step towards understanding the mechanisms of contagion, this paper abstracts from complex indirect connections between banks, and rather focuses on direct linkages between 53 large EU banks, based on unique data on interbank exposures collected by national regulators as of the end of 2011.

The design of complex adaptive systems often, if not always, occurs in a context that is uncertain. In addition to the complexity of the system, the systems both affect and are influenced by a social environment containing a large variety of actors. Methods and processes that study the design of such types of systems can help scholars and practitioners to better understand, design and manage complex adaptive systems. The aim in this paper is to provide a methodology useful for designing and controlling systems developed to solve complex adaptive problems.

"Pan, E.J.",Understanding financial regulation,"This Article offers an account of financial regulation that is focused on the types of regulatory strategies that financial regulators employ. Noting the lack of prior academic work in this area, the Article presents a taxonomy of strategies, consisting of rulemaking, supervision, certification, and enforcement, and argues that regulators actively choose between versions of strategies that require their direct input and immediate expenditure of regulatory resources (public regulatory strategies) and strategies that delegate the burden of regulation onto private actors (private regulatory strategies). This choice affects the nature and effectiveness of financial regulation, both in terms of the degree to which financial regulation relies on self-regulation, gatekeepers, private rights of action, and other private strategies and the manner in which the interests of private parties involved in private strategies are aligned with those of the public. As the primary difference between public and private regulatory strategies is the immediate cost to the regulator, this Article further argues that the availability of resources is the primary determinant of the types of regulatory strategies selected by financial regulators. This Article then explores two implications of the role of resource constraints on financial regulation. The first is an explanation for the oft- noted sine curve of regulatory activity, a cyclical pattern of lighter to heavier regulatory activity before and after a financial crisis or scandal. In the aftermath of any such financial crisis or scandal, regulators face intense pressure to demonstrate they are in control of the financial markets and, therefore, rely more on public strategies strategies that give the regulator greater visibility and command. Eventually, however, resource constraints force regulators to seek more cost-effective regulatory strategies, driving them to rely more on private strategies. The second is what happens when regulators cannot easily access private strategies, such as in the case of systemic risk regulation. Under resource constraints, regulators resort to blunter public strategies that are less costly but are not as fine-tuned, such as proposals to create narrow banks or abandon traditional financial regulatory strategies in favor of extraregulatory solutions, such as bank fees and size limitations on financial institutions.",2013,2013-05-15,4,Utah Law Review,,Public economics; Delegate; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Private rights; Financial crisis; Enforcement; Rulemaking; Financial regulation,http://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/ulr/article/viewArticle/952,http://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/ulr/article/viewArticle/952,lens,002-266-038-282-295

"Birchall, A.",Beggar thy neighbouran architecture for systemic risk regulation,"This paper takes the view that the effectiveness of regulatory structures should be measured primarily on efficiency grounds, albeit with significant deference to approaches promoting systemic resilience, given the vast social dislocation associated with financial crises. Based on this premise, the financial regulatory reforms underway fail to address the externalities within the international financial architecture that served to facilitate and exacerbate the development of systemic risk and are, therefore, unlikely to be effective. The oversight of financial markets should move away from nationalistic models towards a much greater degree of international cooperation. The paper thus considers an alternative vision for financial regulation, and in particular a model for systemic risk regulation based around the devolution of substantive hard law power to a newly formed international systemic risk regulator. Conceding that the window of opportunity for such a paradigm shift may have passed now, the paper concludes nonetheless that until nations are prepared to move beyond self-interest, excessive systemic risk will remain latent within the financial system. In particular, the absence of a broad based and neutral approach to regulation is likely to simply drive risk to the deepest recesses of the market, leaving the system superficially safer but in fact more unsound.",2012,2012-01-01,0,New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law,,Psychological resilience; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Beggar thy neighbour; Window of opportunity; Hard law; Deference; Market economy; Public relations; Financial regulation,http://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=210592397175052;res=IELHSS,http://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=210592397175052;res=IELHSS,lens,000-925-984-999-974
"Kremer, M.; Duca, M.L.; Holló, D.",CISSa composite indicator of systemic stress in the financial system,"This paper introduces a new indicator of contemporaneous stress in the financial system named Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS). Its specific statistical design is shaped according to standard definitions of systemic risk. The main methodological innovation of the CISS is the application of basic portfolio theory to the aggregation of five market-specific subindices created from a total of 15 individual financial stress measures. The aggregation accordingly takes into account the time-varying cross-correlations between the subindices. As a result, the CISS puts relatively more weight on situations in which stress prevails in several market segments at the same time, capturing the idea that financial stress is more systemic and thus more dangerous for the economy as a whole if financial instability spreads more widely across the whole financial system. Applied to euro area data, we determine within a threshold VAR model a systemic crisis-level of the CISS at which financial stress tends to depress real economic activity.

"Longworth, D.",Combatting the dangers lurking in the shadows: the macroprudential regulation of shadow banking,"Since the 2008 09 financial crisis, the international regulatory community has taken steps to reduce the probability of future significant financial instability. So far, the emphasis has been on tougher capital and liquidity regulations for banks and greater transparency for financial products, and greater regulation of financial infrastructure such as central counterparties, trade repositories, and the clearing of over-the-counter derivatives. To mitigate the risks of another run on the shadow banking system greatly amplifying financial instability, some shadow banking entities ought to be regulated as banks or in a similar fashion to banks (for example, with capital and liquidity requirements) while in other cases regulation should cover banks’ relationships with them, their procyclical behaviour in certain markets (such as those for repos), or the ratings process for securitized products. Because of the diversity of the various parts of the shadow banking system, the policy responses proposed in this study differ significantly across those parts. Taken together, the implementation of these policies should help reduce systemic risk and the probability of future periods of financial stress, for a stronger and more stable financial system.",2012,2012-01-01,6,C.d.

"Erten, I.; Okay, N.",Deciphering liquidity risk on the istanbul stock exchange,"This paper examines the impact of illiquidity and liquidity risk on expected stock returns in the Turkish stock markets. Using daily data of the ISE-100 stock index from 2005 to 2012 and Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, we test the liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model (L-CAPM) of Acharya and Pedersen (2005). Performing cross-sectional regression tests across test portfolios, we find supporting evidence that illiquidity is significantly and positively priced. Specifically, our indicate that liquidity risk arising from the commonality in liquidity is the most important component of liquidity risk. The strong interrelationship between the market liquidity and the liquidity of individual stocks suggests that market-wide shocks on the Istanbul Stock Exchange might quickly affect every stock in this market. Hence, liquidity commonality might create a systemic risk in which case liquidity shocks can be perfectly correlated across all stocks. Our study is the first to investigate stock liquidity-return relationship at daily frequency and to apply the L-CAPM on the Turkish stock markets. Our findings provide interesting for investors, risk managers and regulators in emerging economies, and in particular, Turkey. Investors should incorporate liquidity risk into their trading and hedging strategies to improve their risk profile and increase their investment returns. Furthermore, an improved understanding of systemic liquidity is vital for regulatory authorities to design improved regulations against systemic shocks.",2012,2012-01-01,0,,,Emerging markets; Business; Systemic risk; Capital asset pricing model; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Stock exchange; Monetary economics; Stock (geology); Stock market index,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/56148.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/56148.html,lens,000-060-743-905-084
"Capponi, A.; Larsson, M.",Default and systemic risk in equilibrium,"We develop a finite horizon continuous time market model, where risk-averse investors maximize utility from terminal wealth by dynamically investing in a risk-free money market account, a stock, and a defaultable bond, whose prices are determined via equilibrium. We analyze the endogenous interaction arising between the stock and the defaultable bond via the interplay between equilibrium behavior of investors, risk preferences and cyclicality properties of the default intensity.

The single cause is attributed to the economic paradigm which drives individual behaviour, business, government and education. We define the economic paradigm and explain its power to drive endogenous economic processes, ultimately leading to the course of events which is recognised as the crisis. The paradigm assumes that economic instabilities are exogenous events thus allowing governments to ignore processes with systemic risks which emerged from excessive debt and asset bubbles. We suggest that the solution to this and future crises requires a new economic paradigm, where understanding endogenous crisis is one of its central s.

"Nicolo, G.D.; Favara, G.; Ratnovski, L.",Externalities and macroprudential policy,"The recent financial crisis has led to a reexamination of policies for macroeconomic and financial stability. Part of the current debate involves the adoption of a macroprudential approach to financial regulation, with an aim toward mitigating boom-bust patterns and systemic risks in financial markets. The fundamental rationale behind macroprudential policies, however, is not always clearly articulated. The contribution of this paper is to lay out the key sources of market failures that can justify macroprudential regulation. It explains how externalities associated with the activity of financial intermediaries can lead to systemic risk, and thus require specific policies to mitigate such risk. The paper classifies externalities that can lead to systemic risk as: 1. Externalities related to strategic complementarities, that arise from the strategic interaction of banks (and other financial institutions) and cause the build-up of vulnerabilities during the expansionary phase of a financial cycle 2. Externalities related to fire sales, that arise from a generalized sell-off of financial assets causing a decline in asset prices and a deterioration of the balance sheets of intermediaries, especially during the contractionary phase of a financial cycle and 3. Externalities related to interconnectedness, caused by the propagation of shocks from systemic institutions or through financial networks. The correction of these externalities can be seen as intermediate targets for macroprudential policy, since policies that control externalities mitigate market failures that create systemic risk. This paper discusses how the main proposed macroprudential policy tools capital requirements, liquidity requirements, restrictions on activities, and taxes address the identified externalities. It is argued that each externality can be corrected by different tools that can complement each other. Capital surcharges, however, are likely to play an important role in the design of macroprudential regulation. This paper’s analysis of macroprudential policy complements the more traditional one that builds on the distinction between time-series and cross-sectional dimensions of systemic risk.",2012,2012-01-01,18,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Market failure; Balance sheet; International economics; Financial networks; Macroprudential regulation; Capital requirement; Financial regulation; Monetary economics; Financial intermediary,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2083302,https://ssrn.com/abstract=2083302 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2083302_code341289.pdf?abstractid=2083302&mirid=2 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3078739,lens,007-483-587-898-204

A number of disorders associated with reduced blood flow and ischaemia, collectively termed vascular risk factors, such as migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, atrial fibrillation and reduced nocturnal blood pressure, lead to decreased ocular perfusion pressure. During sleep, alterations occur in cardiovascular physiology that are balanced by autoregulation to maintain homeostasis. However, in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the normal physiological balance is upset. A potentially modifiable risk factor, OSA has been increasingly associated with glaucoma independent of intraocular pressure. OSA may alter blood flow to the optic nerve head and, in combination with other predisposing factors, lead to decreased ocular perfusion pressure. This in turn may directly affect the optic nerve or it may indirectly increase its susceptibility to other insults.

Intermediaries face risk-based funding constraints that give rise to procyclical leverage. The pricing of risk varies as a function of intermediary leverage, and asset return exposure to intermediary leverage shocks earns a positive risk premium. Relative to an economy with constant leverage, financial intermediaries generate higher consumption growth and lower consumption volatility in normal times, at the cost of endogenous systemic financial risk. The severity of systemic crisis depends on intermediaries’ leverage and net worth.

"Darolles, S.; Dudek, J.; Fol, G.L.",Liquidity contagion the emerging sovereign debt markets example,"Emerging economies have passed an important stress test during the period 2008-09 and are now the key drivers for global growth of the world economy. Financial markets are today so interconnected that they are fragile to contagion. The issue of financial contagion was historically concerning Emerging Markets (EM). These latter attract foreign investors and massive investments funds in -and out- flows on very short horizons can be a source of contagion effects between markets. The analysis of the sovereign debt markets and particularly related CDS markets is of interest since it is at the very center of a new phenomenon: banks are not anymore the main source of systemic risk but sovereign economies are. As foreign investors represent the most of the volume traded, capital flows in these markets should also impact FX market. Their analysis is thus also central to this study. Indeed, the main risk for an asset manager is to get stuck with unwanted sovereign debt due to a dry up of market liquidity. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis of contagion looking at common markets liquidity problems to detect funding liquidity problems. We use the Credit Default Swap bond spread basis and the deviations from the Covered Interest Parity as liquidity measures respectively for sovereign debt and FX markets. Moreover, we distinguish interdependence and pure contagion using a state-space model with a time-varying volatility specification and we apply it to both returns and liquidity indicators.",2012,2012-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Emerging markets; Economics; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Financial market; Funding liquidity; Financial contagion; Credit default swap; Monetary economics; Interest rate parity,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-01632803.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-01632803.html,lens,007-761-758-145-934
"Agénor, P.; Silva, L.A.P.d.","Macroeconomic stability, financial stability, and monetary policy rules","This paper reviews arguments for and against attributing explicitly a financial stability to monetary policy. The discussion is conducted from the perspective of middle-income countries (MICs), where bank credit plays a critical role both on the supply and demand sides. It also discusses, assuming that a more proactive role is desirable, what monetary policy should react to, to what extent it should be combined with macroprudential regulation (and possibly capital controls), and whether existing models provide adequate benchmarks for studying how these policies interact. The analysis suggests that, on balance, there may be a good case for monetary policy in MICs to go beyond its conventional mandate and address the time dimension of systemic risk if only during a transitory period, as more is learnt about the implementation and performance of the new macroprudential rules that are currently being discussed. There are robust arguments in favor of monetary policy reacting in a state contingent fashion to a (private sector) credit growth gap measure, not only because of financial stability considerations but also because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding real time estimates of the output gap in MICs. Nevertheless, monetary policy is not a substitute to macroprudential regulation because monetary policy cannot, in any event, address the cross-section dimension of systemic risk, and because MICs often face circumstances (e.g., sudden floods) where it could have undesirable side effects if used as an exclusive policy instrument.",2012,2012-08-21,35,International Finance,,Supply and demand; Private sector; Monetary policy; Macroeconomics; Systemic risk; Economics; Mandate; Output gap; Macroprudential regulation; Monetary economics; Capital (economics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2362.2012.01302.x,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:intfin:v:15:y:2012:i:2:p:205-224 http://www.ferdi.fr/sites/www.ferdi.fr/files/publication/fichiers/P29_Agenor_Perreira_web.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/intfin/v15y2012i2p205-224.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2362.2012.01302.x,lens,001-052-568-836-38X

"Silver, N.; Pant, S.",Regulation without reason: the deleterious effects of government regulation on private pension provision,"In this article, the history of regulation in pensions in the United Kingdom is analysed, in particular with respect to defined benefit occupational pension schemes. A framework of criteria for effective legislation is developed. The original prudent person rule provided a good framework for legislation, but most subsequent regulation that has been enacted does not meet our criteria. Recently regulation has increased the cost and risk of individual schemes and the systemic risk in the system as a whole. The article finds that, in totality, regulation has been disastrous for these schemes, contributing to their demise. The article concludes by briefly outlining how effective regulation might have developed to produce a flexible and resilient system. 2012 The Authors.

It is assumed that hyperglycemia is one of the major systemic risk factors for diabetic complications. Numerous hypotheses exist to enlighten the adverse effect of hyperglycemia. One of these hypotheses is the activation of the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinasesignaling pathway by hyperglycemia which subsequently mediates cellular response and affects gene expression and protein function to cause cellular dysfunction and damage. It is well known that the intracellular protein kinaseactivation is achieved by the elevated diacylglycerol levels in vascular tissues as well as in nonvascular tissues. Besides diacylglycerol, oxidative stress has also been reported to induce prolonged activation of protein kinasewithin cells through the reactive oxygen species. Activation of protein kinaseand oxidative stress have been associated with vascular alterations such as increases in permeability of endothelial cells, extracellular matrix synthesis, cell growth and apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cytokines activation and inhibition. These derangements in vascular cell homeostasis caused by the activation protein kinaseas well as oxidative stress are connected to the occurrence of pathologies affecting large vessel and small vessel complications. Accumulating evidences have also shown that the inflammation process is an essential pathogenetic mechanism in diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, modulation of this process is an important target for both metabolic and hemodynamic derangements in diabetic nephropathy.

"Arinaminpathy, N.; Kapadia, S.; May, R.M.",Size and complexity in model financial systems,"The global financial crisis has precipitated an increasing appreciation of the need for a systemic perspective toward financial stability. For example: What role do large banks play in systemic risk How should capital adequacy standards recognize this role How is stability shaped by concentration and diversification in the financial system We explore these questions using a deliberately simplified, dynamic model of a banking system that combines three different channels for direct transmission of contagion from one bank to another: liquidity hoarding, asset price contagion, and the propagation of defaults via counterparty credit risk. Importantly, we also introduce a mechanism for capturing how swings in confidence in the system may contribute to instability. Our highlight that the importance of relatively large, well-connected banks in system stability scales more than proportionately with their size: the impact of their collapse arises not only from their connectivity, but also from their effect on confidence in the system. Imposing tougher capital requirements on larger banks than smaller ones can thus enhance the resilience of the system. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in more concentrated systems, and continue to apply, even when allowing for potential diversification benefits that may be realized by larger banks.

We develop a novel measure of bank interconnectedness using syndicated corporate loans. Interconnectedness is positively related to both bank size and diversification diversification, however, matters more than size. We find that interconnectedness is positively correlated with various bank-level systemic risk measures including SRISK, CoVaR, and DIP, and such a positive correlation mainly arises from an elevated effect of interconnectedness on systemic risk during recessions. Using a market-level measure of systemic risk, CATFIN, we also find that interconnectedness increases aggregate systemic risk during recessions.

"McConnell, P.J.",Systemic operational risksmoke and mirrors,"Christmas 2009 did not bring much festive cheer to the shareholders of Australia's largest banks. On December 23rd, the so-called Four Pillars announced simultaneously that their subsidiaries in New Zealand had settled with the NZ Inland Revenue Department (IRD), in respect of long-running litigation that resulted in payments of unpaid tax and interest totaling some NZ$ 2.2 Billion. The settlement followed a finding in October 2009, in the High Court of New Zealand, in favor of the local tax authorities as regards a series of 'Structured Finance Transactions', which the IRD claimed were specifically designed to avoid paying tax in New Zealand. The transactions in dispute, which numbered only around 30 across the four banks, were, at face value, highly complex and intricate but when stripped of the 'smoke and mirrors' were little more than standard commercial loans. The profitability, or otherwise, of these disputed transactions depended very much on how profits, losses and tax were accounted for. Because of various tax treaties between New Zealand and Australia, the Australian parents of NZ banks are able, under certain circumstances, to offset operating losses against profits being repatriated from New Zealand. This, in effect, could turn a loss-making transaction into a powerful device for shielding profits from tax, for both the borrower and the lender. The Inland Revenue argued that the tax benefit was, in fact, the 'tax tail that wagged the commercial dogin such transactions. New Zealand courts at various levels agreed with this interpretation and unanimously found that the banks concerned were using these transactions to avoid paying tax.This paper argues that the losses to the Australian banks incurred as a result of the NZ Tax Scandal were, in most part, a result of Systemic Operational Risk, in particular, Legal Risk. Using examples from published court cases, the paper identifies some of the Legal Risks that arose using these transactions.

In this paper we estimate the systemic risk contribution of each financial institution in a large sample of European banks. We follow a recent methodology first proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) based on the CoVaR and find that size is a predictor of a bank contribution to systemic risk, but it is not the only one. Leverage is important as well. Also, banks that have their headquarters in countries with a more concentrated banking system tend to contribute more to European wide systemic risk, even after controlling for their size. Therefore, any financial regulation designed only to curb banks’ size would not completely eliminate systemic risk. On average, balance sheet variables are very weak predictors of banks’ contribution to systemic risk, if compared to market based variables. Accounting rules provide enough degrees of freedom to make balance sheet less informative than market prices. As a result, measures of risk based on higher frequency market prices are more likely to anticipate systemic risk.",2012,2012-01-01,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Business; Systemic risk; Balance sheet; Financial institution; Market based; Banking sector; Financial regulation; Monetary economics; Market price; Leverage (finance),https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:lui:casmef:1211,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:lui:casmef:1211 https://iris.luiss.it/handle/11385/58658 http://static.luiss.it/RePEc/pdf/casmef/1211.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/p/lui/casmef/1211.html,lens,007-726-653-764-268

Our proposal would require that a small fraction of each MMF investor amp x27recent balances, called the amp x27 minimum balance at risk amp x27 (MBR), be demarcated to absorb losses if the fund is liquidated. Most regular transactions in the fund would be unaffected, but redemptions of the MBR would be delayed for 30 days. A key feature of the proposal is that large redemptions would subordinate a portion of an investor amp x27MBR, creating a disincentive to redeem if the fund is likely to have losses. In normal times, when the risk of MMF losses is remote, subordination would have little effect on incentives. We use empirical evidence, including new data on MMF losses from the U.S. Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to calibrate an MBR rule that would reduce the vulnerability of MMFs to runs and protect investors who do not redeem quickly in crises.",2012,2012-01-01,1,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/feds.2012.47,,lens,010-013-411-438-812
"Haugen, I.K.",The puzzle of generalized osteoarthritis (OA) is OA a systemic enthesopathy,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common condition that has a major influence on patients’ health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, the riddle concerning the pathogenesis of the disease is still not solved. Generally, we believe that OA is a failure of the whole joint caused by a combination of systemic risk factors and local biomechanical factors1,2. Hand OA is frequent in persons with OA in the larger joints, and may represent a marker of a generalized susceptibility to OA. Kellgren and Moore suggested the concept of generalized OA in the early 1950s3, and numerous later studies have confirmed an association between hand and knee OA and to a lesser extent hip and spine OA4,5,6. Recently, the association was confirmed with modern imaging techniques demonstrating an association between radiographic joint space narrowing in the finger joints and reduced knee cartilage thickness, and between osteophytes in the finger joints and radiographic knee OA7. Although there is ample evidence of an association between hand and knee OA, there is still no consensus about the definition of generalized OA8. The underlying mechanisms beyond this association are not fully understood, although genetic, hormonal, nutritional, neurological, and autoimmune mechanisms have been suggested. Further, one cannot rule out that the observed association is due to common environmental risk factors for hand and knee OA. In this issue of The JournalGibson, et al explore the concept of generalized OA and ask whether the disease is related to a systemic enthesopathy9. Entheses are defined as the insertion sites of tendons, ligaments, fascia, or the articular capsule into bone10. The term enthesopathy refers to any pathological involvement of the entheses, including inflammatory, metabolic, traumatic, or degenerative processes.

In this study we addressed the molecular and cellular effects of elevated and suppressed levels of circulating cholesterol on the normal prostate. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was performed using DNA microarray data from two experimental formats: (1) ventral prostate from male mice with chronically elevated circulating cholesterol and (2) human prostate cells exposed acutely to cholesterol depletion. A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels.

Several empirical and theoretical studies have focused on the role of the interbank market in causing contagion in financial crises. In this regard, one frequent problem encountered in dealing with contagion risk in the banking system is that only data on interbank credits and debts aggregated at bank level are publicly available, whereas the whole matrix of interbank linkages would be needed in order to estimate systemic risk correctly. One common solution is to assume that banks maximise the dispersion of their interbank credits and debts, so that the interbank matrix can be approximated by its maximum entropy. This paper tests the influence of this hypothesis on simulations by verifying if variations in the structure of the interbank matrix lead to significant changes in the magnitude of contagion. In order to do this, an algorithm was developed that generates interbank matrices with higher concentration. Then a Monte Carlo simulation was run by making use of the SYMBOL model (SYstemic Model of Banking Originated Losses) jointly developed by the JRC, DG MARKT, and experts of banking regulation (see De Lisa et al., 2010). We than compared obtained using the maximum entropy approximated matrix with those obtained from more concentrated matrices. Numerical experiments, performed on samples of banks from four European countries, highlight that concentration in interbank loans does affect but that, when considering the probability distribution of losses, even significant changes in the interbank matrix do not deeply affectHow to obtain EU publications Our priced publications are available from EU Bookshop (http: bookshop.europa.eu), where you can place an order with the sales agent of your choice.

"Sankaran, H.; Saxena, M.; Erickson, C.",Average conditional volatility: A measure of systemic risk for commercial banks,"We propose using the cross-sectional (daily) average conditional volatility of commercial bank stock returns as a measure of systemic risk for the U.S. banking industry. The performance of this measure is tested using data from the 2008 pre-crisis period. The measure is shown to incorporate individual bank risk as well as the cumulative riskiness of a cross-section of banks. Cross-sectional regressions indicate that individual bank’s probability of default is unrelated to the bank’s conditional volatility during times of low, industry wide risk (as measured by average conditional volatility). However, the bank’s conditional volatility significantly affects its probability of default when the industry is experiencing a high level risk. Regardless of the industry level risk, a bank’s probability of default has a significant negative relation with its capital adequacy (as measured by the proportion of equity capital). Additionally, at an aggregate level, Granger causality tests indicate that the conditional volatility of big’ banks causes the riskiness of medium and small banks to increase.",2011,2011-01-27,0,Journal of Business & Economics Research (jber),,Financial economics; Forward volatility; Volatility smile; Econometrics; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Volatility swap; Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; Implied volatility; Probability of default; Volatility risk premium,http://dx.doi.org/10.19030/jber.v9i2.1819,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harikumar_Sankaran/publication/265354043_Average_Conditional_Volatility_A_Measure_Of_Systemic_Risk_For_Commercial_Banks/links/54a2a9da0cf267bdb9041fd9.pdf?disableCoverPage=true https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harikumar_Sankaran/publication/265354043_Average_Conditional_Volatility_A_Measure_Of_Systemic_Risk_For_Commercial_Banks/links/54a2a9da0cf267bdb9041fd9.pdf http://www.cluteinstitute.com/ojs/index.php/JBER/article/view/1819 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268111489.pdf,lens,006-432-376-322-460

Fresh regulations on liquidity ratios are likely to have the most severe impact on subsidiary funding relationships with a typically large reliance on wholesale markets. Provisions on capital quality and coverage are unlikely to represent significant impediments to existing business models but could have an impact on the region should excess capital coverage be reduced to the benefit of parents. Given the benefits from financial integration in terms of growth and financial stability, application of Basel III within emerging Europe should be based on sound coordination of prudential regulation and implementation, including in measures directed at systemic risks.",2011,2011-01-01,6,,,Business; Systemic risk; Basel I; Market liquidity; Basel III; Financial integration; Capital requirement; European union; Financial regulation; Financial system,https://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/economics/workingpapers/wp0132.pdf,https://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/economics/workingpapers/wp0132.pdf,lens,005-171-491-898-001

A crucial element of this task is the treatment of systemic risk. Basel III gains centre stage in this process. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate Basel III, examining its ability to reduce systemic risk.Design methodology approach The paper highlights the importance of reducing systemic risk to achieve the goal of overall financial stability. By first focusing on the theoretical foundations of systemic risk, this paper explores and analyzes the crucial aspects of this almost impalpable risk type. It further investigates the current regulation of systemic risk, clearly showing Basel II's inability to reduce it. Then, it evaluates the Basel Committee's efforts to address these weaknesses through Basel III by investigating its incentives and its ability to reduce obvious drawbacks of Basel II as well as systemic risk factors.Findings The findings show that there are still adjustments necessary.

The clinical picture is typically characterized by very painful skin lesions and ulcerations following calcification and occlusion of small cutaneous arterioles. CUA is life-threatening due to infections and concomitant cardiovascular diseases. Methods We performed a literature search for the terms calciphylaxis and calcific uremic arteriolopathy and summarized current state-of-the-art knowledge about pathophysiology, clinical picture, course of the disease, as well as treatment options. We have filled out the literature data with our personal treatment experiences. A combination of various local and systemic risk factors are necessary to cause the development of calciphylaxis. This pathophysiological cascade is still incompletely understood. Patients with advanced CKD and dialysis patients are especially at risk to develop CUA. Regarding therapy, no randomized prospective trials are available, and treatment is rather based on pathophysiological considerations as well as on evidence derived from case reports or case series. Therapy focuses on optimized dialysis treatment, control of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder parameters, experimental anticalcification strategies and wound care. Conclusion Facing the still deleterious outcome of patients with calciphylaxis, further studies on prophylaxis as well as treatment are urgently needed.

"Gordon, J.N.; Muller, C.",Confronting financial crisis: dodd-frank's dangers and the case for a systemic emergency insurance fund,"The inherent tensions in the financial sector mean that episodes of extreme stress are inevitable, if unpredictable. This is so even if the regulatory and supervisory regimes are in many respects effective. The capacity of government to intervene may determine whether the distress is confined to the financial sector or breaks out into the real economy. Although adequate resolution authority to address a failing financial firm is a necessary of the current regulatory reform, a firm-by-firm approach will be unable to address a major systemic failure such as the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, which may require capital support of the financial sector to avoid severe economic harm. We therefore propose the creation of a Systemic Emergency Insurance Fundthe Fund( SEIF ), scaled appropriately to the size of the US economy, $1 trillion. The facility should be funded (and partially pre-funded) by risk-adjusted assessments on all large financial firms, including hedge funds, that benefit from systemic stability. Treasury would administer the Fund, use of which would be triggered by a triple key concurrence among Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve. Unlike a taxpayer bailout, such a fund would mutualize systemic risk among financial firms through a facility overseen by the regulators. The funding mechanism will give financial firms new incentives to warn regulators of growing systemic risk. Such standby emergency authority avoids the need for high stakes legislative action mid-crisis, which can be destabilizing even if successful and catastrophic if not. Such an approach is superior to the financial sector nationalization strategy that is found in the newly enacted Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform.",2011,2011-01-01,8,Yale Journal on Regulation,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Hedge fund; Taxpayer; Regulatory reform; Financial crisis; Bailout; Treasury; Incentive,https://paperity.org/p/83380475/confronting-financial-crisis-dodd-franks-dangers-and-the-case-for-a-systemic-emergency,https://paperity.org/p/83380475/confronting-financial-crisis-dodd-franks-dangers-and-the-case-for-a-systemic-emergency https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1320&context=yjreg https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjreg/vol28/iss1/4/,lens,005-534-073-940-158

"Agarwal, V.",Guest editorial: special issue on hedge funds,"Hedge funds have gained significant importance in capital markets across the world and are a subject of constant media attention. However, due to the limited regulatory and disclosure requirements for hedge funds, there is a need for better understanding of these investment vehicles that have become a significant part of the financial services industry. The five articles in this special issue are aimed towards achieving thisThese articles cover important topical areas related to hedge funds including response of hedge funds to recent financial crisis, modeling the risk-adjusted performance of hedge funds, role of hedge funds in corporate governance, design of optimal compensation contract for hedge fund managers, and examination of hedge funds’ activities in the primary lending market.am now going to briefly describe each of the articles included in this issue. In the first paper titled The Financial Crisis and Hedge Fund Returnsauthor Nicolas P.B. Bollen asks an important question: Can we learn something about the onset of financial crisis from the changes in strategies and cross-sectional return distribution of hedge funds Bollen finds intriguing answers to this question. There is a substantial increase in the explanatory power from linear factor models during the crisis period for two reasons. First, hedge funds move away from idiosyncratic strategies to investing in more liquid assets using traditional investment strategies. Second, there is an increase in the correlation across different asset markets in the wake of the financial crisis. Moreover, Bollen shows discontinuity in hedge fund returns, suggesting that funds avoid reporting losses during the financial crisis to prevent large-scale withdrawal by investors. The findings in this paper should be important in understanding the systemic risk and operational risk associated with hedge fund activities.",2011,2011-04-23,0,Review of Derivatives Research,,Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Open-end fund; Alternative beta; Commodity pool; Hedge fund; Fund of funds; Global assets under management; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11147-011-9063-8,https://paperity.org/p/59323330/guest-editorial-special-issue-on-hedge-funds https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/revdev/v14y2011i2p115-116.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11147-011-9063-8 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:kap:revdev:v:14:y:2011:i:2:p:115-116 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/kaprevdev/v_3a14_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a115-116.htm https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11147-011-9063-8.pdf,lens,000-512-202-931-073
"Faria, L.G.d.; Phelps, S.",ICECan investigation of the consequences of basel III using an agent-based model,"Many recent agent-based models of financial markets are single-asset models which do not consider risk-management strategies in which agents can invest in both riskless and risky assets. This makes them unsuitable for exploring the implications of regulatory proposals such as Basel III which require agents to balance their exposure to risk by maintaining a minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. In this paper, we will introduce an agent-based model of a financial market in which agents can invest in both risky and riskless assets. We will first validate our model against the empirically-observed stylized facts of financial time-series data and then we proceed to investigate the counter-factual implications of the Basel III proposals for systemic risk. We will also use our model to make testable predictions about the consequences of Basel III which we shall revisit if and when the regulation is implemented.",2011,2011-08-03,3,Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Electronic Commerce,,Operational risk; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Financial market; Basel III; Agent-based model; Stylized fact; Financial regulation; Capital (economics),http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2378104.2378131,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2378104.2378131 https://doi.org/10.1145/2378104.2378131 https://icec11.csc.liv.ac.uk/PaperArchive/0060.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ACMicec/icec2011.html#FariaP11 https://core.ac.uk/display/20607622 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2378104.2378131,lens,006-589-761-159-554
"Borio, C.",Implementing a macroprudential framework: blending boldness and realism,"There is now a broad consensus in the policy community that strengthening the macroprudential orientation of regulatory and supervisory frameworks is essential for the promotion of financial stability. The window of opportunity to put in place fully fledged macroprudential frameworks should not be missed. Meeting this challenge calls for a finely balanced blend of boldness and realism. Boldness is required to face the hard design questions head-on realism to avoid overreach and to manage expectations. Policymakers should be as ambitious as possible, but no more. In all this, research has an important role to play in allowing the framework to grow at a pace commensurate with our knowledge. This speech considers how to strike the balance between boldness and realism in several aspects of the framework: in the criterion for judging its success in how closely systemic risk should be tracked in the mix between an aggregate and a sectoral approach in that between rules and discretion and in governance arrangements.

"Engle, R.F.",Long-Term skewness and systemic risk,"Financial risk management has generally focused on short-term risks rather than long-term risks, and arguably this was an important component of the recent financial crisis. Econometric approaches to measuring long-term risk are developed in order to estimate the term structure of value at risk and expected shortfall. Long-term negative skewness increases the downside risk and is a consequence of asymmetric volatility models. A test is developed for long-term skewness. In a Merton style structural default model, bankruptcies are accompanied by substantial drops in equity prices. Thus, skewness in a market factor implies high defaults and default correlations even far in the future corroborating the systemic importance of long-term skewness. Investors concerned about long-term risks may hedge exposure as in the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM). As a consequence, the aggregate wealth portfolio should have asymmetric volatility and hedge portfolios should have reversed asymmetric volatility. Using estimates from VLAB, reversed asymmetric volatility is found for many possible hedge portfolios such as volatility products, long- and shortterm treasuries, some exchange rates, and gold.JEL: G01)",2011,2011-07-01,73,Journal of Financial Econometrics,,Financial economics; Econometrics; Economics; Capital asset pricing model; Downside risk; Financial risk management; Expected shortfall; Financial risk; Financial correlation; Volatility (finance); Value at risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbr002,https://www.stern.nyu.edu/rengle/EngleLongTermSkewness.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/jfinec/v9y2011i3p437-468.html https://academic.oup.com/jfec/article-abstract/9/3/437/842122 http://jfec.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1093/jjfinec/nbr002 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/oupjfinec/v_3a9_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a437-468.htm http://www.stern.nyu.edu/rengle/EngleLongTermSkewness.pdf,lens,001-811-280-438-897

"Schumacher, L.B.; Barnhill, T.M.",Modeling correlated systemic liquidity and solvency risks in a financial environment with incomplete information,"This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology for modeling correlated systemic solvency and liquidity risks for a banking system. Using a forward looking simulation of many risk factors applied to detailed balance sheets for a 10 bank stylized United States banking system, we analyze correlated market and credit risk and estimate the probability that multiple banks will fail or experience liquidity runs simultaneously. Significant systemic risk factors are shown to include financial and economic environment regime shifts to stressful conditions, poor initial loan credit quality, loan portfolio sector and regional concentrations, bank creditors' sensitivity to and uncertainties regarding solvency risk, and inadequate capital. Systemic banking system solvency risk is driven by the correlated defaults of many borrowers, other market risks, and inter-bank defaults. Liquidity runs are modeled as a response to elevated solvency risk and uncertainties and are shown to increase correlated bank failures. Potential bank funding outflows and contractions in lending with significant real economic impacts are estimated. Increases in equity capital levels needed to reduce bank solvency and liquidity risk levels to a target confidence level are also estimated to range frompercent to 20 percent of assets. For a future environment that replicates the 1987-2006 volatilities and correlations, we find only a small risk of U.S. bank failures focused on thinly capitalized and regionally concentrated smaller banks. For the 2007-2010 financial environment calibration we find substantially elevated solvency and liquidity risks for all banks and the banking system.",2011,2011-01-01,1,Imf Working Papers,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Loan; Solvency; Default; Market risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.5089/9781463924614.001,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/_wp11263.ashx https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Modeling-Correlated-Systemic-Liquidity-and-Solvency-Risks-in-a-Financial-Environment-with-25356,lens,006-084-240-969-929
"Gritsevskyi, A.; Ermoliev, Y.",Modeling technological change under increasing returns and uncertainty,"The aim of this paper is to analyze methodological challenges involved in modeling of endogenous technological changes with increasing returns and uncertainties by using stylized versions of models. Realistic versions of these models are analytically intractable making it difficult to comprehend the interplay of different assumptions on their outcomes. We demonstrate path-dependences of myopic evolutionary approaches, the infeasibility of straightforward trial-and-error processes, and the need for adequate long-term policy assistance. We also show why increasing returns and uncertainties radically offset the rationale for postponed investments in new technologies and how stochastic models cope with systemic risks implicitly induced by interdependencies among uncertainties, technologies, the structure of models, and decisions. The paper demonstrates possible misleading character of alternative models of uncertainties. It shows the need for proper modeling of long-term random horizons, corresponding discounting, security constraints and requirements of robustness by using systemic valuations and distribution free stochastic programming optimization.",2011,2011-10-17,3,Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems,,Stochastic modelling; Stochastic programming; Technological change; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Actuarial science; Economics; Returns to scale; Robustness (economics); Stylized fact; Discounting,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22884-1_6,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-22884-1_6 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/10086/ https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-22884-1_6,lens,003-814-765-275-64X

"Kritzman, M.; Li, Y.; Page, S.; Rigobon, R.",Principal components as a measure of systemic risk,"The U. S. government’s failure to provide adequate oversight and prudent regulation of the financial markets, together with excessive risk taking by some financial institutions, pushed the world financial system to the brink of systemic failure in 2008. As a consequence of this near catastrophe, both regulators and investors have become keenly interested in developing tools for monitoring systemic risk. But this is easier said than done. Securitization, private transacting, complexity, and flexible accounting prevent us from directly observing the many explicit linkages of financial institutions. As an alternative, the authors introduce a measure of implied systemic risk, the absorption ratio, which equals the fraction of the total variance of a set of asset returns explained or absorbed by a fixed number of eigenvectors. The absorption ratio captures the extent to which markets are unified or tightly coupled. When markets are tightly coupled, they are more fragile in the sense that negative shocks propagate more quickly and broadly than when markets are loosely linked.",2011,2011-07-31,265,the Journal of Portfolio Management,,Business; Systemic risk; Government; Set (psychology); Measure (mathematics); Financial market; Securitization; Risk taking; Asset return; Monetary economics,http://dx.doi.org/10.3905/jpm.2011.37.4.112,http://jpm.pm-research.com/content/37/4/112 http://www.systemic-risk-hub.org/papers/bibliography/KritzmanPageRigobon_2011_Preview.pdf https://jpm.iijournals.com/content/37/4/112 http://www.bertrand-maillet.net/bibliography/KritzmanPageRigobon_2011_Preview.pdf https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/37/4/112 https://www.systemic-risk-hub.org/papers/bibliography/KritzmanPageRigobon_2011_Preview.pdf,lens,008-620-705-366-714
"Payne, J.",Private equity and its regulation in europe,"In the fifteen year period to 2008, the private equity industry grew enormously in Europe, to the point where it began to be seen as a rival to the public markets. This gave rise to concerns and calls for the private equity industry to be regulated. The financial crisis, and in particular the contraction of the market for debt prompted by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, has led to a significant reduction in the number and value of private equity deals. However, if anything, the financial crisis has led to increased calls for regulation of the industry. This paper examines the development of private equity transactions in Europe, and analyses the nature of these transactions. It then considers whether the concerns raised in relation to private equity are justified. Broadly, the arguments in favour of regulation of private equity may be divided into two kinds: the need to increase transparency in the industry by imposing disclosure obligations, and systemic risk concerns. These arguments are considered, and the terms of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) are examined in the light of these issues. It is argued that the arguments in favour of regulation of private equity are weaker than has been suggested and that this Directive does not adequately differentiate between hedge funds and private equity when imposing this regulatory regime.",2011,2011-01-01,15,European Business Organization Law Review,,European Union law; Debt; Alternative investment; Business; Systemic risk; Hedge fund; Transparency (market); Financial crisis; Market economy; Private equity,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1566752911400021,https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1017%2FS1566752911400021.pdf http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1566752911400021 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1017/S1566752911400021 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-business-organization-law-review-ebor/article/private-equity-and-its-regulation-in-europe/71D659CA317195C7AE30EEF8402186E2 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1017%2FS1566752911400021.pdf,lens,002-314-339-911-167

The article argues that the creation of the ESAs and ESRB is a proportional response to the increased integration of EU financial markets and the cross-border nature of systemic risk.

"Verhelst, Stijn.","Renewed financial supervision in europefinal or transitory egmont paper no 44, march 2011","Executive summary. The financial crisis underscored both the importance of financial supervision, as well as its pre-crisis malfunctioning. In response, substantive reforms have been carried out in Europe and elsewhere. This paper discusses the renewed financial supervision system in Europe, which fully entered into effect in January 2011. It examines supervisory reforms at the EU-level and considers the role of national, cross-border and international supervision. The paper finds that the reforms undoubtedly lead to a strengthening of EU powers, both by the creation of an EU macro-prudential supervisor (the European Systemic Risk Board) and the reinforcement of three EU micro-prudential supervisory bodies (the European Supervisory Authorities). The EU’s role will even grow over time. The role of cross-border and international supervision has equally increased. Nevertheless, the heart of financial supervision remains firmly at the national level, as national supervisors conduct the bulk of supervisory tasks. Such Member State dominance is in sharp contrast with the state of EU financial sector integration. Yet, a substantial shift to EU supervision is currently unfeasible, due to legal constraints and to Member States’ financial sector crisis management responsibilities. The inability to align financial supervision with financial sector integration could result once again in supervisory failings. If so, a difficult choice between genuinely europeanising financial supervision (with the subsequent legal and fiscal implications) or cutting back the single market arises.

The index is based on daily public market data collected from four sectors of the financial markets credit markets, foreign exchange markets, equity markets, and interbank markets. A dynamic weighting method is employed to capture changes in the relative importance of these four sectors as they occur. In addition, the design of the index allows the origin of the stress to be identified. We compare the CFSI to alternative indexes using a detailed benchmarking methodology and show how the index can be applied to systemic stress monitoring and early warning system design. To that end, we investigate alternative stress signaling thresholds and frequency regimes and establish optimal frequencies for filtering out market noise and idiosyncratic episodes. Finally, we quantify a powerful CFSI-based rating system that assigns a probability of systemic stress to ranges of CFSI outcomes.",2011,2011-01-01,41,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Weighting; Financial market; Equity (finance); Early warning system; Financial stress; Financial risk; Benchmarking,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1917727,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1917727_code894380.pdf?abstractid=1917727&mirid=3 https://ssrn.com/abstract=1917727 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1957405 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1957405 https://ssrn.com/abstract=1957405,lens,010-092-425-623-742

It is often marked by swings in credit growth, asset prices, terms of access to external funding, and other financial developments. A single measure that summarised such indicators would simplify analysis of the financial cycle, with benefits for both systemic risk assessment and stabilisation policy. It is not obvious, however, how best to select and combine the many potentially relevant indicators or how the usefulness of the resulting measure might be assessed. One criterion is predictive power. This special feature reviews the power of three differently composed measures to predict output fluctuations up to two years ahead. One of the measures is found to have substantial predictive content for output forecasting at short horizons.

"Carvalho, d.; Gustavo, S.",The rise of credit default swaps and the changing political environment of sovereign debt markets,"In the last decade, the market for Credit Derivative Swaps (CDS) has greatly increased in size from a relatively small beginning in the mid-1990s. According to estimates, the gross notional amount of CDS instruments outstanding increased fromtrillion US Dollars at the end of 2002 to more than 30 trillion by the end of 2009, after reaching a peak of 58 trillion in 2007. Although a large part of the CDS market is concentrated on credit instruments related to or issued by private debtors in the US domestic market such as bonds and loans of US corporations and mortgages a sizable portion of the CDS currently traded is derived from debt instruments issued by sovereign debtors. After the latest financial crisis in the US, and the spectacular failures of financial institutions that were active traders in credit derivatives such as Lehman Brothers and AIG, the attention of scholars, policymakers, and the public has turned to the role of CDS in promoting instability in both national and international financial markets. Consequently, a lot of attention has been paid to market size and concentration, and the systemic risks thereof. However, relatively little is known about its organization and functioning outside some finance and Economics circles, and even less is known about its impacts on state policies. Moreover, the political science literature on the political impact of credit derivatives is very limited at best. In part, this is understandable, given the recent history of the development of CDS and the small size of the market at the time of the last major sovereign credit event in history, the Argentine Crisis of 2001. But this also means that the current literature on CDS, due to its biases and concerns, has neglected important questions about the politics of derivatives: what are the political and redistributional consequences of financial instruments such as CDS on the countries at the periphery of the system How CDS affect the access of sovereign debtors to capital and, more importantly, their agency and autonomy vis-a-vis their creditors How CDS affects the power structure of the broader international market Since the CDS market is an important and interesting case understudied in political science, my paper focuses on the development of CDS connected to sovereign debt instruments to tackle such questions.describe and analyze how CDS developed and their main functions in the broad capital market.then move on to the relationship between sovereign borrowers and lenders, and map the main political issues raised by CDS: their effects on the agency of states and their creditors, the changes they introduced to the preferences of market participants, and their impact on (i) the production of knowledge in the market, (ii) the access to and distribution of capital and other resources such as information, (iii) the formation of prices, and (iv) the general distribution of power in the market.

Other reliable methods with lower side effects and shorter test duration are being investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the nasal provocation test (NPT) and the basophil activation test (BAT) in the diagnosis of different subtypes of aspirin sensitivity. Methods Thirty aspirin sensitivity patients with cutaneous and respiratory manifestations underwent NPT and BAT with lysine-ASA. NPT result was interpreted as recommended in EAACI GA2LEN guidelines and receiver operating characteristic analysis of BAT was performed by using 15 NSAIDs tolerant volunteers as a control group. NPT was positive in 60% (18 30) of patients and BAT was positive in 76.7% (23 30) of patients. The incubation of basophils with 0.31 mg ml of lysine-aspirin and using 4.6% activated basophils gives the best predictive values to diagnose aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests yielded positive in 80% and 93.3% of aspirin-induced cutaneous and respiratory patterns. The agreement between NPT and BAT was 63.3%. NPT and BAT are beneficial to detect patients with aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests have additional diagnostic values less time-consuming than OPT and their complications are negligible. A reliable alternative method with minimum side effects is needed to diagnose aspirin sensitivity in suspected patients who have contraindications for OPT.,2011,2011-04-13,12,Allergologia Et Immunopathologia,"adolescent; adult; aged; anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroidal/adverse effects; aspirin/adverse effects; asthma, aspirin-induced/diagnosis; basophil degranulation test; female; humans; male; middle aged; nasal provocation tests; sensitivity and specificity; single-blind method; young adult",Internal medicine; Surgery; Young adult; Nasal provocation test; Aspirin; Drug allergy; Basophil activation; Aspirin sensitivity; Gold standard (test); Respiratory system; Medicine; Gastroenterology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aller.2010.12.011,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21492991 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3904863 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21492991 https://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-allergologia-et-immunopathologia-105-articulo-the-values-nasal-provocation-test-S0301054611001170 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301054611001170,lens,006-450-139-453-239

Derivative instruments are powerful tools for market participants to conduct market speculation, which may help hedging, market making and completing investment market. However, pure and excessive speculation might cause net loss of market efficiency and create external costs. Some speculative transactions may imply asymmetric information. Market speculation might also lead to market abuse and even systemic risk. These reasons provide the basis to regulate market speculation by derivatives trading. This paper argues that Taiwan law might build on current regulatory model centring on the type of financial institution and devise legal rules to restraint the amount of speculative transactions and to avoid risk from spreading in order to contain problems from market speculation. In addition, in the retail market, Taiwan law might employ a certain degree of direct product regulation in order to clarify terms of relevant derivative contracts and the rights and obligations of parties in order to reduce the negative consequences of speculation investment by way of derivative instruments.",2010,2010-11-01,0,Social Science Research Network,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1832129,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1832129,lens,005-259-336-334-341
"Hanson, S.G.; Kashyap, A.K.; Stein, J.C.",A macroprudential approach to financial regulation,"Many observers have argued the regulatory framework in place prior to the global financial crisis was deficient because it was largely microprudential in nature (Crockett, 2000 Borio, Furfine, and Lowe, 2001 Borio, 2003 Kashyap and Stein, 2004 Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein, 2008 Brunnermeier et al., 2009 Bank of England, 2009 French et al., 2010). A microprudential approach is one in which regulation is partial-equilibrium in its conception, and aimed at preventing the costly failure of individual financial institutions. By contrast, a macroprudential approach recognizes the importance of general-equilibrium effects, and seeks to safeguard the financial system as a whole. In the aftermath of the crisis, there seems to be agreement among both academics and policymakers that financial regulation needs to move in a macroprudential direction. According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke (2008): Going forward, a critical question for regulators and supervisors is what their appropriate ""field of vision"" should be. Under our current system of safety-and-soundness regulation, supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation. An alternative approach, which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight, would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well.",2010,2010-01-01,91,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Strategic financial management; Systemic risk; Economics; Indirect finance; Inter-dealer broker; Mandate; Financial crisis; Financial regulation; Financial system; Mark to model,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1708173,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1708173 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1708173 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1708173_code753937.pdf?abstractid=1708173&mirid=2 https://core.ac.uk/display/21326751,lens,005-043-466-154-450

This measure explicitly takes into account the indirect exchange rate risk that banks undertake when they lend to borrowers that will not be able to repay in the event of a sharp depreciation. Such systemic risk taking is not captured by indicators that are based only on banks' balance sheet data. The new measure is constructed for 10 emerging European economies and for a broader sample that includes 19 additional emerging economies, for the period 1998-2008. Comparisons with previous currency mismatch measures that do not adjust for unhedged foreign currency borrowing illustrate the advantages of the new approach. In particular, the new measure flagged the indirect currency mismatch vulnerabilities that were building up in a number of emerging economies before the recent global crisis. Measuring currency mismatch more accurately can help country authorities in their efforts to address vulnerabilities at the right time, avoiding hurting growth prospects.",2010,2010-11-01,2,Social Science Research Network,,Emerging markets; Currency; Business; Systemic risk; Foreign exchange risk; Financial crisis; Rate risk; Monetary economics; Devaluation; Depreciation,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1763659,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1763659 https://ssrn.com/abstract=1763659,lens,002-163-164-910-588
"Scherer, F.M.",A perplexed economist confronts 'Too big to fail',"This paper, written for a conference at the Fordham University Law School, examines various facets of the too big to fail debate. It notes that in the current context, too big to fail may imply systemic risks from large financial institution size, compensating economies of scale, political power, and (within narrower markets) power to set prices above competitive levels. It examines three stylized facts: the contours of the recent merger wave among financial institutions, the concomitant increase in the concentration of financial institution assets, and the impressive rise in financial institutions profits as a share of all U.S. corporate profits,. It argues that rising aggregate concentration of financial institutions assets may imply rise in the power to set above-competitive prices in individual relevant banking markets i.e., in segments of what economists call product characteristics space. There is not much solid economic evidence on this last conjecture for investment banking firms, but supporting evidence from the large number of studies focusing on commercial banks is marshaled. The evidence on economies of scale is also imperfect, but it implies that breakup of the largest banks need not cause great efficiency losses.",2010,2010-04-01,2,Research Papers in Economics,,Systemic risk; Investment banking; Economics; Financial institution; Context (language use); Too big to fail; A share; Economies of scale; Stylized fact; Monetary economics,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/4454151.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/4454151.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ecl:harjfk:rwp10-007,lens,003-066-980-807-185
"Stein, J.L.","Alan greenspan, the quants and stochastic optimal control","Alan Greenspan's paper (March 2010) presents his retrospective view of the crisis. His theme has several parts. First, the housing price bubble, its subsequent collapse and the financial crisis were not predicted either by the market, the FED, the IMF or the regulators in the years leading to the current crisis. Second, financial intermediation tried to function on too thin layer of capital high leverage owing to a misreading of the degree of risk embodied in ever more complex financial products and markets. Third, the breakdown was unpredictable and inevitable, given the ""excessive"" leverage or low capital of the financial intermediaries. The proposed legislation for the ""reform"" of the financial system requires that the FED ""identify, measure, manage and mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States"". The focus is upon capital requirements or debt ratios. The ""Quants"" ignored systemic risk and just focused upon risk transfer in very liquid markets. The FED, IMF, Treasury and the ""Quants"" market lacked the appropriate tools of analysis to answer the following questions: what is an optimal leverage or capital requirement that balances the expected growth against risk What are theoretically founded early warning signals of a crisis The author explains why the application of stochastic optimal control (SOC) dynamic risk management is an effective approach to determine the optimal degree of leverage, the optimum and excessive risk and the probability of a debt crisis. The theoretically derived early warning signal of a crisis is the excess debt ratio, equal to the difference between the actual and optimal ratio. The excess debt starting from 2004-05 indicated that a crisis was most likely.

"Acharya, V.V.; Mehran, H.; Thakor, A.V.",Caught between scylla and charybdis regulating bank leverage when there is rent seeking and risk shifting,"Banks face two moral hazard problems: asset substitution by shareholders (e.g., making risky, negative net present value loans) and managerial rent seeking (e.g., investing in inefficient pet projects or simply being lazy and uninnovative). The privately-optimal level of bank leverage is neither too low nor too high: It balances effi ciently the market discipline imposed by owners of risky debt on managerial rent-seeking against the asset-substitution induced at high levels of leverage. However, when correlated bank failures can impose significant social costs, regulators may bail out bank creditors. Anticipation of this generates an equilibrium featuring systemic risk in which all banks choose inefficiently high leverage to fund correlated assets. A minimum equity capital requirement can rule out asset substitution but also compromises market discipline by making bank debt too safe. The optimal capital regulation requires that a part of bank capital be unavailable to creditors upon failure, and be available to shareholders only contingent on good performance.",2010,2010-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Debt; Business; Systemic risk; Asset (economics); Bailout; Moral hazard; Market discipline; Capital requirement; Monetary economics; Leverage (finance),https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/8822.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/8822.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:fip:fednsr:469,lens,006-809-012-712-81X
"Singh, M.","Collateral, netting and systemic risk in the OTC derivatives market","To mitigate systemic risk, some regulators have advocated the greater use of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.",2010,2010-04-01,14,Social Science Research Network,,Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Collateral; Capital levy; Financial system; Financial risk; Capital (economics); Derivatives market,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1590712,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/wp1099.pdf?abstractid=1590712&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1590712 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/wp1099.pdf?abstractid=1590712&mirid=1&type=2,lens,000-503-522-589-700

By combining customer transactions and credit bureau data from January 2005 to April 2009 for a sample of a major commercial bank's customers, we are able to construct out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R-squared's of forecasted realized delinquencies of 85%. Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses.

"Brunetti, C.; Filippo, M.d.; Harris, J.H.",Effects of central bank intervention on the interbank market during the subprime crisis,"We explore whether central bank intervention improves liquidity in the interbank market during the current subprime crisis with unique trade and quote data from the e-MID, the only regulated electronic interbank market in the world. Central bank intervention consistently creates greater uncertainty in the interbank market. Prior to the crisis, the cover-to-bid ratio effectively conveys good and bad news from the central bank, but this link is broken during the crisis, suggesting that standard (and special) interventions that do not specifically target interbank asymmetric information fail to improve market liquidity. Our suggest that the central bank should release stress tests for individual banks, provide interbank loan guarantees, or engage in direct asset purchases rather than simply providing more capital when counterparty risk poses systemic risk to the interbank market.

"Malherbe, F.",Essays on the macroeconomic implications of information asymmetries,"Along this dissertationpropose to walk the reader through several macroeconomicimplications of information asymmetries, with a special focus on financialissues. This exercise is mainly theoretical:develop stylized models that aimat capturing macroeconomic phenomena such as self-fulfilling liquidity dry-ups,the rise and the fall of securitization markets, and the creation of systemic risk.The dissertation consists of three chapters. The first one proposes an explanationto self-fulfilling liquidity dry-ups. The second chapters proposes a formalizationof the concept of market discipline and an application to securitizationmarkets as risk-sharing mechanisms. The third one offers a complementaryanalysis to the second as the rise of securitization is presented as banker optimalresponse to strict capital constraints.Two concepts that do not have unique acceptations in economics play a centralrole in these models: liquidity and market discipline.The liquidity of an asset refers to the ability for his owner to transform it intocurrent consumption goods. Secondary markets for long-term assets play thusan important role with that respect. However, such markets might be illiquid dueto adverse selection.In the first chapter,show that: (1) when agents expect a liquidity dry-upon such markets, they optimally choose to self-insure through the hoarding ofnon-productive but liquid assets (2) this hoarding behavior worsens adverse selection and dries up market liquidity (3) such liquidity dry-ups are Pareto inefficientequilibria (4) the government can rule them out. Additionally,showthat idiosyncratic liquidity shocks a la Diamond and Dybvig have stabilizing effects,which is at odds with the banking literature. The main contribution of thechapter is to show that market breakdowns due to adverse selection are highlyendogenous to past balance-sheet decisions.I consider that agents are under market discipline when their current behavioris influenced by future market outcomes. A key ingredient for market disciplineto be at play is that the market outcome depends on information that is observablebut not verifiable (that is, information that cannot be proved in court, andconsequently, upon which enforceable contracts cannot be based).In the second chapter, after introducing this novel formalization of marketdiscipline,ask whether securitization really contributes to better risk-sharing:I compare it with other mechanisms that differ on the timing of risk-transfer. Ifind that for securitization to be an efficient risk-sharing mechanism, it requiresmarket discipline to be strong and adverse selection not to be severe. This seemsto seriously restrict the set of assets that should be securitized for risk-sharingmotive.Additionally,show how ex-ante leverage may mitigate interim adverse selectionin securitization markets and therefore enhance ex-post risk-sharing. Thisis interesting because high leverage is usually associated with excessive risktaking.In the third chapter,consider risk-neutral bankers facing strict capital constraints their capital is indeed required to cover the worst-case-scenario losses.In such a set-up,find that: 1) banker optimal autarky response is to diversifylower-tail risk and maximize leverage 2) securitization helps to free up capitaland to increase leverage, but distorts incentives to screen loan applicants properly 3) market discipline mitigates this problem, but if it is overestimated bythe supervisor, it leads to excess leverage, which creates systemic risk. Finally,I consider opaque securitization andshow that the supervisor: 4) faces uncertaintyabout the trade-off between the size of the economy and the probabilityand the severity of a systemic crisis 5) can generally not set capital constraintsat the socially efficient level.",2010,2010-09-02,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Financial economics; Market impact; Information asymmetry; Systemic risk; Economics; Liquidity crisis; Market liquidity; Liquidity risk; Market discipline; Leverage (finance),https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ulb:ulbeco:2013/210085,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:ulb:ulbeco:2013/210085 https://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/210085/Holdings,lens,000-722-734-356-79X
"Choi, P.; Min, I.",Estimating the covar for korean banking industry,"The concept of CoVaR introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009) is a useful tool to measure the risk spillover effect. It can capture the risk contribution of each institution to overall systemic risk. While Adrian and Brunnermeier rely on the quantile regression method in the estimation of CoVaR, we propose a new estimation method using parametric distribution functions such as bivariate normal and SU-normal distribution functions. Based on our estimates of CoVaR for Korean banking industry, we investigate the practical usefulness of CoVaR for a systemic risk measure, and compare the estimation performance of each model. Empirical show that bank makes a positive contribution to system risk. We also find that quantile regression and normal distribution models tend to considerably underestimate the CoVaR (in absolute value) compared to SU-normal distribution model, and this underestimation becomes serious when the crisis in a financial system is assumed",2010,2010-01-01,2,Kdi Journal of Economic Policy,,Business; Banking industry; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.23895/kdijep.2010.32.3.71,https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001482540 https://www.koreascience.kr/article/JAKO201024236535428.page https://www.koreascience.kr:443/article/JAKO201024236535428.pdf,lens,005-533-729-745-087

ARBITRATION OF SECURITIES CLASS-ACTION CLAIMS AFTER THE MOTION-TO-DISMISS STAGE IV. ALLOWING NEW ISSUERS TO ELECT ARBITRATION AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING CONCLUSION In the aftermath of the global economic collapse of 2008, policymakers from around the world have been considering regulations designed to reduce the risk of future economic turmoil. Their focus has been on powers and procedures designed to reduce systemic risk and to help ensure financial stability in the world markets. (1) Although policymakers should explore prophylactic measures and use counterfactual reasoning, they should not confine their analysis to preventing the next crisis. Regulating against the risk of unpredictable disaster--a so-called ""black swan"" (2)--is imprecise and, if done improperly, can hinder economic growth. Along these lines, policymakers must be cautious to avoid a regulatory overreaction to the current economic problems. (3) In an effort to promote long-term economic prosperity, policymakers should avoid the temptation to overregulate in the near term. Policymakers also must alleviate unnecessary burdens to economic growth, both in the United States and abroad. But a monetary response, such as a stimulus spending package, provides only short-term economic relief and could cause a host of problems not discussed in this Article. To promote long-term and sustainable growth, policymakers must consider regulatory measures designed to facilitate capital formation and encourage investment, while providing appropriate safeguards against fraud to investors. Of course, the legal and regulatory systems may pose the greatest impediment to economic growth. (4) The United States has its own unique hindrance to economic growth: private securities class-action litigation. Along with Canada and Australia, the United States is one of three G-20 nations to permit securities class actions. (5) Although originally envisioned as a means to provide relief to aggrieved investors, securities class-action litigation has become an inefficient and grossly incomplete means of redress for investors, a costly encumbrance to businesses, and a threat to capital formation in the United States. To be sure, access to a properly administered class-action framework provides aggrieved plaintiffs with a valuable legal recourse. Despite the drawbacks, class actions--as opposed to individual actions--are necessary to avoid the collective action problem that exists when investors accrue claims against publicly held corporations. In the absence of a class action, an individual shareholder might have little incentive to litigate an alleged securities law violation because he would be forced to bear all the costs of litigation while receiving only a fraction of the potential benefits paid to all shareholders. Class-action litigation avoids the collective action problem by allowing a class of shareholders, following the efforts of lead plaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorneys, to share the costs and benefits of a unified action proportionately. The problem with the existing class-action framework in the United States is the overuse and abuse of the litigation system. The magnitude of securities class-action litigation in the United States is astonishing. Nearly half of all class-action lawsuits in 2004 involved allegations of federal securities law violations.",2010,2010-05-07,1,Social Science Research Network,,Initial public offering; Issuer; Capital market; Investment banking; Arbitration; Actuarial science; Economics; Law and economics; Class action; Broker-dealer; Private placement,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601305,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1601305_code1326961.pdf?abstractid=1601305&mirid=1 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1601305 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601305,lens,009-965-636-612-044
"Gerrard, R.; Tsanakas, A.",Failure probability under parameter uncertainty,"In many problems of risk analysis, failure is equivalent to the event of a random risk factor exceeding a given threshold. Failure probabilities can be controlled if a decisionmaker is able to set the threshold at an appropriate level. This abstract situation applies, for example, to environmental risks with infrastructure controls to supply chain risks with inventory controls and to insurance solvency risks with capital controls. However, uncertainty around the distribution of the risk factor implies that parameter error will be present and the measures taken to control failure probabilities may not be effective. We show that parameter uncertainty increases the probability (understood as expected frequency) of failures. For a large class of loss distributions, arising from increasing transformations of location-scale families (including the log-normal, Weibull, and Pareto distributions), the article shows that failure probabilities can be exactly calculated, as they are independent of the true (but unknown) parameters. Hence it is possible to obtain an explicit measure of the effect of parameter uncertainty on failure probability. Failure probability can be controlled in two different ways: (1) by reducing the nominal required failure probability, depending on the size of the available data set, and (2) by modifying of the distribution itself that is used to calculate the risk control. Approach (1) corresponds to a frequentist regulatory view of probability, while approach (2) is consistent with a Bayesian personalistic view. We furthermore show that the two approaches are consistent in achieving the required failure probability. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of data pooling and its systemic risk implications.",2010,2010-12-22,19,Risk Analysis : an Official Publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,"equipment and supplies/supply & distribution; financial management; floods; models, theoretical; probability; risk assessment; uncertainty",Bayesian probability; Systemic risk; Econometrics; Frequentist inference; Weibull distribution; Risk factor (finance); Risk analysis; Event (probability theory); Mathematics; Value at risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01549.x,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/5979/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21175720 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21175720/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/riskan/v31y2011i5p727-744.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01549.x https://core.ac.uk/download/76980579.pdf,lens,004-271-461-971-126

We study the effects of different network structures for systemic risk and welfare depending on whether financial institutions issue long or short term debt. Clustered networks where banks hold very similar portfolios are compared with unclustered networks where they hold less correlated portfolios. The network structure plays a role only in the case of short term financing, when investors condition their debt rollover decision on a signal revealing potential future bank defaults. We show that, depending on the size of costs banks incur when they default, the arrival of a negative signal can lead to early liquidation in a clustered network but not in an unclustered one so the latter can be superior. But if such a signal leads to early liquidation in both networks then the clustered network can be superior.",2010,2010-01-01,94,,,Business; Debt; Default; Diversification (finance); Economics; Finance; Financial crisis; Financial networks; Financial system; Macroeconomics; Network structure; Portfolio; Systemic risk; Welfare,http://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w16177,http://apps.eui.eu/Personal/Carletti/financial_connections_and_systemic_risk-15may10-tabs-figs-final.pdf http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/papers/10/10-20.pdf http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/download/Vita/Financial%20connections%20and%20systemic%20risk-with-figs-tables-01july10-final.pdf http://www.eief.it/files/2010/05/ana-babus.pdf http://www.nber.org/papers/w16177 http://www.nber.org/papers/w16177.ack https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/40102 https://core.ac.uk/display/15798180 https://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/download/Vita/Financial%20connections%20and%20systemic%20risk-with-figs-tables-01july10-final.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=1666109 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1666109 https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/3120950/2010_23S.pdf https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/financial-connections-and-systemic-risk https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:eui:euiwps:ECO2010/30 https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/altri-atti-seminari/2010/Carletti_Financial_Connections_and_Systemic_Risk.pdf https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atilburguniversity.edu%3Apublications%2Fa0b338ca-5b3b-48f9-964f-d4181c2c4e56 https://www.nber.org/papers/w16177 https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w16177/w16177.pdf https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1666109,lens,007-420-675-075-015
"Valverde, S.C.",Financial crisis and regulation: the case of spain,"There have been a number of heterogeneous and, in some cases, opposing views of how the reform of the present international financial architecture should be tackled. This chapter discusses and reassesses the principal challenges and proposals for the reform of international financial regulation, commenting upon some specific lessons for the Spanish case from recent empirical evidence. From an international perspective, consensus is broadest that the most appropriate way to avoid systemic risk escaping from the perimeter of regulation and generating shadow banking is coordination at the national international level and prompt corrective action, which in the EU has led to a combination of both microprudential and macroprudential policies (contained in the Larosiere Report). From a national perspective, the chapter provides empirical evidence suggesting the existence of a relationship between excessive credit expansion in the years prior to the crisis and the current problems of asset impairment. It can be observed that the greater demands of prudential supervision and the dynamic provisions of the Bank of Spain have so far been able to attenuate only part of the effects of asset impairment. Nevertheless, some further adjustment is still required, in the framework of the orderly restructuring of the banking sector, and this is highly likely to generate an intensive process of financial consolidation.",2010,2010-01-01,1,Financial Institutions and Markets,,Economic policy; Business; Systemic risk; Empirical evidence; Asset (economics); Consolidation (business); Financial crisis; Prompt Corrective Action; Restructuring; Financial regulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230117365_5,https://ideas.repec.org/h/pal/palchp/978-0-230-11736-5_5.html https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230117365_5 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230117365_5,lens,004-308-171-597-689

The goal of our study is to imagine the future of finance and to identify challenges faced by policymakers in fighting systemic risk. It builds upon a tradition within the CPB to develop scenarios for policy analysis. We develop four scenarios for the future of finance. Our scenarios differ in two dimensions. First, to what extent soft information lies at the core of banks’ business. Second, to what extent scope economies exist between different banking activities.By combining these two dimensions, we obtain four scenarios: Isolated Islands, Big Banks, Competing Conglomerates, and Flat Finance. Market structure, market failures, and government failures vary between scenarios.These differences then translate into differences in the complexity of balance sheets, the ability to coordinate policy internationally, the information gap faced by regulators, the size of banks’ balance sheets, the tradability of banks’ assets, the level of interconnectedness, the potential for market discipline, and the threat of regulatory capture. As a result, each scenario calls for a different set of policies to combat systemic risk.",2010,2010-09-01,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Futures contract; Business; Systemic risk; Market structure; Market failure; Balance sheet; Tradability; Market discipline; Interconnectedness,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cpb:docmnt:211,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cpb:docmnt:211,lens,008-819-552-447-81X
"Borgy, V.; Clerc, L.; Renne, J.",House price boom bust cycles: identification issues and macro-prudential implications,"Over the recent months, several initiatives have taken place to develop macro-prudential regulation in order to prevent systemic risk and the build-up of financial imbalances. These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability of a set of indicators to robustly explain costly house price booms. According to ourreal long term interest rates, total investment, real credit and real stock prices tend to increase the probability of a costly house price boom.",2010,2010-09-01,1,Housing Markets in Europe,,Logit; Boom; Systemic risk; Economics; Interest rate; International economics; Discrete choice; Financial crisis; Bust; Monetary economics; Stock (geology),http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_16,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_16 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15340-2_16,lens,008-938-697-873-096
"Duffie, D.",How big banks fail and what to do about it,"Dealer banks--that is, large banks that deal in securities and derivatives, such as J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs--are of a size and complexity that sharply distinguish them from typical commercial banks. When they fail, as we saw in the global financial crisis, they pose significant risks to our financial system and the world economy. How Big Banks Fail and What to Do about It examines how these banks collapse and how we can prevent the need to bail them out.In sharp, clinical detail, Darrell Duffie walks readers step-by-step through the mechanics of large-bank failures. He identifies where the cracks first appear when a dealer bank is weakened by severe trading losses, and demonstrates how the bank's relationships with its customers and business partners abruptly change when its solvency is threatened. As others seek to reduce their exposure to the dealer bank, the bank is forced to signal its strength by using up its slim stock of remaining liquid capital. Duffie shows how the key mechanisms in a dealer bank's collapse--such as Lehman Brothers' failure in 2008--derive from special institutional frameworks and regulations that influence the flight of short-term secured creditors, hedge-fund clients, derivatives counterparties, and most devastatingly, the loss of clearing and settlement services.How Big Banks Fail and What to Do about It reveals why today's regulatory and institutional frameworks for mitigating large-bank failures don't address the special risks to our financial system that are posed by dealer banks, and outlines the improvements in regulations and market institutions that are needed to address these systemic risks.",2010,2010-10-18,87,,,Clearing; Business; Systemic risk; Creditor; Actuarial science; World economy; Solvency; Financial crisis; Stock (geology); Financial system,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24524403M/How_big_banks_fail,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24524403M/How_big_banks_fail https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/how-big-banks-fail-and-what-to-do-about-it_darrell-duffie/10929678/ http://bibliotheque.revue-banque.fr/book/45008019 https://www.amazon.com/How-Banks-Fail-What-about-ebook/dp/B004KZQKEQ https://princetonup.degruyter.com/view/title/507172 https://muse.jhu.edu/book/30359 http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BB03840177 https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/507172?tab_body=toc https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:pup:pbooks:9371 http://www.gbv.de/dms/zbw/630476357.pdf http://web.stanford.edu/~duffie/DuffieDealersMarch10.pdf http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1188563,lens,001-018-189-862-36X
"Bartlett, R.P.",Inefficiencies in the information thicket: A case study of derivative disclosures during the financial crisis,"Conventional wisdom concerning the causes of the Financial Crisis posits that insufficient disclosure concerning firms’ exposure to complex credit derivatives played a key role in creating the uncertainty that plagued the financial sector in the fall of 2008. To help avert future financial crises, regulatory proposals aimed at containing systemic risk have accordingly focused on enhanced derivative disclosures as a critical reform measure. A central challenge facing these proposals, however, has been understanding whether enhanced derivative disclosures can have any meaningful effect given the complexity of credit derivative transactions.This Article provides an empirical examination of the effect of enhanced derivative disclosures by examining the disclosure experience of the monoline insurance industry in 2008. Like AIG Financial Products, monoline insurance companies wrote billions of dollars of credit default swaps on multi-sector CDOs tied to residential home mortgages, but unlike AIG, their unique status as financial guarantee companies subjected them to considerable disclosure obligations concerning their individual credit derivative exposures. As a result, the experience of the monoline industry during the Financial Crisis provides an ideal setting with which to test the efficacy of reforms aimed at promoting more elaborate derivative disclosures.Overall, the of this study indicate that investors in monoline insurers showed little evidence of using a firm’s derivative disclosures to efficiently resolve uncertainty about a monoline’s exposure to credit risk. In particular, analysis of the abnormal returns to Ambac Financial (one of the largest monoline insurers) surrounding a series of significant, multi-notch rating downgrades of its insured CDOs reveals no significant stock price reactions until Ambac itself announced the effect of these downgrades in its quarterly earnings announcements. Similar analyses of Ambac’s short-selling data and changes in the cost of insuring Ambac debt securities against default also confirm the absence of a market reaction following these downgrade announcements. Following a qualitative examination of how investors process derivative disclosures, the Article concludes that to the extent the complexity of CDOs impeded informational efficiency, it was most likely due to the generally low salience of individual CDOs as well as the logistic (although not necessarily analytic) challenge of processing a CDO’s disclosures. Reform efforts aimed at enhancing derivative disclosures should accordingly focus on mechanisms to promote the rapid collection and compilation of disclosed information as well as the psychological processes by which information obtains salience.",2010,2010-01-01,6,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Derivative (finance); Financial services; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Economics; Credit risk; Financial crisis; Credit default swap; Credit derivative; Financial system; Collateralized debt obligation,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1585953,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1585953 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1585953 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1585953_code363066.pdf?abstractid=1585953&mirid=1 https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1585953 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1585953_code363066.pdf?abstractid=1585953&rulid=144099&mirid=3,lens,008-742-946-046-40X

"Papanikolaou, N.I.; Wolff, C.C.P.",Leverage and risk in US commercial banking in the light of the current financial crisis,"In this paper we study the relationship between leverage and risk in US commercial banking market. We employ a representative panel data set of systemically important banks that extends from 2002 to 2009 thus covering both the years before the outbreak of the current financial crisis and those that followed. Several alternative variables are used to capture both on- and off-balance-sheet leverage as well as short-term leverage. Regarding risk, it is proxied by two measures: the systemic risk potential and banks’ overall risk. Our findings indicate reliably that both on- and off-balance-sheet leverage contributes to (systemic) risk, which implies that large banks do not maintain a level of leverage that could allow for equity capital to act fully as a buffer, absorbing losses and enabling the business to continue in case of financial distress. In a similar vein, a direct link between short-term leverage and risk is reported, showing that leverage is one of the main factors responsible for the serious bank liquidity shortages that were revealed in the current crisis. We also find that those banks that concentrate on traditional banking activities typically carry less risk exposure than those that are involved with new financial instruments. The latter finding could play a role in the current discussion about a possible revival of the Glass-Steagall Act. Overall, our provide a better understanding of the main causes of the present crisis and contribute to the discussion on the reinforcement of the existing regulatory framework.",2010,2010-01-01,4,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Business; Systemic risk; Retail banking; Actuarial science; Market liquidity; Financial instrument; Financial crisis; Commercial banking; Panel data; Financial system; Leverage (finance),http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1570505,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Wolff4/publication/228252699_Leverage_and_Risk_in_US_Commercial_Banking_in_the_Light_of_the_Current_Financial_Crisis/links/00b4951726318a62ac000000.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1570505 http://www.bcl.lu/fr/publications/bulletins_bcl/Revue_de_stabilite_2010/Seminaire/session_1_a.pdf https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/22960 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/DP10890.pdf?abstractid=2676596&mirid=1 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/47590/ http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/29776/ https://www.bcl.lu/fr/publications/bulletins_bcl/Revue_de_stabilite_2010/Seminaire/session_1_-_pres.pdf http://srodev.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/47590/ https://core.ac.uk/display/31219802,lens,007-029-563-290-552

"Delimatsis, P.",Promoting renewable energy through adaptive prudential regulation in financial services,"Promotion of renewable energy has become one important priority in the political agenda worldwide. However, financing of renewable energy projects, especially the small-scale ones, is not always streamlined and banks may not always be willing to invest in such projects. This fact is accentuated by the current credit crunch. To overcome this challenge foster competition and improve liquidity and diversification of financing opportunities in renewables markets, this paper argues for the adoption of less stringent prudential regulations for those financial service suppliers intending to supply the entire gamut of financial services exclusively in the area of renewable energy. The paper’s underlying syllogism is that the creation of differentiated categories of renewable energy financial service suppliers (REFS) which will have to comply with varying prudential requirements based on such criteria as the type of business activities pursued the total output of the company the value of service transactions or the systemic risk potential will be beneficial for the area of renewable energy and ultimately the combat against global warming.",2010,2010-01-01,0,,,Finance; Financial services; Business; Systemic risk; Credit crunch; Diversification (marketing strategy); Market liquidity; Renewable energy; Service (business); Political agenda,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atilburguniversity.edu%3Apublications%2Ff2f0e514-493c-4e62-b162-7a7d3ae8725d,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atilburguniversity.edu%3Apublications%2Ff2f0e514-493c-4e62-b162-7a7d3ae8725d,lens,001-661-014-872-497
"Kodres, L.E.; Narain, A.",Redesigning the contours of the future financial system,"This paper explores the private- and public-sector responses to the crisis and some of the probable outcomes. Aside from improved supervision of individual institutions, greater emphasis needs to be put on financial regulations that reflect the systemic nature of financial risks and the role that macroeconomic policies play. Global consistency of regulation and financial sector taxation will be essential to mitigate systemic risks, avoid unintended distortions, and help ensure a level playing field. This note suggests the key aspects of the future contours will likely be: Banks are expected to return to their more traditional function as stricter regulation will limit the risks and activities they can undertake. The nonbanking sector will likely have a greater competitive advantage both in supplying credit and providing investors with nonbank services and will thus grow. The perimeter of regulation will need to expand to take into account risks in the nonbank sector. Market infrastructure will be reinforced to protect investors and will need to provide simplicity and transparency to make risks clearer and the financial system safer. The global financial system is likely to be smaller and less levered than in the recent past, and could well be less innovative and dynamic, at least for a while.",2010,2010-08-16,12,Research Papers in Economics,,Business; Systemic risk; Financial instrument; Financial market; Transparency (market); Global financial system; Level playing field; Financial regulation; Financial system; Financial risk,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:imf:imfspn:2010/10,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:imf:imfspn:2010/10,lens,008-513-103-032-879
"Wilmarth, A.E.",Reforming financial regulation to address the too-big-to-fail problem,"The ongoing financial crisis has revealed fundamental weaknesses in the regulatory systems of the United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations. In particular, publicly-funded bailouts of major banks have confirmed that too big to fail (TBTF) subsidies distort economic incentives and encourage excessive risk-taking by large, complex financial institutions (LCFIs). Accordingly, the primary goals of regulatory reform must be (i) to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, TBTF subsidies and (ii) to force LCFIs to internalize the risks and costs of their activities.After surveying the causes and consequences of the financial crisis, this article proposes five regulatory reforms that are designed to shrink TBTF subsidies in the U.S. First, existing size caps on large banks should be strengthened. Second, LCFIs whose failure would pose a systemic threat to the stability of the financial system should be publicly designated as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). A special resolution regime administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation should be created to handle failures of SIFIs. This resolution regime should follow the essential principles of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, including (i) wiping out the investments of shareholders, (ii) dismissing senior executives and directors, and (iii) requiring creditors to accept haircuts in the form of less-than-full payment of their claims or conversion of their claims into equity interests in a successor institution. Third, SIFIs should be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and to enhanced capital requirements. Fourth, SIFIs should be required to pay insurance premiums to establish a systemic risk insurance fund (SRIF) to cover the future costs of resolving failed SIFIs. The SRIF should be kept strictly separate from the existing Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). To prevent the DIF from being used to support future bailouts of TBTF institutions, Congress should prohibit the DIF from making any payments to uninsured creditors of banking organizations. Fifth, to ensure that SIFIs cannot use the federal safety net to subsidize speculative activities in the capital markets, a two-tiered system of banking regulation and deposit insurance should be established. The first tier of traditional banking organizations could provide services that are closely related to banking. However, those entities would not be allowed to engage, or affiliate with firms engaged, in securities underwriting or dealing, insurance underwriting or derivatives dealing. First-tier banks would operate under their current supervisory arrangements, including their existing deposit insurance.In contrast, the second tier of nontraditional banking organizations would be allowed to engage in capital markets activities, but they would be required to conduct those activities solely in nonbank holding company subsidiaries. Second-tier banking organizations would also be required to operate their banking subsidiaries as narrow banks. Narrow banks could not accept uninsured deposits and could not make any loans or other transfers of funds to their affiliates(except for lawful dividends paid to their parent holding companies). In addition, narrow banks could not purchase or sell derivatives except for bona fide hedging purposes.The primaryof the narrow bank requirement, in conjunction with the other four proposed reforms, would be (i) to prevent financial conglomerates from using FDIC-insured deposits as a source of low-cost funding for speculative activities in the capital markets, and (ii) to compel financial conglomerates to internalize the potential risks and costs of their activities. If financial conglomerates cannot produce attractive returns without exploiting public subsidies, they will face significant pressure from investors to break up voluntarily, in the same way that investors forced many industrial conglomerates to break up after 1980.",2010,2010-03-15,4,Social Science Research Network,,Capital market; Systemic risk; Economics; Underwriting; Deposit insurance; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Capital requirement; Financial regulation; Financial system,https://ssrn.com/abstract=1645921,https://ssrn.com/abstract=1645921 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1645921 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1692960_code292185.pdf?abstractid=1645921&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1692960_code292185.pdf?abstractid=1645921&mirid=1&type=2,lens,005-192-896-077-28X

The article suggests a new normative approach to self-regulation in the financial services sector embedded self-regulation which focuses explicitly on prevention of systemic failure and is firmly embedded in the broader public interests and policy goals.

"Fox, R.; Rawcliffe, G.; Renwick, D.",Special report macro-prudential risk monitor,"Summary This latest semi annual report updates the systemic risk indicators Fitch Ratings has published since 2005. The change of title to Macro Prudential Risk Monitor from Bank Systemic Risk Report more accurately reflects the report’sto identify the build up of potential stress in banking systems due to a specific set of circumstances: rapid credit growth associated with bubbles in housing or equity markets or appreciated real exchange rates, the latter sometimes associated with asset market bubbles. The focus of the report is therefore on only one potential source of systemic stress in banking systems. Fitch continues to review its methodology in light of the evidence gained from the banking crises of the past few years. This report presents the of research which has been used to recalibrate the thresholds used to judge when stresses in key variables have reached critical levels. In addition, it reports the of a review comparing the success rates of the approach looking at deviations from trend of the key variables and a simpler one using percentage changes in those variables. The latter approach has, up to now, only been applied to Emerging Europe (EE), where it was dictated by the relatively short length of time series available and the difficulty of discerning clear trends, largely due to the economic transition process underway in those countries. The conclusion is that this approach in fact works best for most emerging markets (EMs), probably due to the general problem of establishing definitive trends in countries undergoing important structural changes. By contrast, the model looking at deviations from trend continues to work much better for developed countries (DCs). The success rate of the region specific models, measured by crises predicted, is over 70% for DCs and 50% for EMs. But in interpreting the of the resulting Macro Prudential Indicator (MPI) scores, it is important to remember that this type of early warning analysis inevitably gives false alarms. They can be minimised but not eliminated by careful calibration while maintaining an acceptable success rate. In the final models adopted, the ratio of correct signals to false alarms is still a relatively high 50%. The resulting MPI scores can therefore only be a starting point for Fitch’s in depth country and banking system analysis. The period of analysis in this report is moved forward a year to 2007 2009.

"Terna, P.","Systemic risk in artificial worlds, using a new tool in the ABM perspective","Following Ostrom (1988), and to some extent, Gilbert and Terna (2000), in social science, we traditionally build models as simplified representations of reality in two ways: (i) verbal argumentation and (ii) mathematical equations, typically with statistics and econometrics. The first way (i) is absolutely flexible and adaptable, as in the case of a historical book reporting an analysis of past events, but mere descriptions and discussion, by their nature, preclude tests and verifications of hypotheses. In contrast, the second way (ii) allows for computations and verifications, but suffers from severe limitations in flexibility and adaptation, especially with respect to how agents are expected to operate in the model and when accounting for their heterogeneity and interactions. There is a third way to build models, (iii) computer simulation, mainly if agent-based. Computer simulation can combine the extreme flexibility of a computer code where we can create agents who act, make choices, and react to the choices of other agents and to modification of their environment and its intrinsic computability. This allows us to use the descriptive capabilities of verbal argumentation and the ability to calculate the effects of different situations and hypotheses together. From this perspective, the computer program is a form of mathematics. In addition, we can generate time series from our models and analyze them employing statistics and econometrics. However, reality is intrinsically agent-based, not equation-based (for a short, but illuminating discussion of this consideration, see Weinberg (2002) in his review of Wolfram’s book, A New Kind of Science). At first glance, this is a strong criticism. Why reproduce social structures in an agent-based way, following (iii), when science applies (ii) to describe, explain, and forecast reality, which is, per se, too complicated to be understood The first reply is that we can, with agent-based models and simulation, produce artifacts of actual systems and play with them, i.e., showing consequences of perfectly known ex-ante hypotheses and agent behavioral designs and interactions then we can",2010,2010-01-01,1,,,Human–computer interaction; Computability; Perspective (graphical); Operations management; Computer program; Flexibility (engineering); Mathematics; Source code; Contrast (statistics); Argumentation theory; Adaptation (computer science),https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/88419,https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/88419 https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/3966/1/Terna%20Atti%20Economia%20e%20Incertezza.pdf https://www.openstarts.units.it/handle/10077/3966,lens,007-756-896-753-595
"Overmyer, M.I.",The 'Foreign private adviser' exemption: A potential gap in the new systemic risk regulatory architecture,"Since the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, policymakers have generally agreed that hedge funds can add to systemic risk in the U.S. economy. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (WSRCPA) aims in part to address this risk by granting regulators the authority to impose prudential requirements on hedge funds. Crucial to the effectiveness of this authority will be the ability of regulators to timely and accurately identify which funds should be subject to such requirements. The WSRCPA requires U.S. hedge fund managers to self-identify the funds they manage by registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In contrast, foreign hedge fund managers whose funds do not include a threshold number of U.S. investors or amount of capital managed on behalf of U.S. investors are not required to register. As a result, to fulfill their statutory responsibility to protect the U.S. economy from systemic risks, regulators will themselves need to identify which foreign funds could pose a risk to the U.S. economy. The scope and quality of public information and the potential unreliability of international cooperation make it unlikely that U.S. regulators can accurately, promptly, and efficiently identify such funds. Exempting foreign hedge fund managers from the registration requirement therefore frustrates the ability of U.S. regulators to manage systemic risk. To fill this gap, managers of foreign hedge funds that meet thresholds for holdings of U.S. assets and obligations to U.S. lenders should be made to register with the SEC. Although the opportunity to narrow the WSRCPA's ""foreign private adviser"" exemption has passed, an alternative vehicle for bringing about self-identification exists in the SEC's proposed Large Trader Reporting System rule.",2010,2010-11-01,1,Social Science Research Network,,Accounting; Business; Systemic risk; Open-end fund; Alternative beta; Hedge fund; Institutional investor; Fund of funds; Global assets under management; Closed-end fund,http://www.columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/110-8_Overmeyer.pdf,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1720668_code1586173.pdf?abstractid=1720668&mirid=1&type=2 http://www.columbialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/110-8_Overmeyer.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1720668,lens,001-995-515-333-088
"Caravelis, G.",The EU financial supervision in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis: an appraisal,"We appraise the new EU supervisory architecture presented by the Commission in a package of five 'draft legislative acts'. Two would establish a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to undertake macro-prudential issues. Three would establish the system of European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs): Banking, Securities and Insurance..The theoretical case for this package of 'draft legislative acts' has been made by the High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU. Thepackagehas been examined by the ECOFIN ofDecember 2009, which agreed on a 'general approach' it has introduced changes to the Commission's three draft legislative acts concerning the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). We examine the theoretical approach underlying the draft legislative acts, which is based on the State theory of money. We find it incomplete in the case of the ESRB because the mission of ECB in 'mitigating system risks within the financial system' cannot be attained without real powers and tools it is in essence a Macro-economic phenomenon..We also arrive at another conclusion relating to the three proposals on the ESAs. The theoretical underpinning of the three is based on the premise of 'regulating for the sake of regulation'. Today's evolution of the EU cannot allow Authorities over-passing the Treaty competence. Nor could the ESAs attain their of 'setting the common rules for supervising national entities'. Thus the conception of the EU system of financial supervision is deficient, in need of repair..We propose an alternative approach to the new EU supervisory architecture consisting of three elements. First, we restate the case for the Central Banks in order to assume responsibility for the 'last resort of managing risk', and endowed with real power. Second, the role of the national central banks (NCBs) in 'micro-supervision' is substantial enhanced. Third, a structure for the budgetary burden is proposed by the establishment of the 'European Fund for Financial Stability' (EFFS)..",2010,2010-01-29,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Competence (human resources); Finance; Natural monopoly; Accounting; Business; Systemic risk; Commission; Premise; Treaty; Financial transaction tax; Legislature,https://ideas.repec.org/p/rsc/rsceui/2010-11.html,https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/13535 https://ideas.repec.org/p/rsc/rsceui/2010-11.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:rsc:rsceui:2010/11,lens,002-800-780-786-903
"Iwata, K.",The EU financial system under the global financial crisis,"The severe recession in the EU economy after the September 2008 Lehman shock was caused by vulnerability in the EU financial systems. Why did the problems in the US mortgage market explode throughout Europe Were there any deficiencies in the EU financial regulatory and supervisory system These problems should be solved within the framework of the EU integration studies.To tackle these problems, sectionsand II of this paper consider these issues by focusing on problems the EU financial institutions faced prior to the financial crisis. The present regime of EU financial institutions was established through (1) domestic consolidation during the 1992 Internal Market period, (2) cross-border consolidation during the 1999 Monetary Integration period and (3) the one way entry into emerging markets through EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007. This paper focuses on how the financial institutions reacted to the new environment of historically low profitability in the first half of the 2000s, and divides the banks into two groups according to their business strategy for higher profitability: (1) Some banks attached greater importance to the so called trading book business, which is associated with the Shadow Banking System in the US. (2) Other banking groups expanded their branch network, i.e. banking bookthroughout the new EU member states.Sections III and IV describe the global financial crisis by distinguishing between its two phases. PhaseIwas the trading book crisis period when risks that had accumulated during the worldwide excess liquidity environment gradually materialized after 2006 and finally exploded in September 2008. In the current post-Lehman shock Phase II, the EU economy faces a traditional banking book crisis due to the accumulation of non-performing loans.The issues concerning the EU financial regulation and supervision are reviewed in section V. The present crisis can be described as the first truly pan-European financial crisis since the decentralized system of EU financial regulation and supervision was established in 1992. In the face of such a challenging environment, there has been significant progress in EU financial regulation laws. Also concerning financial supervision, both the ESFS (European System of Financial Supervisors) and the ESRB (European Systemic Risk Board) have been established. The global financial crisis has thus urged the EU to establish a more integrated financial regulatory and supervisory system.",2010,2010-01-01,1,Eu Studies in Japan,,Systemic risk; Economics; Market liquidity; Recession; Indirect finance; Consolidation (business); Financial crisis; Shadow banking system; Financial regulation; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.5135/eusj.2010.39,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/eusj/2010/30/2010_30_39/_article https://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/eusj/2010.39?from=CrossRef https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/eusj/2010/30/2010_30_39/_pdf,lens,000-083-037-104-521

However, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can control C5aR activation by generating C5a through its own C5 convertase-like enzymatic activity. In this paper, we show that P. gingivalis uses this mechanism to proactively and selectively inhibit TLR2-induced IL-12p70, whereas the same pathogen-instigated C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk upregulates other inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). In vivo, the ability of P. gingivalis to manipulate TLR2 activation via the C5a-C5aR axis allowed it to escape IL-12p70-dependent immune clearance and to cause inflammatory bone loss in a murine model of experimental periodontitis. In the latter regard, C5aR-deficient or TLR2-deficient mice were both resistant to periodontal bone loss, in stark contrast with wild-type control mice, which is consistent with the interdependent interactions of C5aR and TLR2 in P. gingivalis immune evasion and induction of bone-resorptive cytokines. In conclusion, P. gingivalis targets C5aR to promote its adaptive fitness and cause periodontal disease. Given the current availability of safe and effective C5aR antagonists, pharmacological blockade of C5aR could act therapeutically in human periodontitis and reduce associated systemic risks.",2010,2010-12-13,142,"Journal of Immunology (baltimore, Md. : 1950)","alveolar bone loss/immunology; animals; disease models, animal; immune evasion/genetics; inflammation mediators/metabolism; interleukin-10/physiology; interleukin-12/antagonists & inhibitors; mice; mice, inbred balb c; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; myeloid differentiation factor 88/physiology; periodontitis/immunology; porphyromonas gingivalis/growth & development; receptor cross-talk/immunology; receptor, anaphylatoxin c5a/deficiency; signal transduction/genetics; toll-like receptor 2/antagonists & inhibitors",Complement system; Interleukin 10; Immunology; C5a receptor; Periodontal pathogen; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Periodontitis; TLR2; Biology; Immune system,http://dx.doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1003252,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075594/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3075594 https://www.jimmunol.org/content/186/2/869.full https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21149611/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21149611 https://www.jimmunol.org/lookup/doi/10.4049/jimmunol.1003252,lens,002-563-603-463-437
"Jobst, A.",The credit crisis and operational riskimplications for practitioners and regulators,"The fallout from the financial crisis has illustrated that many sources of systemic risk were triggered or at least propagated by vulnerabilities in operational risk management (ORM), which has not kept pace with financial innovation, and an excessive focus of regulation on prudential requirements without recognition of substantial operational risk in market-based liquidity transformation.

Although increased systemic risk factors in the setting of insulin resistance contribute to this problem, it is likely exacerbated by direct effects of insulin resistance on the arterial wall cells that participate in atherosclerosis. A critical process in the progression of subclinical atherosclerotic lesions to clinically relevant lesions is necrotic breakdown of plaques. Plaque necrosis, which is particularly prominent in the lesions of diabetics, is caused by the combination of macrophage apoptosis and defective phagocytic clearance, or efferocytosis, of the apoptotic macrophages. One cause of macrophage apoptosis in advanced plaques is activation of a proapoptotic branch of the unfolded protein response, which is an endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.

"McIlroy, D.H.",The regulatory issues raised by credit default swaps,"This article considers the regulatory issues raised by the increased use of credit default swaps (CDSs). It argues that the current extensive over-the-counter trading of CDSs raises problems in terms of the opacity of risk, misaligned incentives in the event of default by reference entities, and concentrations of counterparty risk, each of which requires addressing. Among the proposals discussed are the standardisation of CDSs, the use of central counterparties, the of exchange trading of CDSs, the imposition of capital penalties on bespoke CDSs or mandatory collateralisation, limiting the extent to which CDSs can be used to hedge a position fully, the prohibition of naked CDS protection and the of large exposure counterparty limits. The article concludes that while standardisation and exchange trading of CDSs should be promoted, mandatory collateralisation is preferable to the use of capital penalties. Naked CDS protection buying should be prohibited unless measures can be put in place to ensure that it does not have adverse effects in the event of default by reference entities.

We choose to model directly the spot recovery, which allows to preserve time consistency, and compare this approach to the standard ones, defined in terms of recovery to maturity. Taking a specific form of the spot recovery function, we show that the model is flexible and tractable, and easy to calibrate to both individual credit spread curves and index tranche markets.

Twenty-four million (8%) of Americans have known diabetes, and 57 million have pre-diabetes4. By 2050 the number of Americans with diabetic retinopathy is projected to triple from 5.5 to 16 million, and those with vision threatening retinopathy from 1.2 to 3.4 million. The number of cataracts will increase by 235% and glaucoma among elderly Hispanics with diabetes will increase 12 fold5 The economic impact of diabetes-induced ocular disease is profound. Medicare expenditures for persons with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy are 63% greater than those without retinopathy, and 400% greater for those with proliferative retinopathy than those without retinopathy6. Persons with diabetes also have an increased risk of retinal vascular occlusions, neurotrophic keratitis, and cranial nerve palsies. Therefore, the obesity induced diabetes epidemic will create a financially unsustainable burden of diabetic ocular disease. Current means to screen populations at risk for diabetic retinopathy have succeeded in Europe, but have had minimal impact on the US where persons are more independent, health care delivery is more fractionated and population-based incentives for prevention are less. Hence, many patients still present to eye care providers with advanced eye disease. Scatter photocoagulation and vitrectomy are palliative and do not restore normal visual function. To date no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy exists for diabetic retinopathy, and the only proven medical treatments are intensive diabetes therapy and control of hypertension7. Hence, we still lack proven adjunctive therapies to slow the rate of progression of nonproliferative retinopathy beyond control of diabetes and hypertension, and photocoagulation is only effective when patients develop macular edema or proliferative retinopathy. Medical therapies such as intravitreal steroids or vascular endothelial cell growth inhibitors show modest transient benefits that are no more effective than laser photocoagulation8, 9. Diabetic retinopathy has been understood as a microvascular disease of the eye, but recent studies have established that diabetes impacts the entire neurosensory retina, including ganglion cells, Muller cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, endothelial cells and pericytes10. Contrast sensitivity, dark adaptation, visual fields, and electroretinographic tests reveal that visual function is impaired at or before the onset of microaneurysms in many patients with diabetes11. Thus, diabetic retinopathy is a sensory neuropathy involving the retinal parenchyma similar to peripheral neuropathy. Understanding how diabetes impacts the neural retina may improve means to diagnose diabetic retinopathy before symptomatic vision loss and may reduce the personal and economic costs. The common diseases managed by ophthalmologists, cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and strabismus are primarily ocular disorders, and we treat diabetic ocular complications surgically with cataract extraction, photocoagulation, and vitrectomy. By contrast, the primary means to modify the course of diabetic eye diseases lie in the hands of non-ophthalmic physicians. Surgically oriented approaches to late stage eye disease fail to adequately address the current public health problem, so future efforts must focus on prevention and early intervention, and the role of ophthalmologists must evolve. First, we must emphasize the systemic factors that affect the development and progression of diabetic eye disease, notably poor metabolic and blood pressure control, and understand the medical treatment strategies. Second, ophthalmologists and other physicians must improve two-way communications. For example, ophthalmic evaluation of diabetic retinopathy currently involves primarily features such as the severity of retinopathy and presence of macular edema or proliferative retinopathy. However, patients with any degree of retinopathy and higher HbA1c and blood pressure are more likely to lose vision than those with better control, so ophthalmologists should know the data on the systemic health of their patients to counsel and treat them more effectively. Likewise, physicians should know the ophthalmic status of their patients so they can motivate them towards appropriate self-care measures. Ophthalmologists can also measure blood pressure, or observe ankle swelling from cardiac or renal failure and relay these findings to their patients' physicians. Third, ophthalmologists should realize that seemingly small differences in systemic risk factors lead to large differences in ocular complications. Each 1% reduction in HbA1c reduces the risk of retinopathy development or progression by 40%,12 and the effects are long-lasting9. A 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures reduces the risk of developing retinopathy by20%13 and the risk of proliferative retinopathy by 14%14. Encouragingly, nonproliferative retinopathy can improve in 18 36% of patients,13, 14 so diabetic retinopathy does not invariably progress to vision loss. These findings show clearly that diabetic retinopathy can be positively influenced by appropriate medical care. In addition, treatment of associated comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, anemia, and hyperlipidemia may also improve visual outcome15. Recent work has demonstrated the benefits of the Chronic Care Model in which patient-centered care of chronic diseases such as diabetes is enhanced by teams of physicians, nurses, and allied health personnel16. Diabetes educators can assist overtaxed physicians by monitoring the implementation of screening and care guidelines, and enhance long-term management17. Patient care visits continue to shorten and the list of guidelines that must be implemented continues expands, so the only tenable solution involves expanding the definition of the health care team in a more coordinated fashion. For example, ophthalmologic practices might consider an approach to distribute a know your numbers brochure i.e. know your HBA1c, LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, so the ophthalmologist can reinforce the importance of risk factors with their patients. Better coordination of care between specialists and primary care teams will enable goals to be reinforced for patients with diabetes. Ophthalmologists have a unique opportunity to influence patient behavior since vision loss is one of the most feared complications of diabetes. Helping patients make the connection between their eye disease and the ABCs of diabetes (A1C, Blood pressure, and Cholesterol) can motivate them to improve their health. Data sharing by all team members and patients through a web-based registry can facilitate this process for all team members, including ophthalmologists18. The importance of this paradigm shifting approach is emphasized by the fact that only 7.3% of diabetic patients meet therapeutic goals for the three most important categories, HbA1c, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol,19 but nurse case managers and coordinated teams increase this rate significantly20. We suggest how ophthalmologists and medical teams can help patients with their diabetes and obesity. However, personal responsibility and education about appropriate food intake, weight loss and exercise are also essential, and third-party payers must reward preventive efforts. Now is the time for new strategies to address diabetes related eye disease, and for ophthalmologists to actively participate in these efforts. This shift will require modifications to medical student and ophthalmology resident training and organization of practices with greater emphasis on medical and public health strategies, rather than new lasers or vitrectomy techniques. Complications begin at the time of diabetes diagnosis, and most patients with diabetes do not have retinopathy, so the greatest therapeutic opportunity is to prevent retinopathy (Dr. Lloyd M. Aiello, personal communication). Diabetic retinopathy is preventable and there is greater opportunity to prevent diabetes-related vision loss than glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration. Ophthalmologists are front line warriors in the fight against diabetes and obesity related vision loss and can win the war using new tactics and weapons for the 21st century.",2009,2009-03-09,14,"Archives of Ophthalmology (chicago, Ill. : 1960)","cataract/etiology; diabetes complications; diabetic retinopathy/etiology; glaucoma/etiology; humans; obesity/complications; ophthalmology/trends; patient care team/statistics & numerical data; practice patterns, physicians'",Ophthalmology; Macular degeneration; Chronic care; Retinopathy; Diabetic retinopathy; Population; Diabetes Therapy; Diabetic Eye Disease; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.13,https://core.ac.uk/display/37932487 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2922749 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/422566 https://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.13 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19273798,lens,008-019-777-557-838
"Abad, P.; Chuliá, H.; Gómez-Puig, M.",EMU and european government bond market integration,"The main of this paper is to study whether the of the euro had an impact on the degree of integration of European Government bond markets. We adopt the CAPM-based model of Bekaert and Harvey (1995) to compare, from the beginning of Monetary Union until June 2008, the differences in the relative importance of two sources of systemic risk (world and Eurozone risk) on Government bond returns, in the two groups of countries (EMU and non-EMU) in EU-15. Our empirical evidence suggests that the impact of the of the euro on the degree of integration of European Government bond markets was important. The markets of the countries that share a monetary policy are less vulnerable to the influence of world risk factors, and more vulnerable to EMU risk factors. However, euro markets are only partially integrated, since they are still segmented and present differences in market liquidity or default risk. For their part, the countries that decided to stay out of the Monetary Union present a higher vulnerability to external risk factors.

"Paderni, S.; Terzi, S.; Amendola, L.",Major bone defect treatment with an osteoconductive bone substitute,"A bone defect can be provoked by several pathological conditions (e.g. bone tumours, infections, major trauma with bone stock loss) or by surgical procedures, required for the appropriate treatment. Surgical techniques currently used for treating bone defects may count on different alternatives, including autologous vascularized bone grafts, homologous bone graft provided by musculoskeletal tissue bank, heterologous bone graft (xenograft), or prostheses, each one of them dealing with both specific advantages and complications and drawbacks. The main concerns related to these techniques respectively are: donor site morbidity and limited available amount possible immune response and viral transmission possible animal-derived pathogen transmission and risk of immunogenic rejection high invasiveness and surgery-related systemic risks, long post-operative. physical recovery and prostheses revision need. Nowadays, an ideal alternative is the use of osteoconductive synthetic bone substitutes. Many synthetic substitutes are available, used either alone or in combination with other bone graft. Synthetic bone graft materials available as alternatives to autogeneous bone include calcium sulphates, special glass ceramics (bioactive glasses) and calcium phosphates (calcium hydroxyapatite, HA tricalcium phosphate, TCP and biphasic calcium phosphate, BCP). These materials differ in composition and physical properties fro each other and from bone (De Groot in Bioceramics of calcium phosphate, pp 100-114, 1983 Hench inAm Ceram Soc 74:1487-1510, 1994 Jarcho in Clin Orthop 157:259-278, 1981 Daculsi et al. in Int Rev Cytol 172:129-191, 1996). Both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric HA-based substitutes represent the current first choice in orthopedic surgery, in that they provide an osteoconductive scaffold to which chemotactic, circulating proteins and cells (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, osteoinductive growth factors) can migrate and adhere, and within which progenitor cells can differentiate into functioning osteoblasts (Szpalski and Gunzburg in Orthopedics 25S:601-609, 2002). Indeed, HA may be extemporarily combined either with whole autologous bone marrow or PRP (platelet rich plasma) gel inside surgical theatre in order to favour and accelerate bone regeneration. A case of bifocal ulnar bone defect treated with stoichiometric HA-based bone substitute combined with PRP is reported in here, with a 12-month-radiographic follow-up.",2009,2009-06-16,44,La Chirurgia Degli Organi Di Movimento,"accidents, occupational; anti-bacterial agents/administration & dosage; bone substitutes; bone transplantation; ceramics; debridement; drug implants; durapatite/administration & dosage; external fixators; fracture fixation/instrumentation; fractures, open/surgery; fractures, ununited/surgery; humans; internal fixators; intraoperative complications/etiology; male; middle aged; osseointegration; platelet-rich plasma; surgical flaps; tissue scaffolds; ulna fractures/etiology; wound infection/drug therapy",Osseointegration; Surgery; Mesenchymal stem cell; Progenitor cell; Platelet-rich plasma; Bone regeneration; Calcium; Orthopedic surgery; Medicine; Scaffold,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12306-009-0028-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19711008/ https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/major-bone-defect-treatment-with-an-osteoconductive-bone-substitu https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12306-009-0028-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19711008,lens,008-892-578-083-12X

It begins with a review of those aspects of the subprime crisis that required the large, observed government interventions, namely the feared bankruptcy of individual banks, insurers, and government sponsored enterprises with the potential to create a meltdown of the entire financial system. The paper then develops legislative responses that would make future systemic failures and bailouts of this magnitude highly unlikely. The paper's key analytic device is to distinguish two financial firm activities: (1) risky investment activities (hedge fund"" division) capable of causing firm bankruptcy, and (2) market-making and related activities (infrastructure"" division), the failure of which would have systemic implications. The goal of the proposed regulatory change is to ensure that the infrastructure division is bankruptcy remote and can operate on a stand-alone basis if necessary even when losses from the hedge fund division threaten the holding company's solvency.",2009,2009-03-24,8,the B.e.

"Kregel, J.",Observations on the problem of 'Too big to fail save resolve',"Past experience suggests that multifunctional banking is the leading source of financial crisis, while large bank size contributes to contagion and systemic risk. This indicates that resolving large banks will not solve the problems associated with multifunctional banking--a conclusion reached after every financial crisis, and one that should apply to the present crisis as well. Senior Scholar Jan Kregel observes that it is important to recognize that past solutions may not be appropriate for present conditions. The approach to the current financial crisis has been to resolve small- and medium-size banks through the FDIC, while banks considered ""too big to fail"" are given direct and indirect government support. Many of these large government-supported banks have been allowed to absorb smaller banks through FDIC resolution, creating even larger banks. As these institutions repay their direct government support, the problem of ""too big to fail"" is simply aggravated. Thus, the current thrust of government regulatory reform--increased capital and liquidity requirements, and further legislation--is unlikely to lessen the systemic risks these institutions pose.",2009,2009-12-01,5,Research Papers in Economics,,Systemic risk; Government; Actuarial science; Economics; Market liquidity; Financial crisis; Too big to fail; Financial system; Capital (economics),https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:lev:levypn:09-11,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:lev:levypn:09-11,lens,001-253-399-534-17X

"Partnoy, F.",Rethinking regulation of credit rating agencies: an institutional investor perspective,"This white paper was commissioned by the Council of Institutional Investors for the purpose of educating its members, policymakers, and the general public about important credit rating agency regulation proposals and their potential impact on investors. It offers an institutional investor perspective of the pros and cons of several proposals for redesigning credit rating agency regulation. It focuses on two areas of primary importanceoversight and accountabilityand offers specific recommendations in both areas. First, Congress should create a new Credit Rating Agency Oversight Board (CRAOB) with the power to regulate rating agency practices, including disclosure, conflicts of interest, and rating methodologies, as well as the ability to coordinate the reduction of reliance on ratings. Alternatively, Congress could enhance the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to grant it similar power to oversee the rating business. Second, Congress should eliminate the effective exemption of rating agencies from liability and make rating agencies more accountable by treating them the same as banks, accountants, and lawyers. As financial gatekeepers with little incentive to get it right, credit rating agencies pose a systemic risk. Creating a rating agency oversight board and strengthening the accountability of rating agencies is thus consistent with the broader push by U.S. policymakers for greater systemic risk oversight. Over the long term, other measures for assessing credit risk may become more acceptable and accessible to regulators and investors. Meanwhile, a more powerful overseer and broader accountability would help reposition credit rating agencies as true information intermediaries.",2009,2009-07-06,30,Social Science Research Network,,Finance; Structured finance; Accounting; Business; Bond credit rating; Credit risk; Credit rating; Institutional investor; Credit reference; Credit enhancement; Credit history,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1430608,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1430608 https://www.sandiego.edu/law/documents/centers/ccsl/credit_rating_agencies.pdf http://www.directorsforum.com/conference/materials/DF10_rethinking_regulation_white_paper_partnoy.pdf http://frankpartnoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CRAWhitePaper04-14-09.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1430608_code514132.pdf?abstractid=1430608&mirid=1&type=2,lens,006-036-207-627-656

Harmonization of the legal framework based on which the CSDs function, is one of the primary goals in the segment of business regulation at financial markets that the European Union pursues within its organizations. In this respect, in May 2009 The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) and The Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) issued an official document entitled Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems (Ref. CESR 09-446) containing recommendations which seek to improve competitiveness, safety and soundness of pan-European post trading arrangements, that should ultimately lead to greater confidence in securities markets and better investor protection by reducing systemic risk. Following completion of the comparative analysis of law regulations, business techniques, data protection and all the relevant parameters in work of the CSD, it was established that there is a very high degree of harmonization with the corresponding recommendations from the CESR 09-446 document, and thus, when it comes to this segment, we can conclude that the Republic of Serbia may very swiftly, and without major additional harmonization, become a part of the integral EU financial market.",2009,2009-01-01,0,,,Accounting; Clearing; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Settlement (finance); Harmonization; European union; Broker-dealer; Data Protection Act 1998,http://ebooks.ien.bg.ac.rs/119/,http://ebooks.ien.bg.ac.rs/119/,lens,008-124-468-947-466
"Allix, J.; Forest, D.; Vaigauskaite, D.",Single euro payments area (SEPA): self-regulation under competition scrutiny,"In the current situation retail banking remains an important sub-sector of the banking industry: the crisis has shown that solid and sound retail business allows banks to weather the present difficult circumstances much better. Payments are a particularly important business segment for banks. They ensure a recurrent revenue flow, which in the current market circumstances is vital. Payments are also vital for consumers and corporate clients, and investment in their efficiency and security can be used as a good customer-winning tool. Efficient and secure payments can facilitate an increase in trade and consumer spending, as well as help to bring down systemic risk in the financial markets. Non-cash payments are the main growth drivers for retail banking: according to a Capgemini report, the total number of non-cash payments in the EU grew by 6% per year in the period 2001-2006, (1) with a rate of 11% for cards alone. It is estimated that card usage will continue growing rapidly in the future, with the increasing number of merchants accepting payment cards together with the increasing availability of different card products. By 2013, in Italy, Sweden and Denmark for example, payments made by cards will constitute just over 60% of all non-cash transactions. In France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, UK and Poland this will amount to 40-50% and in Germany and Austria to approximately 20%.

"Bouveret, A.",The CDS market (in french),"One of the earliest signs of the financial crisis in summer 2007 was the plunge in the indicaaes compiled from credit default swaps (CDSs) on a basket of subprimebacked bonds. Recently, the worsening situation in the emerging countries has been perceptible in the steep rise of CDS spreads on their sovereign bonds. Credit default swaps protect investors against credit events on reference corporate or sovereign bonds. By guaranteeing against default risk, they also allow banks to reduce their equity requirements. In sum, CDSs are a hedging tool widely used by financial agents such as banks and hedge funds, which explains the CDS market's significant expansion in the past five years.As in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, counterparty risk is high, for there is no CDS clearing house to underwrite commitments through a system of margin calls and collateral. The failure of a major player such as Lehman Brothers or AIG can thus aggravate systemic risk, although several procedures established by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) have, until now, proven their efficiency for unwinding CDS contracts.The growth of CDSs helps lower banking systems' total equity requirements, as the reduction in the equity requirement for the CDS buyer (the protection buyer) exceeds the additional equity requirements incurred by the seller. CDS premiums (spreads) serve to estimate default probabilities expected by markets and are thus a leading indicator of fears over the solvency of corporate or government borrowers. However, the direct use of CDS spreads to determine expected default rates is subject to several biases.",2009,2009-02-06,0,Social Science Research Network,,Business; Systemic risk; Credit risk; Hedge fund; iTraxx; Credit default swap; Credit derivative; Default; Financial system; Credit default swap index,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1483490,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1483490 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=1483490,lens,001-511-721-525-263

"Recine, F.; Teixeira, P.G.",The new financial stability architecture in the EU,"After the of the euro in 1999, the debate on the financial stability architecture in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and the of the Lamfalussy process for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and supervisory cooperation. In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard cross-border financial stability. In this context, the financial crisis has proved to be a major challenge to the ongoing process of European financial integration. In particular, momentous events such as the freezing of interbank markets, the loss of confidence in financial institutions, runs on banks and difficulties affecting cross-border financial groups, questioned the ability of the EU financial stability architecture to contain threats to the integrated single financial market. In particular, the crisis has demonstrated the importance of coupling to micro-prudential supervision a macro dimension aimed at a broad and effective monitoring and assessment of the potential risks covering all components of the financial system. In Europe, following the de Larosiere Report, the European Commission has put forward proposals for establishing a European System of Financial Supervision and a European Systemic Risk Board, the latter body to be set up under the auspices of the ECB.

"Kapstein, E.B.",Architects of stability international cooperation among financial supervisors,"Speaking in May 1998, in the shadow of an Asian financial crisis that was spreading globally, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus announced that the leaders of the world want to embark on the design of a new (financial) architecture. Reflecting the position that industrial world governments would formally adopt at their forthcoming G8 summit in England, he asserted that the new architecture must be built atop several cornerstones, including a commitment to financial sector openness, good governance, and greater economic transparency. In addition, he suggested that international financial markets required the continuing elaboration of multilateral standards, codes, and best practices if future crises were to be avoided (Camdessus 1998). It did not take long for skeptics of this G8 proposal to rear their heads after all, grandiose phrases like new financial architecture naturally provoked them. In a speech before the World Affairs Council, for example, Berkeley professor and former US Treasury official J. Bradford DeLong stated that there is no world-wide political consensus with respect to the systemic risks facing the global economy and that, as a consequence, dreams of a rebuilt, reformed, and renewed international financial architecture will remain nothing but dreams (DeLong 1999). Beyond these skeptics lurked the critics who whether coming from the left or the right of the political spectrum curiously shared the conspiratorial view that the new international financial architecture represented nothing more than another underhanded attempt by governments and international organizations to bail out reckless banks at taxpayer expense.",2008,2008-08-11,9,the Past and Future of Central Bank Cooperation,,Finance; Business; Systemic risk; Financial market; Position (finance); Financial crisis; Transparency (behavior); Good governance; Treasury; Financial regulation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511510779.004,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=891904 https://core.ac.uk/display/20968361 https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/past-and-future-of-central-bank-cooperation/architects-of-stability-international-cooperation-among-financial-supervisors/3CD67F00BE96A6888BF15ED0649C6EAD https://www.bis.org/publ/work199.htm http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BB14900816 https://www.bis.org/publ/work199.pdf https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/architects-of-stability-international-cooperation-among-financial,lens,009-379-945-733-833

"Agrawala, S.; Fankhauser, S.; Hanrahan, D.; Pope, G.; Skees, J.; Stephens, C.; Yasmine, S.",Economic and policy instruments to promote adaptation,"Adaptation to climate change will comprise of thousands of actions by households, firms, governments, and civil society. This chapter provides some pointers as to how smart policy can turn private initiative into a force for adaptation. It focuses on three instruments: insurance, environmental markets and public private partnerships. Insurance has a long track record as a way to share weather risks. However, as climate damages grow insurance will become riskier. Public policy measures will be needed to overcome this problem, for example through publicly funded adaptation measures that bring down risks or by sharing the most extreme layer of risks with commercial insurers. Public policy should not, however, subsidise the systemic risks, as this may sustain activities that become progressively less viable under the changing climate. Environmental markets and pricing have a key role to play in the preservation of natural systems, even without climate change. They incentivise owners to preserve natural assets and consumers to use them carefully. From an adaptation point of view, environmental markets and pricing serve two main purposes. First, they reduce baseline stress, making systems more resilient. Second, they can help to monetise the adaptation services provided by ecosystems. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), meanwhile, can help to overcome operational constraints and accelerate investment in infrastructure, which will likely be the most expensive part of adaptation and, therefore, put considerable strain on the administrative and financial capacity of governments. PPPs may also play a role in research and development and the search for better adaptation technologies.",2008,2008-07-22,17,Economic Aspects of Adaptation to Climate Change,,Public economics; Baseline (configuration management); Public policy; Climate change; Systemic risk; Political science; Investment (macroeconomics); Damages; Civil society; Adaptation (computer science),http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264046214-5-en,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/economic-aspects-of-adaptation-to-climate-change/economic-and-policy-instruments-to-promote-adaptation_9789264046214-5-en,lens,000-486-202-706-62X

Yet the monitoring of systemic risks posed by the build-up of leverage is hampered by incomplete information on hedge funds' balance sheet positions. This paper describes how an extension of ""regression-based style analysis"" and publicly available data on fund returns yield an indicator of the average amount of funding leverage used by hedge funds. The approach can take into account non-linear exposures through the use of synthetic option returns as possible risk factors. The resulting estimates of leverage are generally plausible for several hedge fund families, in particular those whose returns are well captured by the risk factors used in the estimation. In the absence of more detailed information on hedge fund investments, these estimates can serve as a tool for macro-prudential surveillance of financial system stability.",2008,2008-01-01,20,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Finance; Business; Open-end fund; Alternative beta; Hedge fund; Fund of funds; Hedge accounting; Returns-based style analysis; Fund administration; Performance fee,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1333617,https://autopapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1333617 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1333617 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1333617,lens,008-428-307-977-27X

"Jonna, P.M.",In search of market discipline: the case for indirect hedge fund regulation,"Hedge funds are without a doubt important and controversial players in the financial markets. This was originally evidenced by the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, but the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing hedge fund implosions provided yet another reminder. This is a matter of concern in large part because of the increasing trend of pension funds investing in hedge funds. It is clear that free market restraints have failed to impose adequate market discipline on hedge fund market participants. In addition, direct regulation has proven unlikely and infeasible. Thus, other measures need to be taken in order to establish adequate market discipline. This comment proposes indirectly regulating hedge funds -- placing the regulatory focus on market participants such as pension fund investors and hedge fund creditors. Pursuing this indirect regulatory approach would likely not compel hedge funds to migrate to other jurisdictions (which many argue would be one of the unintended consequences of direct regulation). Thus, this indirect regulatory approach would preserve the many benefits hedge funds provide, while still minimizing systemic risk through increased disclosure.

"Lim, M.M.",Old wine in a new bottle: subprime mortgage crisis causes and consequences,"This paper seeks to explain the causes and consequences of the United States subprime mortgage crisis, and how this crisis has led to a generalized credit crunch in other financial sectors that ultimately affects the real economy. It postulates that, despite the recent financial innovations, the financial strategies leveraging and financial risk mismatching that led to the present crisis are similar to those found in the United States savings-and-loan debacle of the late 1980s and in the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. However, these strategies are based on market innovations that have heightened, not reduced, systemic risks and financial instability. They are as the title implies: old wine in a new bottle. Going beyond these financial practices, the underlying structural causes of the crisis are located in the loose monetary policies of central banks, deregulation, and excess liquidity in financial markets that is a consequence of the kind of economic growth that produces various imbalances trade imbalances, financial sector imbalances, and wealth and income inequality. The consequences of excessive risk, moral hazards, and rolling bubbles are discussed.",2008,2008-04-01,5,Research Papers in Economics,,Systemic risk; Subprime mortgage crisis; Economics; Credit crunch; Market liquidity; Financial market; Financial crisis; Economic inequality; Financial system; Financial risk,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/levwrkpap/wp_5f532.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/levwrkpap/wp_5f532.htm,lens,002-418-804-661-623

"Keil, F.; Bechmann, G.; Kümmerer, K.; Schramm, E.",Systemic risk governance for pharmaceutical residues in drinking water,"Pharmaceuticals are in many cases an indispensable element of a comfortable and healthy life. Nevertheless, there is also a downside to the widespread and increasing use of drugs: the occurrence of their residues in the aquatic environment and in drinking water. Although there is evidence for negative effects of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in some animal and plant species, it has not yet been shown which risks in fact exist for humans and the environment. At the same time there is evidence that people will reject drinking water which contains only the smallest traces of APIs, despite claims that such traces are harmless. In thislange of high uncertainties, subjective risk perception, and the undisputed societal benefit of pharmaceuticals, established risk management procedures are likely to fail. Addressing this issue, the article will suggest applying the concept of systemic risk to the case of APIs in drinking water. With this concept as basis a practical approach to risk management will be presented. It draws upon the recently developed concept of risk governance, as well as the precautionary principle. Finally, concrete measures for risk precaution in the spheres of drug development, handling of drugs, and technical emissions control in urban water management will be presented.",2008,2008-12-04,15,Gaia - Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society,,Business; Systemic risk; Precautionary principle; Risk governance; Urban water management; Corporate governance; Water resource management; Environmental planning,http://dx.doi.org/10.14512/gaia.17.4.10,http://fox.leuphana.de/portal/de/publications/systemic-risk-governance-for-pharmaceutical-residues-in-drinking-water(ddfe0d88-79e4-453d-af36-f557b21917fb).html,lens,000-162-205-311-761
"Lorenz, J.; Battiston, S.",Systemic risk in a network fragility model analyzed with probability density evolution of persistent random walks,"We study the mean field approximation of a recent model of cascades on networks relevant to the investigation of systemic risk control in financial networks. In the model, the hypothesis of a trend reinforcement in the stochastic process describing the fragility of the nodes, induces a trade-off in the systemic risk with respect to the density of the network. Increasing the average link density, the network is first less exposed to systemic risk, while above an intermediate value the systemic risk increases. This result offers a simple explanation for the emergence of instabilities in financial systems that get increasingly interwoven. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the probability density function of the average fragility. This converges to a unique stationary distribution which can be computed numerically and can be used to estimate the systemic risk as a function of the parameters of the model.",2008,2008-01-01,34,Networks & Heterogeneous Media,,Statistics; Random walk; Statistical physics; Systemic risk; Probability density function; Financial networks; Mathematics; Function (mathematics); Fragility; Stochastic process; Stationary distribution,http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/nhm.2008.3.185,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007arXiv0711.1784L/abstract https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/nhm.2008.3.185 https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/12317 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/nhm/nhm3.html#LorenzB08,lens,000-256-968-696-724
"Barnett, W.A.; Chauvet, M.",The end of the great moderation,"The current financial crisis followed the great moderation, according to which some commentators and economists believed that the world’s central banks had gotten so good at countercyclical policy that the business cycle volatility had declined to low levels. As more and more economists and media people became convinced that the risk of recessions had moderated, lenders and investors became willing to increase their leverage and risk-taking activities. Mortgage lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, and home buyers increasingly engaged in activities that would have been considered unreasonably risky, prior to the great moderation that was viewed as having lowered systemic risk. It is the position of this paper that the great moderation did not reflect improved monetary policy, and the perceptions that systemic risk had decreased and that the business cycle had ended were based on other phenomena, such as improved technology and communications. Contributing to the misperceptions about monetary policy solutions was low quality data provided by central banks. Since monetary assets began yielding interest, the simple sum monetary aggregates have had no foundations in economic theory and have sequentially produced one source of misunderstanding after another. The bad data produced by simple sum aggregation have contaminated research in monetary economics, have resulted in needless paradoxes, have produced decades of misunderstandings in economic research and policy, and contributed to the widely held views about decreased systemic risk. While better data, based correctly on index number theory and aggregation theory, now exist, the usual official central bank data are not based on that better approach. While aggregation-theoretic monetary aggregates exist for internal use at the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and many other central banks throughout the world, the only central banks that currently make aggregation-theoretic monetary aggregates available to the public are the Bank of England and the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Dual to the aggregation-theoretic monetary aggregates are the aggregation-theoretic user-cost and interest rate aggregates, which similarly are not in official use by central banks. The failure to use aggregation-theoretic quantity, user-cost price, and interest-rate index numbers as official data by central banks often is connected with the misstatement that expenditure share weights move in a predictable manner, when interest rates change. In fact the direction in which a share will change when an interest rate changes depends upon whether or not the price elasticity of demand is greater than or less than -1. No other area of economics has been so seriously damaged by data unrelated to valid index-number and aggregation theory. We provide evidence supporting the view that misperceptions based upon poor data were responsible for excess risk taking by financial firms and borrowers, and by regulators at central banks. We also provide evidence indicating the poor data may have induced the Federal Reserve to underestimate the rate of growth of monetary services and hence to have fed the bubbles with excess liquidity unintentionally. We also provide evidence indicating that a similar misperception produced an excessively contractionary policy that finally burst the bubble. Many commentators have been quick to blame insolvent financial firms for their greed and their presumed self-destructive, reckless risk taking. Perhaps some of those commentators should look more carefully at their own role in propagating the misperceptions that induced those firms to be willing to take such risks. While there are many considerations relevant to the misguided actions of private firms, individuals, and central banks during the period leading up to the current financial crisis, there is one common thread associated with all of them: misperceptions induced by poor data disconnected from the relevant economic aggregation theory.",2008,2008-11-28,4,Research Papers in Economics,,Monetary policy; Monetary base; Systemic risk; Economics; Interest rate; Market liquidity; Inflation targeting; Quantitative easing; Monetary economics; Great Moderation,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/11817/,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/11817/ https://ideas.repec.org/p/kan/wpaper/200814.html https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/kanwpaper/200814.htm,lens,000-438-651-683-113
"Harijanti, K.; Setyaningtyas, D.; Ks, I.",The management of oral candidosis in diabetic patient with maxillary herpes zoster,"Oral candidosis is an infection caused by mainly Candida albicans. Candida species are common normal flora in the oral cavity and have been reported to be present in 40% to 60% of the population. Candida is predominantly an opportunistic infectious agent. Infection frequency has increased because of the presence of both local and systemic risk factors. The elderly age and diabetes mellitus may decrease the amount of saliva (xerostomia) and potentially increase the risk of colonization and secondary infection by Candida. Herpes Zoster (HZ) is a manifestation of the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus. It is characterized by unilateral, painful, vesicular rash with a dermatomal distribution. The clinical manifestations of this disease can erupt to the skin and mucous membrane. If maxillary nerve is involved, the lesion can appear on unilateral facial skin and oral mucous membrane. PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to report and discuss the difficulties in managing the oral candidosis in elderly patient (57 year old male) who suffered from maxillary Herpes Zoster and diabetes mellitus. Case managementAt first, the patient was treated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and mycostatin oral suspension as topical antimycotic and reffered to dermathology clinic for viral infection treatment, however the oral candidosis did not improved. Subsequently, ketokonazole tablet was given three times daily for three weeks and regulated blood glucose level. In systemic antifungi (ketokonazole) treatment the oral candidosis disappeared.

"Oost, J.",Compartmentalization of dike ring 14an investigation into different compartmentalization strategies to reduce the systemic risk of flooding,"In Dutch water management, compartmentalization is seen as one of the promising risk reduction strategies. The current flood risk policy for dike ring 14 is based on the exceeding probability of10,000 year 1. The flood risk policy is thus based on controlling the probability of flooding and not on the potential effects of flooding. This contrasts to the existing policy in controlling so-called external riskssuch as the risk of nuclear energy or pollution disasters. External risk policy aims at controlling large-scale disasters. External threats are quantified by group risk and the corresponding risk curve (probabilityeffect). Dutch policy for external risks aims to control the number of casualties. Other effects, like environmental and economic effects, are not included in the policy. Flooding becomes more and more an external risk, because of the human interventions in the water system. For flood threat, the approach of systemic risk concentrates on the worst case scenario, which means that a system must be able to handle the worst possible attack. This worst case scenario is based on the potential damage and forms the tail in the risk curve. Reduction of potential damage is the best solution to reduce systemic risk of flooding. Systemic risk has to do with the vulnerability of a whole society, which can be considered as a network of interlinked elements. In this study, the systemic risk is measured by taking the number of affected people, the number of casualties, the direct economic effects and the incoming water as indicators. The aim of this study is: Designing and analyzing different compart-mentalization strategies for the reduction of the flood risk in dike ring 14 in the Netherlands, focusing on the reduction of systemic risk.",2007,2007-01-01,0,,,Environmental resource management; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Engineering; Systemic risk; Vulnerability; Flooding (psychology); Compartmentalization (information security); Worst-case scenario; Flood myth; Dike,https://purl.utwente.nl/essays/57842,https://purl.utwente.nl/essays/57842 https://essay.utwente.nl/57842/,lens,001-151-884-086-262

"Nadolnyak, D.A.; Novak, J.L.; Paz, J.O.",Identifying ENSO phase impacts on area yield insurance rates: an application of non-parametric analysis,"The paper reports of non-parametric analysis of peanut, corn, and cotton yield distributions by the ElNino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases in the Southeastern U.S. For validation purposes, the historical yield data is complemented by a set of simulated peanut yields generated using daily weather data. The hypothesis, justified by the observed South-Eastern climate differences and research on ENSO cycles and planting dates, is that different climate conditions during ENSO cycles translate into different yield distributions and, therefore, insurance premiums (loss to coverage ratios). Kernel density estimates of historical county yield data show consistent patterns in the actuarially fair rate schedules grouped by ENSO phases and geographical areas. In particular, corn and cotton yield insurance premiums appear to be the most dependent on the ENSO phases and are the highest, regardless of coverage, during ElNino and the lowest during LaNina. Peanut premiums are higher during Neutral years and lowest during LaNina. The appear to be robust to the transformations used to make the yield series stationary. While these dependencies do not necessarily correspond to the precipitation and solar radiation characteristics of the corresponding ENSO cycles in the Southeastern US, drawing direct analogies with yield variability is premature as many less documented factors, like the spacing of sunny and rainy days, may be just as important. The comparisons of the empirical and simulated peanut yield distributions show that they are similar in many ways and that the dissimilarities can be explained by known factors. These findings should be more relevant for the area yield insurance as opposed to the APH arrangements as the yield data used in designing contracts for the former reflects the systemic risk more influenced by climate than by the farm-level, basis risk factors accommodated in the APH plans.",2007,2007-01-01,0,Research Papers in Economics,,Statistics; Precipitation; Meteorology; Basis risk; Geography; Weather data; Southern oscillation; Non parametric analysis; El Niño Southern Oscillation; Yield (finance); Kernel density estimation,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ags:aaea07:9718,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ags:aaea07:9718,lens,008-946-467-836-265
"Kambhu, J.; Weidman, S.; Krishnan, N.",Part 4: the payments system and the market for interbank funds,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York released a report -- New Directions for Understanding Systemic Risk -- that presents key findings from a cross-disciplinary conference that it cosponsored in May 2006 with the National Academy of Sciences' Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications. The pace of financial innovation over the past decade has increased the complexity and interconnectedness of the financial system. This development is important to central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, because of their traditional role in addressing systemic risks to the financial system. To encourage innovative thinking about systemic issues, the New York Fed partnered with the National Academy of Sciences to bring together more than 100 experts on systemic risk from 22 countries to compare cross-disciplinary perspectives on monitoring, addressing and preventing this type of risk. This report, released as part of the Bank's Economic Policy Review series, outlines some of the key points concerning systemic risk made by the various disciplines representedincluding economic research, ecology, physics and engineeringas well as presentations on market-oriented models of financial crises, and systemic risk in the payments system and the interbank funds market. The report concludes with observations gathered from the sessions and a discussion of potential applications to policy. The three papers presented in this conference session highlighted the positive feedback effects that produce herdlike behavior in markets, and the subsequent discussion focused in part on means of encouraging heterogeneous investment strategies to counter such behavior.

"Eisenbeis, R.A.; Frame, W.S.; Wall, L.D.",An analysis of the systemic risks posed by fannie mae and freddie mac and an evaluation of the policy options for reducing those risks,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that are central players in U.S. secondary mortgage markets. Over the past decade, these institutions have amassed enormous mortgage- and non-mortgage-oriented investment portfolios that pose significant interest-rate risks to the companies and a systemic risk to the financial system. This paper describes the nature of these risks and systemic concerns and then evaluates several policy options for reducing the institutions' investment portfolios.

"Prezioso, D.; Bartoletti, R.; Damiano, R.; Morgia, G.",Antibacterial prophylaxis in endourological procedures,"Aim Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of postsurgical infections is a common practice in urologic surgery, as well as in endourologic procedures, both in at risk patients (local or systemic risk factors: age, immunological status, metabolic disorders, poor general conditions) or with a positive urine culture, but also in patients with urine previously sterile. As Gram-negative strains are the most common pathogens, it is reasonable to use a quinolone or a beta-lactam. Methods One-hundred and thirty-one patients (range 21-89 years) underwent transurethral cystoscopy (52 cases), vesical catheterism (44 cases), extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (17 cases) and transrectal prostatic biopsy (18 cases). An antimicrobial prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 500 mg (22 patients, 16.8%), levofloxacin 500 mg (54 patients, 41.2%) and prulifloxacin 600 mg (55 patients, 42%) was administered. Globally, the incidence of urinary tract infections during 15 days after surgery was 8.4% (11 cases out of 131): ciprofloxacin 9.1%, levofloxacin 11.1% and prulifloxacin 5.5%, respectively. The patients compliance with the prophylactic treatment was good or excellent in 122 cases (93.1%) and poor incases (6.9%). No major differences between antibiotics used in prophylaxis were detected, keeping into account the limited size of the global population and subgroups defined by the endourological procedures. Prulifoxacin, with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, favourable pharmacokinetic properties and easy to use, can be considered a valid and well tolerated therapeutic option for the antibacterial prophylaxis in endourological procedures, both in hospital and in outpatient setting.",2006,2006-01-01,3,Minerva Urologica E Nefrologica = the Italian Journal of Urology and Nephrology,"adult; aged; aged, 80 and over; antibiotic prophylaxis; biopsy/adverse effects; cystoscopy/adverse effects; female; humans; lithotripsy/adverse effects; longitudinal studies; male; middle aged; postoperative complications/etiology; prostate/pathology; urinary catheterization/adverse effects; urologic surgical procedures/adverse effects",Internal medicine; Ciprofloxacin; Antibiotic prophylaxis; Prulifloxacin; Levofloxacin; Incidence (epidemiology); Antimicrobial; Antibiotics; Medicine; Urinary system,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760885,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16760885/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16760885,lens,000-251-434-957-413
"Alexander, K.",Corporate governance and banks: the role of regulation in reducing the principal-agent problem,"The purpose of this paper is to analyse some of the important issues concerning the corporate governance of banks and financial institutions and the related issues of financial regulation. The paper argues that corporate governance of banks is largely concerned with reducing the social costs of bank risk-taking and that the regulator is uniquely positioned to balance the relevant stakeholder interests in devising governance standards for financial institutions that achieve economic development s, while minimising the externalities of systemic risk. The paper also analyses recent international initiatives in the area of corporate governance and banking, including some of the proposals of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The paper then reviews the legal and regulatory framework of corporate governance in the United Kingdom for banks to illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of the UK approach, and to suggest possible regulatory techniques for other jurisdictions.",2006,2006-02-01,52,Journal of Banking Regulation,,Accounting; Systemic risk; Economics; Capital adequacy ratio; Basel I; Principal–agent problem; Stakeholder; Corporate governance; Financial regulation; Strengths and weaknesses,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jbr.2340003,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057%2Fpalgrave.jbr.2340003.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.jbr.2340003,lens,010-043-724-805-078

We find increased synchronization of real activity since the early 1980s and increased equity markets integration since the early 1990s. We also find that measures of systemic risk at large European financial institutions have not declined during the period 1990-2004 and that bank systemic risk profiles have converged. At the same time, the sensitivity of bank and insurance systemic risk measures to common real and financial shocks has increased in most countries.

"Kaufman, G.G.; Seelig, S.A.","Post-Resolution treatment of depositors at failed banks: implications for the severity of banking crises, systemic risk, and too-big-to-fail","Bank failures are widely viewed in all countries as more damaging to the economy than the failure of other firms of similar size for a number of reasons. The failures may produce losses to depositors and other creditors, break longstanding bank-customer loan relationships, disrupt the payments system, and spill over in domino fashion to other banks, financial institutions and markets, and even to the macro economy (Kaufman, 1996). Thus, bank failures are viewed as potentially more likely to involve contagion or systemic risk than the collapse of other firms. The risk of such actual or perceived damage is often a popular justification for explicit or implicit government-provided or sponsored safety nets under banks, including explicit deposit insurance and implicit government guarantees, such as too-big-to-fail (TBTF), that may protect de jure uninsured depositors and possibly other bank stakeholders against some or all of the loss.1",2006,2006-01-01,32,Bank Restructuring and Resolution,,Business; Systemic risk; Government; Creditor; Bank failure; Loan; Deposit insurance; Too big to fail; Market discipline; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9780230289147_6,https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedhep/y2002iqiip27-41nv.26no.2.html https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230289147_6 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-87511592/post-resolution-treatment-of-depositors-at-failed https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230289147_6,lens,002-247-793-205-679

"Kim, S.H.; Kim, J.W.; Rha, S.W.; Park, C.G.; Seo, H.S.; Oh, D.J.",The influence of coronary dominance on coronary atherosclerosis and distribution of coronary artery disease in korean,"and s:Common anatomical variations exist within the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are equally exposed to systemic risk factors however, coronary angiography has shown a focal and uneven distribution of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that the nature of coronary arteries, such as the coronary dominance, is one of the local factors able to determine the morphology and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. The relationship between the coronary dominance and the distribution of coronary artery atherosclerosis however, remains to be investigated. Subjects and Methods:A total 264 patients were enrolled for analysis. Using the ACC AHA definition, the coronary dominance was assessed as either a right dominant, left dominant or balanced dominant artery. The degree of the coronary artery stenosis was obtained using a scoring system. By means of the sum of the numerical values in the three vessels, the total left anterior descending artery (LAD), total left circumflex artery (LCX) and total right coronary artery (RCA) scores were calculated. :Of the 264 patients, right, left and balanced dominance was found in 73.5, 16.3 and 10.2%, respectively. The total LAD, LCX and RCA scores were similar in the patients from all three dominance groups (p 0.05). The score for coronary artery disease were shown to be higher in the proximal and mid segments (LAD,0.000 LCX,0.002 RCA,0.041). Conclusion:The coronary dominance was not found to relate to the angiographic severity of coronary artery disease. The distribution of coronary disease in the three coronary arteries tended to cluster within the proximal and mid segments of the vessels.

"Simpson, J.L.; Evans, J.",Benchmarking and crosschecking international banking economic and regulatory capital,"The purpose of this paper is to provide banking regulators with another tool to crosscheck the appropriateness and consistency of levels of capital adequacy for banks. The process begins by examining banking systems and focuses on market risks and the systemic risks associated with growing global economic integration and associated systemic interdependence. The model provides benchmarks for economic and regulatory capital for international banking systems using country, regional and global stock market generated price index returns data. The benchmarks can then be translated to crosschecking capital levels for banks within those systems. For analytical purposes systems are assumed to possess a degree of informational efficiency and credit, liquidity and operational risks are held constant or at least assumed to be covered in loan loss provisions. An empirical study is included that demonstrates how market risk and systemic risk can be accounted for in a benchmark banking system performance model. Full testing of the model is left for future research.

The relationship between consolidation, conglomeration and financial risk is documented using financial data on the largest 500 financial firms worldwide and on large banks in about 90 countries. We find that (a) large conglomerate firms did not exhibit levels of risk-taking lower than smaller and specialized firms in 1995, while they exhibited higher levels of risk-taking in 2000 (b) highly concentrated banking systems exhibited levels of systemic risk potential higher than less concentrated systems during the 1993 2000 period, and this relationship has strengthened during the 1997 2000 period. We outline research directions aimed at explaining why bank consolidation and conglomeration may not necessarily yield either safer financial firms or more resilient banking systems.",2004,2004-01-01,274,"Financial Markets, Institutions and Instruments",,Business; Systemic risk; Consolidation (business); Firm risk; Yield (finance); Financial system; Financial risk; Internationalization,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0963-8008.2004.00076.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-8008.2004.00076.x http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0963-8008.2004.00076.x/abstract,lens,003-574-030-524-959
"Cifuentes, R.",Banking concentration: implications for systemic risk and safety-net design,"This paper explores the impact of banking concentration on safety net design in particular, deposit insurance and on systemic risk. The paper focuses on a system characterized by high concentration and low total number of banks. Each issue is addressed separately. The first section discusses best practices in deposit insurance design and derives for the case we are interested in. One is that in this context deposit insurance cannot be thought of as a stand-alone instrument, but rather must be understood as an element of the intervention and resolution policy. The second part of the paper studies systemic risk in such a system, using the Eisenberg and Noe (2001) approach to model and study risk in a network of banks. A working metric of the too big to fail situation can be derived in the model. More importantly, this section shows how the risk of idiosyncratic shocks spreading through the system are substantially higher in concentrated systems than in decentralized ones. Finally, the paper proposes and evaluates a specific regulatory measure that successfully contains systemic risk.",2004,2004-01-01,4,,,Business; Systemic risk; Actuarial science; Metric (unit); Best practice; Deposit insurance; Safety net; Context (language use); Too big to fail; Intervention (law),https://ideas.repec.org/h/chb/bcchsb/v07c13pp359-385.html,https://ideas.repec.org/h/chb/bcchsb/v07c13pp359-385.html,lens,007-006-297-790-447

A rise in the minimum solvency ratio does not necessarily reduce the adverse consequences of moral hazard: bank efficiency may fall and expected bailout costs may rise.

"Wells, S.",Financial interlinkages in the united kingdom's interbank market and the risk of contagion,"A well functioning interbank market is essential for efficient financial intermediation. But interbank exposures imply the possibility of direct contagion: the insolvency of a single institution may trigger multiple bank failures due to direct credit exposures. The complete network of interbank exposures that gives rise to this channel of contagion is not observable, making it difficult to assess the systemic risk it poses. This paper uses data on loans and deposits between UK-resident banks to estimate the distribution of bilateral exposures. The potential for contagion is examined by assuming the sudden failure of each individual bank and estimating the losses incurred to other banks as a result of the initial shock. This study suggests that, while a single bank failure is rarely sufficient to trigger the outright failure of other banks, it does have the potential to weaken substantially the capital holdings of the banking system. And, when the failure of a single bank does result in knock-on effects, their severity depends greatly on the maintained assumptions about the distribution of interbank loans and the level of loss given default. But data constraints mean that drawing definitive is difficult.",2004,2004-09-01,16,Research Papers in Economics,,Loss given default; Systemic risk; Economics; Interbank lending market; Bank failure; Insolvency; Shock (economics); Monetary economics; Financial intermediary; Capital (economics),https://ideas.repec.org/p/boe/boeewp/230.html,https://ideas.repec.org/p/boe/boeewp/230.html,lens,001-683-318-475-332

First, we discuss how certain institutional features of emerging economies (underdeveloped capital markets, pervasive government ownership of banks, greater guarantees, inadequate disclosure and transparency) may affect market responses to bank risk. Second, using the recent Argentine crisis as an illustration, we argue that systemic risks may exert an overwhelming impact on market behavior, overshadowing the link between the latter and bank fundamentals. Thus, market discipline, while missing in the traditional sense, may be indeed quite robust once systemic risks are factored in. We conclude that in emerging economies the analysis of market discipline should take into account the importance of institutional and systemic factors.",2004,2004-01-01,20,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Finance; Nonmarket forces; Emerging markets; Capital market; Business; Systemic risk; Factor market; Transparency (market); Market discipline; Market behavior; Monetary economics,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.532465,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=532465,lens,009-072-545-064-478
"Pradhan, S.; Sumpio, B.E.",Molecular and biological effects of hemodynamics on vascular cells,"A variety of systemic risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes have been found to promote atherosclerosis. Although these elements affect blood vessels equally, clinically significant lesions develop at predictable locations, i.e., major branch points and bifurcations. This suggests that the development of clinically significant atherosclerotic plaques involves a complex interplay between vascular anatomy, vascular biology and hemodynamic forces. Cyclic strain, circumferential pulsatile pressure exerted upon a vessel wall, has been found to cause changes in endothelial cells that tend to disfavor atherosclerosis formation. Cultured endothelial cells have been shown to migrate, proliferate and alter cytoskeletal alignment in response to cyclic strain. Levels of macromolecules such as prostacyclin, endothelin, nitric oxide and tissue plasminogen activator have been found to be altered by cyclic strain. Additionally, cyclic strain has been shown to stimulate expression of cellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and intracellular second messenger systems such as the adenylate cyclase-cAMP, diacylglycerol-IP3, and protein kinasepathways.

"Koopman, S.J.; Lucas, A.",Business and default cycles for credit risk,"This discussion paper led to an article in the Journal of Applied Econometrics (2005). Vol. 20, issue 2, pages 311-323. Various economic theories are available to explain the existence of credit and default cycles. There remains empirical ambiguity, however, as to whether or these cycles coincide. Recent papers new suggest by their empirical research set-up that they do, or at least that defaults and credit spreads tend to co-move with macro-economic variables. If true, this is important for credit risk management as well as for regulation and systemic risk management. In this paper, we use 1927-1997 U.S. data on real GDP, credit spreads, and business failure rates to shed new light on the empirical evidence. We use a multivariate unobserved components framework to disentangle credit from business cycles. It turns out that cyclical co-movements arise between default rates, but not real GDP. There is, however, a contemporaneous correlation between real GDP and default rates. Regarding the longer term evolution of the series, credit spreads influence default rates and real GDP, but not vice versa. This corroborates some of the empirical findings in the recent literature on the correlation between macrovariables and default rates. It also suggests the use of credit spreads besides or instead of economic growth rates to forecast the dynamics of future default rates.",2003,2003-01-09,161,Research Papers in Economics,,Business cycle; Business failure; Credit crunch; Credit risk; Credit valuation adjustment; Default; Economics; Empirical evidence; Empirical research; Monetary economics; Real gross domestic product; Systemic risk; iTraxx,https://ideas.repec.org/p/tin/wpaper/20030062.html,http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/handle/1871/44379 http://mx.nthu.edu.tw/~jtyang/Teaching/Risk_management/Papers/Correlations/Business%20and%20Default%20Cycles%20for%20Credit%20Risk.pdf http://papers.tinbergen.nl/03062.pdf http://www.financerisks.com/filedati/WP/Common_factor/03062.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/21010795 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:jae:japmet:v:20:y:2005:i:2:p:311-323 https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/tinwpaper/20030062.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/japmet/v20y2005i2p311-323.html https://ideas.repec.org/p/tin/wpaper/20030062.html https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jae.833 https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/business-and-default-cycles-for-credit-risk-2 https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1909073/158831.pdf https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/85925/1/03062.pdf https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/85925 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F20b40e98-09f5-42c2-b3f9-08d7924e3d83,lens,003-343-280-468-939

"Lehar, A.",Measuring systemic risk: A risk management approach,"This paper proposes a new method to measure and monitor the systemic risk in a banking system. Standard tools that regulators require banks to use for their internal risk management are applied at the level of the banking system to measure the risk of the regulator's portfolio. Using a sample of international banks from 1988 until 1999,estimate correlations between bank asset portfolios and compute different measures of systemic risk. The portfolio aspect of the regulator's deposit insurance liability is explicitly considered and the methodology allows a comparison of sub-samples from different countries. Correlations, bank asset volatility, and bank capitalization increase for North American and somewhat for European banks, while Japanese banks face deteriorating capital levels and increasing volatility of their asset portfolios. In the sample period, the North American banking system gains stability while the Japanese banking sector becomes more fragile. The expected future liability of the regulator varies substantially over time and is especially high during the Asian crisis starting in 1997. Further analysis shows that the Japanese banks contribute most to the volatility of the regulator's liability at that time. Larger and more profitable banks have lower systemic risk and additional equity capital reduces systemic risk only for banks that are constrained by regulatory capital requirements.",2003,2003-01-01,45,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,Finance; Systemic risk; Economics; Deposit insurance; Liability; Portfolio; Capital requirement; Risk management; Financial risk management; Monetary economics; Volatility (finance),http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.423984,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID423984_code030726600.pdf?abstractid=423984 https://ssrn.com/abstract=423984 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=423984,lens,003-241-929-682-933

"Addy, M.; Martin, M.",Systemic antimicrobials in the treatment of chronic periodontal diseases: a dilemma,"The use of systemic antimicrobials in the treatment of acute and chronic periodontal diseases must be viewed as a dilemma. On the one hand, the approach is attractive because of the microbial nature of periodontal diseases but, on the other hand, evidence of benefit of these agents is equivocal for the majority of periodontal diseases and antimicrobials have the potential to cause harm. The disadvantages of systemic antimicrobials can be grouped under the headings of allergic reactions, superinfection, toxicity, drug interactions, patient compliance and, perhaps of most widespread importance, bacterial resistance. Mechanical debridement methods, including drainage of pus for acute periodontal abscesses, should be considered the first line treatment for most periodontal diseases. Systemic antimicrobials should be considered as adjuncts to mechanical debridement methods and, in chronic disease, never used alone as they can predispose to abscess formation. Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials may be considered in acute disease where debridement or drainage of pus is difficult, where there is local spread or systemic upset. In chronic periodontal diseases, adjunctive antimicrobials should be considered in early onset or rapidly progressive disease or in advanced chronic adult disease where mechanical therapies have failed or surgery is not a preferred option. Inadequate oral hygiene and tobacco smoking are contraindications to the use of antimicrobials. The value of systemic antimicrobials, where other systemic risk factors co-exist, has still to be established.

"Qiao, G.L.; Riviere, J.E.",Systemic uptake and cutaneous disposition of pentachlorophenol in a sequential exposure scenario: effects of skin preexposure to benzo a pyrene,"Characterizing interactions caused by sequential skin exposures to various environmental toxicants can be critical for a meaningful risk assessment. To assess sequential chemical exposure effect on chemical cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of a toxicant, (14)C pentachlorophenol (PCP) was topically administered in three porcine skin models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro) at 40 microcm(2) with or without skin preexposure to benzo a pyrene (BaP), a known human carcinogen and cutaneous cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) inducer. In the mass balance studies, BaP skin preexposure was found to enhance (14)C absorption in all three models with detectable in vivo effect during the first several days. Total 8-h absorption was tripled by skin preexposure to BaP in the ex vivo (1.1 to 3.2%) and in vitro (0.20 to 0.66%) systems. As seen in the extended in vivo studies, total absorption was 50-57% regardless of exposure conditions, suggesting the prolonged observation period may conceal existing impact of potentially modified disposition processes, such as cutaneous metabolism, on systemic absorption. Skin preexposure to the skin CYP450 inducer BaP largely changed label penetration depth and distribution pattern in cutaneous tissues and decreased (14)C concentration in skin and fat. Additionally, BaP preexposure altered (14)C systemic tissue disposition, suggesting that altered cutaneous PCP disposition may eventually change the toxicity profile (cutaneous vs. systemic risk).

"Crockett, A.; Cohen, B.H.",Financial markets and systemic risk in an era of innovation,"This essay reviews some of the more significant ongoing changes in the global financial system over the past decade and identifies implications these changes have had for systemic stability and for the role of public authorities. Trends such as disintermediation and financial sector con-solidation have modified the ways in which systemic shocks are propagated and distributed among market participants. This has complicated the role of banks, which continue to stand at the centre of the financial system in many countries. While the overall will no doubt continue to be positive for households and businesses, this complexity increases the potential for uncertainty, particularly during the period when new markets and institutions are developing. These developments have also complicated the roles of financial regulators, including central banks. The response has been a move towards a greater reliance on transparency and market discipline as ways to improve the spread of information and thus prevent systemic disruption. There has been an increased recognition of the systemic significance of a diverse range of markets and channels of intermediation to the health of the financial system.",2001,2001-01-01,6,International Finance,,Capital market; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Financial market participants; Indirect finance; Inter-dealer broker; Financial regulation; Financial system; Financial risk,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-2362.00068,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-2362.00068,lens,002-723-569-580-591
"Kuhner, C.",Financial rating agencies are they credible insights into the reporting incentives of rating agencies in times of enhanced systemic risk,"The paper asks if credit rating agencies have incentives to misrepresent their clients’ credit quality during an ongoing systemic crisis. Two important elements are essential for a systemic crisis: (1) Investors are not able to distinguish fundamentally healthy debtors from fundamentally unhealthy ones. (2) Investors tend to cumulatively withdraw their funds. Therefore, neither fundamentally healthy nor unhealthy debtors can be expected to survive a creditor’s exit. We model a signaling game that reflects these two assumptions and several others. The game focuses on the creditor’s financial pay-offs and the agency’s reputational pay-offs. We show that there are no separating equilibria in which agencies report observed credit quality truthfully and creditors make their withdrawal decision contingent on this report. Depending on the relevant parameters, four different equilibria emerge. In three of these equilibria, rating assignments are always ignored by the creditors. Only in one equilibrium, there is limited transmission of decision-useful information as both players will adopt mixed strategies. Pure strategy equilibria in which rating assignments reflect decision-useful information can develop for a certain scope of parameters if some of the above mentioned assumptions are relaxed, i.e. (1) if fundamentally healthy firms can survive cumulative creditor’s withdrawal with positive probability, or (2) if two rating agencies successively evaluate the debtor.

"Elman, M.J.; Raden, R.Z.; Carrigan, A.",Intravitreal injection of tissue plasminogen activator for central retinal vein occlusion,"Purpose: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of intravitreal injections of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Methods: Between August 1997 and October 2000,eyes with CRVO were treated with intravitreal injection of tPA, 100 (50 0.1mL), and paracentesis. After the injection, each patient was placed at strict bed rest in the supine position forhours. Each patient was administered one baby aspirin daily. Best corrected visual acuity with Light House charts was obtained at each visit. A change ofor more lines of vision from pretreatment levels atmonths’ follow-up or a change in one level (ie, counting fingers to hand motions) was deemed significant.All patients were followed up for at leastmonths. Four ofeyes (44%) showedor more lines improvement atmonths. In this group, the average improvement waslines. Two eyes showedor more lines loss of vision atmonths. Four eyes showed dramatic improvement in visual acuity withinmonth of injection. There were no adverse effects related to treatment. Three eyes subsequently developed retinal or anterior-segment neovascularization requiring panretinal photocoagulation all were graded as ischemic CRVO on fluorescein angiography at baseline. Conclusion: Intravitreal tPA can be injected safely and easily. Local injection of tPA should spare the patient the serious systemic risks of intravenous tPA administration, such as stroke.

"Newman, A.B.",Peripheral arterial disease: insights from population studies of older adults,"Epidemiologic studies illustrate that PAD is a very common finding when screening is performed in older adults. The outcomes in those with PAD in population studies reflect and extend the findings from clinical studies of PAD, confirming that older adults with PAD are disabled and have a high risk for CVD and total mortality. With the aging of the population, the prevalence of PAD is increasing. It is common in both men and women and increases in prevalence with age, such that at least 12% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older will have significant disease on noninvasive testing, most without classic intermittent claudication. Furthermore, PAD is strongly related to other manifestations of CVD and its risk factors. Those with PAD identified in epidemiologic studies have a two- to three-fold risk in CVD morbidity and mortality. Current treatment goals for PAD patients include improving function, primarily using exercise and medical therapy, and reduction of systemic risk and can be extended to those identified by screening. In addition, PAD must be thought of as a marker of advanced systemic atherosclerosis. Inasmuch as the risk of CVD and mortality in those with PAD is similar to those with a history of MI or stroke, those with PAD can be approached with the same measures for secondary CVD prevention as recommended for MI and stroke survivors. A simple bedside measure of the AAI can be used to improve the detection of PAD in clinical practice. Although there is no study that shows directly that screening and preventive treatment will reduce complications of PAD, a preventive approach in PAD patients is likely to improve overall survival, reduce MI, and will, perhaps, also reduce the risk of disabling leg pain and amputation.

"Honohan, P.",Perverse effects of a ratings-related capital adequacy system,"It has recently been proposed that banks be allowed to hold less capital against loans to borrowers who have received a favorable rating by an approved rating agency. But a plausible model of rating-agency behavior shows that this strategy could have perverseactually increasing the risk of deposit insurance outlays. First, there is an issue of signaling, with low-ability borrowers possibly altering their behavior to secure a lower capital requirement for their borrowing. Second, establishing a regulatory cut-off may actually reduce the amount of risk information made available by raters. Besides, the credibility of rating agencies may not be damaged by neglect of the risk of unusual systemic shocks, although deposit insurers greatest outlays come chiefly at times of systemic crisis. And using agencies'individual ratings is unlikely to be an effective early-warning system for the risk of systemic failure, so use of the ratings could lull policymakers into a false sense of security. It is important to harness market information to improve bank safety (for example, by increasing the role of large, well-informed, but uninsured claimants), but this particular approach could be counterproductive. Relying on ratings could induce borrowers to increase their exposure to systemic risk even if they reduce exposure to specific risk.",2000,2000-06-30,1,Research Papers in Economics,,Business; Systemic risk; Capital adequacy ratio; Deposit insurance; Credibility; Specific risk; Capital requirement; Monetary economics; Financial intermediary; Capital (economics),https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:2364,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:2364 https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/2364.html,lens,007-017-319-642-124

The availability of a portable device, called the CoaguCheksystem, allows patient self-monitoring. In this study, this self-monitoring system is described. Then a risk analysis by means of Failure Mode Effect Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis was applied. This systemic risk analysis revealed system weaknesses with respect to education, compliance, and technical reliability. This type of risk analysis used by the prescribing physicians can assist in recognizing increased risks of failure in the individual case as well as in analysing adverse events. 1.1. Oral anticoagulation Oral anticoagulation by means of coumarin derivatives (vitamin-K antagonists) is an effective modal- ity for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with prosthetic heart valves, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease, after myocardial infarction, and during chronic atrial fibrillation (1). The biological effect of coumarin derivatives (measured by means of the prothrombin time (PT)) is extremely variable, which can be aggravated by various drugs, inconstant vitamin-K intake, and illnesses (vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile infection). PT fluctuations can also be due to inadequate patient coun- selling and poor patient compliance with respect to medication intake (2-4). Incorrect dosage, with either too much or too little of the medication, increases the risk of hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complica- tions, respectively, necessitating frequent laboratory visits for venepunctures and dose adjustments.

"Malek, A.M.; Izumo, S.; Alper, S.L.",Modulation by pathophysiological stimuli of the shear stress-induced up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in endothelial cells,"Fluid shear stress (the frictional force resulting from blood flow) is a principal regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. We examined the responses of eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels to dynamic shear stimuli in the presence of pathological risk modifiers. METHODS: Confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells were subjected in vitro to shear stress (using a cone-plate viscometer) and to hydrostatic pressure (using a custom-built pressure chamber device). eNOS mRNA levels were quantitated by densitometric analysis of Northern blots.In contrast to steady laminar shear stress, which elevated eNOS mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner (2.9- and 3.6-fold afterh atand 20 dyn cm, respectively), steady hydrostatic pressure of 150 mm Hg decreased eNOS mRNA levels by 46%. eNOS mRNA up-regulation by shear stress was reversible after cessation of flow, although it was not influenced by previous shear exposure, and it was not mediated by a stable transferable factor, eNOS mRNA up-regulation by sinusoidal shear stress was frequency-dependent, with a moderate response at 1-Hz oscillating shear and no change at 0.3 Hz. Hypoxia (3%2suppressed eNOS mRNA expression by 78% under static conditions and by 72% under shear conditions but did not alter the fold induction by shear. Elevated glucose concentrations reduced eNOS mRNA levels in both resting and shear stress-exposed cells but did not reduce the fold induction by shear the protein kinaseinhibitor calphostinwas without effect. Shear-induced up-regulation of eNOS mRNA was unaffected by changes in the medium partial pressure of COpH, by the Na -exchanger inhibitor HOE694, or by aspirin. In contrast, the shear response was potentiated by homocysteine. CONCLUSION: Both physical and chemical stimuli regulate eNOS mRNA levels in endothelial cells. Although eNOS mRNA expression is increased by shear stress, it is decreased by hydrostatic pressure, hypoxia, and elevated glucose levels. The effect of shear on eNOS mRNA expression involves a reversible, frequency-dependent process.

The development of these markets requires not only new products, new players and global rules, but also a robust financial infrastructure that ensures efficient, secure and timely clearing, settlement and payment of financial transactions. Technology has been a major contributor to the development of financial markets. Until recently, growth in the volume of financial transactions was constrained by the physical burden of paper-based transactions and the capacity to communicate information. However, once information could be reduced to electronic form, large amounts of financial information as well as value could be processed and transferred across markets. By linking local markets through networks, technology has created the global market. It has flattened the hierarchy of business by cutting out inefficient layers and middlemen, so that the producer can reach the consumer directly. It has also ""empowered"" the individual consumer and producer by increasing his access to information, his capacity to process that information and his capacity to reach out directly to other consumers and producers almost without restraint. Towards this end, Asian central banks are beginning to introduce Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) inter-bank payment systems as the cornerstone of a modern electronic financial system. At the same time, the stock exchanges, futures markets and debt markets are also adopting modern clearing and settlement systems using the latest computer and telecommunications technology As global technology standards and market practices begin to converge, technology has become available to link domestic markets together to facilitate seamless trading in financial instruments. Yet many cross-border links between Asian financial markets are indirect and often inefficient. An Asian Monetary Network--a ""system of systems"" that links market participants internationally--is needed to build the intra-regional market infrastructure of the 21st century. This innovation would greatly enhance central and commercial bankers' efforts to eliminate systemic risk--the risk that failure of one party in a payment system will cause the failure of other parties to meet payments. It will also reduce liquidity, credit and Herstatt risks.(1) One such emerging network within this framework is the move to link RTGS systems so that financial transactions can eventually be conducted on a payment versus payment (PvP) and delivery versus payment (DVP) basis. This would reduce and eliminate many of the payment system risks currently inherent in the existing systems. From the perspective of a central banker, the overriding policy concern is to ensure that these inter-bank crossborder exposures are fully understood and that effective steps are being taken to reduce and even eliminate them if it is possible and cost-effective to do so. The other emerging network within the Asian Monetary Network is AsiaClear, the concept of linking Asian debt clearing and settlement systems. TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IN EAST ASIA Asia is still largely a cash and paper-based payments society, with Japan being very much in the vanguard of using electronic payment systems. At last count, there were roughly 150,000 Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) and 250 million credit cards in eight East Asian economies, of which 125,000 ATMs and 225 million credit cards were in Japan. In China, the number of ATMs and credit cards has risen to 12,000 and 20 million respectively, with an additional 100 million cash dispenser cards. But transactions are still paper-based, with an average of 540,000 checks valued at U.S. $5 billion cleared daily while electronic payments amount to 12,000 transactions valued at U.",1998,1998-03-22,4,Journal of International Affairs,,Delivery versus payment; Payment; Economics; Financial transaction; Straight-through processing; Financial instrument; Financial market; Payment system; Real-time gross settlement; Commerce,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-54117790/the-impact-of-technology-on-financial-development,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-54117790/the-impact-of-technology-on-financial-development,lens,004-218-577-252-577

"Waldman, B.J.; Mont, M.A.; Hungerford, D.S.",Total knee arthroplasty infections associated with dental procedures,"Total knee arthroplasties are at risk for hematogenous seeding secondary to procedures that create a transient bacteremia. To define the risk of infection associated with dental surgery, a retrospective review of the records of 3490 patients treated with total knee arthroplasty by the authors between 1982 and 1993 was performed. Sixty-two total knee arthroplasties with late infections (greater thanmonths after their procedure) were identified, and of these, seven infections were associated strongly with a dental procedure temporally and bacteriologically. These seven cases represented 11% of the identified infections or 0.2% of the total knee arthroplasty procedures performed during this period. In addition, among 12 patients referred for infected total knee arthroplasties from outside institutions, two infections were associated with a dental procedure. Five of the nine (56%) patients had systemic risk factors that predisposed them to infection, including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. All dental procedures were extensive in nature (average, 115 minutes range, 75-205 minutes). Eight of the patients received no antibiotic prophylaxis. One patient had only one preoperative dose. Infections associated with dental procedures may be more common than previously suspected. Eight of these patients had no prophylactic antibiotics, and one had inadequate coverage. The authors think that patients with a total knee arthroplasty who have systemic disease that compromises host defense mechanisms against infections and who undergo extensive dental procedures should receive prophylactic antibiotics.

"Gonzalez-Hermosillo, B.",Banking sector fragility and systemic sources of fragility,"A theoretical framework to assess the degree of fragility or, inversely, the soundness of the banking system is proposed. It is argued that, while a bank may be either solvent or insolvent at any given time, its degree of fragility must be a forward-looking measure based on the probability that it can withstand a destabilizing shock. Externalities are particularly important because they can constitute a serious source of systemic risk. The factors that determine banks’ soundness can be separated into bank-specific and those common to all banks (subject to microprudential and macroprudential considerations, respectively).

"Genco, R.J.",Current view of risk factors for periodontal diseases,"Periodontal diseases are infections, and many forms of the disease are associated with specific pathogenic bacteria which colonize the subgingival area. At least two of these microorganisms, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, also invade the periodontal tissue and are virulent organisms. Initiation and progression of periodontal infections are clearly modified by local and systemic conditions called risk factors. The local factors include pre-existing disease as evidenced by deep probing depths and plaque retention areas associated with defective restorations. Systemic risk factors recently have been identified by large epidemiologic studies using multifactorial statistical analyses to correct for confounding or associated co-risk factors. Risk factors which we know today as important include diabetes mellitus, especially in individuals in whom metabolic control is poor, and cigarette smoking. These two risk factors markedly affect the initiation and progression of periodontitis, and attempts to manage these factors are now an important component of prevention and treatment of adult periodontitis. Systemic conditions associated with reduced neutrophil numbers or function are also important risk factors in children, juveniles, and young adults. Diseases in which neutrophil dysfunction occurs include the lazy leukocyte syndrome associated with localized juvenile periodontitis, cyclic neutropenia, and congenital neutropenia. Recent studies also point to several potentially important periodontal risk indicators. These include stress and coping behaviors, and osteopenia associated with estrogen deficiency. There are also determinants associated with periodontal disease including gender (with males having more disease), age (with more disease seen in the elderly), and hereditary factors. The study of risk in periodontal disease is a rapidly emerging field and much is yet to be learned. However, there are at least two significant risk factors-smoking and diabetes-which demand attention in current management of periodontal disease.Periodontol 1996 67:1041-1049.",1996,1996-01-01,672,Journal of Periodontology,actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; actinobacillus infections; adolescent; adult; age factors; aged; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans/pathogenicity; bacteroidaceae infections; bacteroides forsythus; child; dental plaque/microbiology; diabetes complications; disease progression; epidemiologic methods; female; fusobacterium nucleatum; humans; leukocyte count; male; neutropenia/complications; neutrophils/cytology; osteopenia; periodontal diseases/etiology; periodontal diseases/microbiology; periodontal pocket/microbiology; periodontitis microbiology; periodontitis/etiology; periodontium/microbiology; porphyromonas gingivalis; porphyromonas gingivalis/pathogenicity; prevotella intermedia; risk factors; risk factors/diabetes; sex factors; smoking; smoking/adverse effects; stress; virulence; wolinella recta,Dentistry; Immunology; Young adult; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Cyclic neutropenia; Disease; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Periodontitis; Congenital Neutropenia; Diabetes mellitus; Biology; Medicine; Periodontal disease; Current (fluid); Risk analysis (engineering); Engineering; Electrical engineering,http://dx.doi.org/10.1902/jop.1996.67.10.1041,https://aap.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1902/jop.1996.67.10s.1041 https://www.joponline.org/doi/abs/10.1902/jop.1996.67.10.1041 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/8910821 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29539789/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8910821 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1902/jop.1996.67.10s.1041?journalCode=jop https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1902/jop.1996.67.10s.1041,lens,000-800-249-003-684

Periodontal diseases are infections with a high potential for recurrence, progressive loss of attachment and eventually, tooth loss. Current therapies for periodontal diseases are highly predictable in arresting disease activity. Supportive periodontal care has been shown to be very effective in maintaining support when adapted to each particular case. Nevertheless, current maintenance therapies may be unsuccessful in preventing further loss of attachment in a small number of sites for some patients. Tests aiming at bacterial identification and the subgingival application of antimicrobials may be helpful in the management of such cases, however the practical value in a specific setting is not known. There is growing evidence of the fundamental role of personal oral hygiene in supportive periodontal care.

"Kuussaari, H.",Systemic risk in the finnish payment system: an empirical investigation,"The volume of large-value funds transfers in the money, foreign exchange and securities markets has increased manifold during the last decade.This development has increased interbank debt positions and extensions of intraday credit resulting from payment transactions in the payment-intermediation sector. Systemic risk in these arrangements refers to the risk that one clearing system participant's failure to settle will cause one or more other participants to default.The danger of systemic failure exists in a clearing system in which payment messages are exchanged during the day but funds are transferred only at the end of the day.In this study, simulation with empirical data is used to measure the probability, extent and resulting effects of a systemic crisis in the Finnish payment system. The major finding of the study is that one participant's failure to settle in the Finnish payment system can cause serious problems for other participants but the danger of systemic failure is relatively small.On average the banks' largest counterparty risks are low and amount to less than 10 per cent of their own funds.However, on some days counterparty risk can amount to over 50 per cent of banks' own funds and thus constitute a systemic risk.Large counterparty risks however do not form long interbank chains that could lead to a domino effect.Even should a payment system participant suddenly be unable to settle, the other participants would probably manage to avoid serious problems. Although the simulation indicate that presently the probability of systemic crisis in Finland is quite small, it is still important that payment system risk control be further developed.The environment in which the payment system operates is developing very rapidly, and risks are growing as volumes increase.As the system opens up to foreign credit institutions, Finnish payment system participants also find themselves dealing with more and more counterparties about whom they have no prior knowledge.System entry and risk control can no longer be based solely on trust clear game rules are needed.As part of its task of overseeing payment systems, the central bank will need to closely monitor system developments, promote risk awareness in the markets and payment systems, and prevent the creation of systems in which it is possible for settlement failures to spread.This work should be done in cooperation with international organizations and the EU.

Despite the widespread attention to derivatives, there has been little systematic analysis. We estimate market values and interest-rate sensitivities of interest-rate swap positions of U.S. commercial banks to empirically address the question of whether swap contracts have increased or decreased systemic risk in the U.S. banking system.

"Eisenberg, L.",Connectivity and financial network shutdown,"Connectivity is a measure of the number of connections in a network. It is applied here to financial network shutdown due to inter-institutional default. Since 1797 when Sir Francis Baring introduced the concept of lender of last resort"" concepts such as ""too-big-to fail"", ""lender-of-last-resort"" and ""systemic risk"" have belied a need for a quantitative approach. With the increase in the market for over-the-counter inter-institutional contracts, especially the interbank market for foreign exchange, interest has increased on the consequences of an unwind in payments due to default. To date one paper, which is not purely descriptive, has been published on the effects of defaults in payments systems. That paper reports the of three scenarios for settlement in CHIPS, one of two US dollar payments systems. By contrast, analytic (not inferred by simulation) of the statistical properties of payments mechanisms are obtained in this paper. These are derived given the simple clearing mechanisms of no netting and bilateral netting, and are derived using Boolean graphs. The model is applied to default propagation transition matrices. Specifically, the concepts of network architecture and connectivity of that architecture are defined. Starting from assumptions on the connection matrix. Markov transition matrices are derived where each state is the number of firms in default. Debt maturity, connectivity and initial defaults are used to calculate the transition matrices. Besides deriving the stochastic difference equations for the number of failed firms via Markov matrices, were obtained on the effect of netting liabilities on bankruptcy propagation. The propagation of bankruptcy was compared for liabilities which offset (are netted) and those which do not. It is shown that the connectivity value which maximizes the speed of default propagation under netting is not that when liabilities do not offset. For netting liabilities this value is2. For non-offsetting liabilities this value is 1. The benefit of netting given a level of connectivity, g, is the reduction in connectivity which is the connectivity squared, g'. Finally, were obtained demonstrating that when bankruptcy propagation is fast relative to the maturity of obligations, the bankruptcy propagation over the network can be less extensive than then propagation is slower. Also, given the time scale of propagation, shortening the maturity of obligations not only may increase the extent of propagation, but definitely increases its speed.",1995,1995-04-01,3,Research Papers in Economics,,Finance; Clearing; Systemic risk; Interbank lending market; Offset (computer science); Maturity (finance); Computer science; Bankruptcy; Default; Markov chain,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wop:safiwp:95-04-041,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/wopsafiwp/95-04-041.htm https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:wop:safiwp:95-04-041,lens,002-178-897-799-41X

"Sellon, G.H.",Changing capital markets: implications for monetary policyA summary of the bank's 1993 symposium,"Financial markets throughout the world have changed substantially in recent years as capital markets have become deeper and broader. In many countries, financial intermediation is increasingly carried out directly in capital markets rather than through such traditional intermediaries as commercial banks. Moreover, complex linkages among global financial markets have increased capital mobility to the point where considerable amounts of funds cross national borders each day. These developments have potentially important implications for monetary policy in the United States and other countries. To explore the implications of these financial market trends, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City invited central bankers, academics, and financial market participants to a symposium entitled ""Changing Capital Markets: Implications for Monetary Policy."" The symposium was held August 19-21, 1993, at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This article highlights the issues raised at the symposium and summarizes the papers and commentary. The first section of the article provides an overview of the main issues and identifies areas of agreement and disagreement among program participants. The remaining sections summarize the viewpoints of the program participants and their policy recommendations SYMPOSIUM HIGHLIGHTS Over the past decade, two significant trends have emerged in financial markets around the world. First, there has been tremendous growth in domestic capital markets in terms of the volume and value of transactions and in the development of new types of securities. Associated with this growth in capital markets has been an apparent decline in the traditional role of commercial banks, as both depositors and borrowers have sought alternative sources for investment and financing. Second, in response to financial market liberalization around the world, international capital mobility has risen dramatically. Evidence of the significance of this trend can be found most strikingly in the recent turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) but is also apparent in the increased inflow of investment into Latin America and the volatility of Japan's overseas investment. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted in his introductory remarks at the symposium, both of these trends have important implications for monetary policy. If banks play a smaller role or a different role in the financial system, the monetary transmission mechanism may be altered. If so, monetary policy could become less effective or the impact of policy on economic activity may be different than in the past. In addition, it may become more difficult to implement monetary policy. These financial market changes may distort the information provided by traditional policy indicators such as the monetary aggregates. And, the greater capital mobility resulting from increased linkages among financial markets may make it more difficult for central banks to balance domestic policy considerations against international obligations. Finally, both trends have implications for financial stability. Regardless of whether they tend to enhance or diminish the inherent stability of the financial system, these changes in financial markets may complicate the task of central banks in assessing and controlling systemic risk and in responding to financial crises. Symposium participants debated the significance of these trends and, in the course of their discussion, reached broad agreement on a range of issues. Most participants felt financial market changes have altered the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy but have not impaired the overall ability of central banks to affect economic activity. At the same time, however, there was general agreement these changes have caused operational difficulties for monetary policy by reducing the usefulness of monetary aggregates and by making it more difficult to operate a fixed exchange rate system.",1993,1993-10-01,0,Econometric Reviews,,Monetary policy; Capital market; Systemic risk; Economics; Financial market; Financial market participants; Fixed exchange-rate system; Domestic policy; Monetary economics; Financial intermediary,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/fipfedker/y_3a1993_3ai_3aqiv_3ap_3a13-25_3an_3av.78no.4.htm,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/fipfedker/y_3a1993_3ai_3aqiv_3ap_3a13-25_3an_3av.78no.4.htm https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedker/y1993iqivp13-25nv.78no.4.html https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-395143/changing-capital-markets-implications-for-monetary,lens,005-776-506-679-867

Radiologists and vascular surgeons independently assessed index lesions on arteriograms to decide whether their respective treatments were appropriate. Of 263 male patients randomized, 255 received vascular intervention (surgery, 126 patients PTA, 129 patients). The groups were comparable when stratified for systemic risk factors and anatomic distribution of disease. Because eligibility criteria required that all lesions randomized for treatment be suitable for PTA, the severity of disease was less than that of the general population having vascular disease. Claudication was the principal indication for intervention. The immediate failure rate for PTA was 15.5% (20 of 129 patients). Surgery was performed with one in-hospital death (0.8%) and 17 complications (13.5%). There were two late deaths ascribable to surgical complications and none to PTA. At 4.5 years, 50 deaths (20%) (28 from surgery 22 with PTA) and 24 major amputations of legs included in the study (13 with surgery 11 with PTA) have occurred. The baseline ankle-brachial indexes (ABIs) of 0.51 0.01 for surgery and 0.50 0.02 for PTA increased by 0.32 0.02 and 0.28 0.02, respectively, after treatment and was not different between the groups through 36 months (surgery, 0.28 0.04 PTA, 0.30 0.05).

Everpresent are the operational risks of a computer hardware or software malfunction, such as the one that recently occurred at the Bank of New York and led to a $22.6 billion Discount Window loan, the largest in the history of the Federal Reserve. There are also risks of fraud from bank employees and customers some of these risks are covered by private insurance. Then there are the standard credit risks banks take on a daily basis when they allow customers to use uncollected or provisionally credited balances prior to settlement. Lastly, there is systemic risk which, at present, is borne by the public.

We have developed a microcomputer-based data handling system for evaluating vascular patients that is inexpensive ($6000 to $8000), easy to use, and flexible. Its simplicity for nonprogrammers is achieved through a natural interface with menu-driven operations and descriptive English language messages. With this system eight data entry forms were designed, and data on more than 1000 patients treated for peripheral vascular disease over the lastyears were entered into the computer by clerical personnel with minimal training. A query language report generator allowed us to obtain reports of in simple English on any set of selection criteria with all relevant statistical functions, including cumulative life-table patency rates. This system has the following advantages: rapid evaluation of data from several retrospective and prospective studies, such as comparison of graft material, effect of local and systemic risk factors, cost of limb-salvage surgery, and correlation of noninvasive laboratory tests with other parameters more accurate patient follow-up, with elimination of many of the pitfalls involved in observing large groups of patients frequently and quantitation of individual surgeon or service for quality control and self-review, which guide the vascular surgeon to modify treatment protocols, patient selection, and or surgical techniques.

"Wang, B.",An investigation into systemic risks and its mitigation based on complex network and agent-based modelling,"Significant events, such as crises created by breakdowns of financial systems, natural hazards, failures of the infrastructure systems, production shortfalls within supply chains create enormous amount of losses to affected communities, whose impact is not only confined to a single country or economic sector but more. Their statistics on social and economic damages are sobering and urge us to a better understanding of the systems we live in, identifying the sources and drivers of systemic risks, and finding measures to mitigate crises. To make a contribution toward this goal we present two projects using agent-based models. In the first project, we simulate a dynamical supply chain network and investigate whether diversification within the supply chain can help mid-level firms survive prolonged financial crises. To do so, we analyze the lifetime distribution of undiversified and diversified firms and compare the average lifetimes and the rates at which the midsections and tails of the cumulative lifetime distribution decay. We have found that the main benefit of diversification does not lie in increasing profits or lower operating costs, but helps mid-level firms more effectively manage the systemic risks they are exposed to, and help them survive longer in a competitive and uncertain business world. In the second project we are particularly interested to investigate the interbank market in Singapore. To do that we develop a numerical scheme that allows us to reconstruct the Singaporean interbank network structure based on day-to-day data of interbank borrowing and lending recorded by the Monetary Authorities of Singapore. We then simulate an interbank network, where banks are connected via interbank loans and invest into individually optimized portfolios comprising of one risky and one risk-free asset. This allows us to investigate the systemic risk introduced by leverage and interbank loans. To understand the effectiveness of regulations on bank liquidity and leverage introduced by Basel III, we compare the lifetime of bank for three different regulation scenarios: (1) unregulated leverage (2) penalized leverage and (3) forbidden leverage. We observe that, although banks in our model have complete market information they do not perform well due to highly leveraged investments. In addition we investigate the consequences of incomplete or wrong market information. We identify that the over- and underestimation of probabilities for successful risky investments has similar severe consequences with a sharp drop in lifetimes. Our show that a maximum in lifetimes is reached when regulations completely forbid leverage. Additionally we find that interbank lendings have a stabilizing effect on the network. This can be concluded since the reduction of linkages between banks reduces the lifetime of banks. On the other hand, if the network size and therefore the number of linkages per bank are increased we observe increased interbank lending accompanied by longer lifetimes.DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (SPMS",0,,0,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Engineering; Systemic risk; Complex network; Management science,http://dx.doi.org/10.32657/10356/64810,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/64810/1/BIN_WANG_2014.pdf https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/64810,lens,010-164-934-142-007
"Engle, R.F.; Moshirian, F.; Sahgal, S.; Zhang, B.",Banks non-interest income and global financial stability,"Depositary institutions over the last 15 years have increased the share of non-traditional revenue in total income.While the change in business models is a global phenomenon, it is more pronounced in countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K. In this study, we examine whether market structure can help explain the cross-country variation in the diversification activities that bank choose to pursue. The UK Independent Commission of Banking raised issues related to ring fencing retail banking from investment banking. The EU’s Liikanen Review and the Dodd-Frank Act in the US proposed policies which may limit trading and proprietary activities of large banks. It is important to understand the motivation behind these choices because non-traditional banking activities have shouldered a large part of the blame for the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and now face the brunt of regulatory efforts. Using a sample of large banks across 38 countries this paper examines how the concentration of the banking system impacts the choice of business activities and consequently the stability of banks. We show that banks in less concentrated banking systemssuch as in the US and Japan) have higher levels of non-traditional business activities with higher shareholder returns, but at a cost of increased systemic risk. In contrast, the non-traditional business activities in highly concentrated banking systems help reduce the volatility of profits and also increase banks stability. Unlike previous research we show that there is not always a one-to-one relationship between non-traditional business activities and global banks stability",0,,13,Social Science Research Network,,Finance; Shareholder; Net interest income; Business; Systemic risk; Investment banking; Retail banking; Revenue; Financial crisis; Business model; Financial system,http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/50/58225bc9e1ac2,https://apo.org.au/node/65891 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443181 https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2014-04/apo-nid65891.pdf https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2443181,lens,000-937-981-793-434

This risk occurs due to the deregulation implemented from 1980 by the so-called neoliberalism as well as due to the development of both the media and IT which have globally interconnected economic activity. The devastating effects of neoliberalism could only be restrained through state intervention, with the injection of great amounts of public money into private economic activity. In this context, this practice brought up the discussion on the actual regulatory role of the state in economy. In the current scenario of the development of contemporary capitalist society, there is often an actual separation between the interests of the real owner of the company (who is absent or passive) and the board of hired managers of the company. This fact generates the need for increased reliability and transparency in the calculation and statements of businessThe concept of good corporate governance practices is thus generated, which has compliance as one of its supporting pillars. Compliance works as a testing and validating structure of managerial functioning, correctness and reliability, thus, preventing risks that are inherent to business activity. In this scenario, the concept of regulated or forced self-regulation of economic activity was created. By this concept, the state goes beyond the previous position of merely repressing identified deviations, which meant that the organization could regulate itself. Now the state imposes an agenda of organizational duties, which need to be fulfilled and implemented to prevent risks of unethical or even criminal behavior. The role of criminal law, which has had a more modest scope than expected, ends up gaining importance because it acts as reinforcement rule for the protection of organizational duties and self-inspection of economic activity. The means chosen to achieve these goals are the use of criminal types of abstract danger, which may be either omissive or comissive by omission incrimination of private corruption enactment of extraterritorial laws that provide for collaboration among States in combating crime adoption of legal systems in the administrative scope that are criminal in their essence the increased acceptance and use of the criminal liability of legal entities. Starting from criminological findings and political-criminal propositions, this thesis aims at proposing the creation of a criminal imputation system of legal entities, based on the idea of a fact itself that can be considered as liable. The guilt is attached to the concept of organization defect in order to overcome the deficit in the implementation of the model adopted by Law No. 9.605 1998, which has not established any criteria to specify the scope of corporate actions that may be considered as liable to penalty for law offence. Therefore, we researched experiences and examples in foreign legal models (Italian, Chilean and Spanish legal models) that could help to propose criteria that lead to a new model adapted to the Brazilian reality, in which we aim, on the one hand, to maximize the possibilities of this new legal model, and, on the other hand, reach penal guarantees as widely as possible",0,,1,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/t.2.2015.tde-07122015-163555,https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/2/2136/tde-07122015-163555/publico/Leandro_Sarcedo_Tese_Versao_final.pdf https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/2/2136/tde-07122015-163555/pt-br.php,lens,008-847-864-736-74X

Another issue followed by this study is to compare conditional estimates of the CoVaR model of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) with the unconditional ones for the sixteen stock used by Almeida et al. (2012) unconditionally estimates. The show low and not statistically significant correlation with Almeida 's estimates. For the sample used here, comparing the conditional and the unconditional methodologies suggests a great similarity for the stress test, but not so close for the systemic risk",0,,0,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/d.12.2013.tde-20022014-153352,https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/12/12138/tde-20022014-153352/ https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/12/12138/tde-20022014-153352/publico/ThiagoBassoAlexandrino.pdf,lens,004-537-939-490-547

"Torres, V.L.",Using experimental game theory to measure cooperative relations in elementary school classrooms to understand its relationship with academic performance and school climate,"Cooperation has been key to our success as a species. Cooperative behavior on multiple levels and the structures that emerge from those interactions have been extending over different domains and scopes, from small food-sharing networks among hunter-gatherers to global trade and the generation and diffusion of knowledge and technology worldwide. Groups and societies have been creating and changing increasingly complex social mechanisms and institutions to allow, promote, and support cooperation and its scaling. All these efforts have boosted and expanded the benefits of cooperation but also have increased our interdependence between different actors, which also implies higher systemic risks. Cooperative Networks in small groups are the essential building blocks to sustain and promote large-scale cooperation. Moreover, large-scale cooperation is possibly our best chance to face today’s most significant global challenges and threats, such as climate change and global pandemics. Schools are crucial for human development. Here, we first face peers and learn how to cooperate with strangers. The school’s main goals are socialization, the transmission of culture, and teaching knowledge and skills. Classrooms, in many ways, have a similar tribe-like structure and a nested and controlled general situation, so dynamic cooperative networks emerge and mutate. Two main challenges for schools nowadays are about learning and well-being. In specific, how can we improve learning and achievement And, how can we make school a safer, bullying-free place Cooperative learning literature has consistently found that creating more cooperative learning environments has causal effects on increased academic achievement and decreased bullying behavior. However, no precise mechanism is known. So, our main research question over this work is the following: How cooperative networks in the classroom relate with other educational outcomes, particularly Academic Achievement and Bullying Behavior But, how can we measure cooperation in the class, and elicit these networks We propose that we can use experimental Game Theory, specifically implementing in the field an adaptation of a lab game-theoretic social dilemma, which try to reproduce with ecological similarities the tension between individual interests and social efficiency that students face in real life everyday interactions in the classroom. The essential concept is External Validity. We expect that the student’s behavior in the game will reflect their day-to-day behavior and classroom structure. The dyadic social dilemma we implement is a modified version of the Prisoner’s dilemma. A major adjustment is that in this game, students are aware of the partner’s identity that has been matched to them each round, i.e., the game is non-anonymous. Thereby, their choices when playing again each other are not only the result of intrinsic prosocial dispositions (or their absence), but also the result of their history and the perceptions they have about each other. In the first chapter, our first draft paper tackles the relationship between cooperative network topology and academic performance. We measured the cooperative centrality of students by quantifying their deviations from the average level of reciprocal cooperation in each interaction and found that students that engaged in high levels of reciprocal cooperation have significantly higher GPAs. In the second chapter, our second draft paper characterized the relationship between cooperative network topology and bullying subtypes. We categorized students on their bullying involvement in four different social categories: bully, bully-victim, victim, and non-involved students. Then, we use the data from the experiment combined with a self-report instrument and using multilevel modeling, we study how bullies, victims and bully-victims differ in their access to the elicited cooperative network. We found that bully victims and victims tend to receive less tokens than non-involved students. Both articles have important policy implications to the extent that they can inform the design of interventions in the early phases of education to improve both academic achievement and social coexistence",0,,0,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.52611/11447/6151,,lens,005-274-072-303-60X
