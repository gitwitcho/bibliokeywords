"Fiori, A.M.; Porro, F.",A compositional analysis of systemic risk in european financial institutions,"Systemic risk is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that needs to be addressed from different perspectives. In this work we propose a Compositional Data (CoDa) approach to analyze the distribution of relative contributions to systemic risk associated with major European countries during the period 2008 2021. We represent systemic risk measures corresponding to those countries as percentage shares, or parts, of a compositional dataset and we perform a multivariate statistical analysis using specific CoDa procedures. The proposed approach sheds new light on some variability patterns and cross-country relationships that appear to be linked to the composition of systemic risk parts in the system.",2023,2023-04-18,0,Annals of Finance,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Fiori, A.M.

"Müller, F.M.; Santos, S.S.; Righi, M.B.",A description of the COVID-19 outbreak role in financial risk forecasting,"This study aims to describe the risk of the system composed on the market indexes of the countries that were more affected by COVID-19. Our sample encompasses the thirty-five countries with more cases and or deaths caused by COVID-19 until November 2020. As a second contribution, we describe the risk of each market index individually. As a general pattern, we note that losses and individual and systemic risks peaked in March 2020. We verify that countries that were epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced critical levels of risk, which is partially explained by more stringent confinement measures since these are the ones whose labor markets will suffer more in the medium and long run. We perceived a market recovery, arguably due to the low-interest rates and expansive actions taken by central banks. Nonetheless, we also observed that the systemic risk returned to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2020.",2023,2023-03-04,0,the North American Journal of Economics and Finance,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Müller, F.M.

"Dri, E.; Aita, A.; Giusto, E.; Ricossa, D.; Corbelletto, D.; Montrucchio, B.; Ugoccioni, R.",A more general quantum credit risk analysis framework,"Credit risk analysis (CRA) quantum algorithms aim at providing a quadratic speedup over classical analogous methods. Despite this, experts in the business domain have identified significant limitations in the existing approaches. Thus, we proposed a new variant of the CRA quantum algorithm to address these limitations. In particular, we improved the risk model for each asset in a portfolio by enabling it to consider multiple systemic risk factors, resulting in a more realistic and complex model for each asset’s default probability. Additionally, we increased the flexibility of the loss-given-default input by removing the constraint of using only integer values, enabling the use of real data from the financial sector to establish fair benchmarking protocols. Furthermore, all proposed enhancements were tested both through classical simulation of quantum hardware and, for this new version of our work, also using QPUs from IBM Quantum Experience in order to provide a baseline for future research. Our proposed variant of the CRA quantum algorithm addresses the significant limitations of the current approach and highlights an increased cost in terms of circuit depth and width. In addition, it provides a path to a substantially more realistic software solution. Indeed, as quantum technology progresses, the proposed improvements will enable meaningful scales and useful for the financial sector.",2023,2023-03-31,0,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Dri, E.

The concept of ""too connected to fail"" suggests that network connectedness plays an important role in measuring systemic risk. In this paper, we first recover a time series of Bayesian networks for stock returns, which allow the direction of links among stock returns to be formed with Markov properties in directed graphs. We rank the stocks in the time series of Bayesian networks based on the topological orders of the stocks in the learned Bayesian networks and develop an order distance, a new measure with which to assess the changes in the topological orders of the stocks. In an empirical study using stock data from the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we use the order distance to predict the extreme absolute return, which is a proxy of extreme market risks, or a signal of systemic risks, using the LASSO regression model. Our indicate that the network statistics of the time series of Bayesian networks and the order distance substantially improve the predictability of extreme absolute returns and provide insights into the assessment of systemic risk.",2023,2023-01-20,0,Plos One,"advance directives; bayes theorem; hong kong; models, economic; time factors","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Chan, L.S.H.

The study aims to investigate the predisposing factors, clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of culture-proven cases of Actinomycotic primary canaliculitis. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective, interventional case series. Culture-proven cases of Actinomyces-associated primary canaliculitis diagnosed and treated between January 2017 and December 2021 at the Beijing Tongren Eye Center, Capital Medical University were identified and reviewed for ocular and systemic risk factors, clinical presentations, microbiological profile, treatment modalities and outcomes.Of the 201 patients diagnosed with primary canaliculitis, 22 (10.9%) were caused by Actinomyces. The mean age at onset of 22 patients (21 women and one men) was 54 years. The lower canaliculus was most commonly involved (54.6%). The most frequent symptom was mattering without epiphora (77.3%) and clinical signs were punctal regurgitation of purulent discharge (100%) and expressible concretions (95.5%). Dry eye co-existed in 77.3% of patients, whereas no obvious systemic factors were found. Among 19 cases (86.0%) of identified Actinomyces species, A. odontolyticus (43.5%) was the predominant causative microorganism. There were 50% of patients with polymicrobial infection and the most common additional bacteria isolated were Streptococcus species. Conservative therapy combining repeated canalicular expression and irrigation with susceptible topical antibiotics achieved complete resolution in 86.4% of patients.Dry eye was identified in the vast majority of patients with Actinomycotic canaliculitis. Most cases are odontogenic in origin and the infection occurs in immunocompetent individuals.

This study aimed to compare and analyze systemic and serum risk factors for nAMD and PCV in an aging Chinese population.MethodsA retrospective study was performed on 108 patients with nAMD, 131 patients with PCV, and 219 control subjects. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein(APOB), complement(C3), and complement(C4) together with data on systemic risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and asthma, were collected. Chi-square tests, independent-samplestests, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of risk factors with nAMD and PCV.Patients with PCV and those with nAMD were likely to have hyperlipidemia (P 0.05), DM was associated with PCV development (OR 0.535,0.044). Regarding serum risk factors, HDL, LDL, TG, APOB, and C3 were significantly associated with nAMD (OR 0.05).ConclusionOur findings indicate that hyperlipidemia is significantly associated with both nAMD and PCV.

Traditionally, PAD refers to diseases of the arteries outside of the coronary circulation, including carotid, visceral and lower extremity peripheral artery disease, and the heterogeneity of PAD patients is represented by different atherothrombotic pathophysiology, clinical features and related antithrombotic strategies. The risk in this diverse population includes systemic risk of cardiovascular events as well as risk related to the diseased territory (e.g., artery to artery embolic stroke for patients with carotid disease, lower extremity artery to artery embolism and atherothrombosis in patients with lower extremity disease). Moreover, until the last decade, clinical data on antithrombotic management of PAD patients have been drawn from subanalyses of randomized clinical trials addressing patients affected by coronary artery disease. The high prevalence and related poor prognosis in PAD patients highlight the pivotal role of tailored antithrombotic therapy in patients affected by cerebrovascular, aortic and lower extremity peripheral artery disease. Thus, the proper assessment of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk in patients with PAD represents a key clinical challenge that must be met to permit the optimal antithrombotic prescription for the various clinical settings in daily practice.

We aimed to determine the associations of inflammatory, metabolic, malnutrition, and frailty indexes with multimorbidity onset and progression and their predictions of multimorbidity-associated mortality risk. METHODS: A prospective cohort study (Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study SLASof 5,089 community-dwelling older adults aged 55 years in two waves of recruitment (SLAS-1: March 2005-September 2007, SLAS-2: January 2013-August 2018). Baseline variables included inflammatory (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR)) and metabolic profiles (atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), triglyceride-glucose index of insulin resistance (TyG)), physical frailty, and nutritional risk (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), Nutritional Screening Initiative (NSI), Elderly Nutritional Indicators for Geriatric Malnutrition Assessment (ENIGMA)). At follow-up, 3-5 years after the baseline interview, incident multimorbidity2 chronic diseases) was determined among multimorbidity-free participants (N 1,657) and worsening multimorbidity (increase of chronic diseases) among participants with baseline multimorbidity (N 1,207). Mortality in all participants and those with multimorbidity (N 2,291) was determined up to 31 December, 2016. Odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated in multivariate logistic and Cox regression models, in base model adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity, housing type, smoking, and a number of comorbidities, and further stepwise selection adjustment for other systemic risk indexes.At baseline, NLR, LMR, AIP, TyG, physical frailty, ENIGMA, NSI, and MNA-SF were significantly associated with prevalent multimorbidity (p 0.001). Among multimorbidity-free participants, LMR, TyG, and ENIGMA were significantly associated with incident multimorbidity in both the base model and further stepwise selection models: LMR (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.94), TyG (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.06-1.75), and ENIGMA (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.30). Among participants with baseline multimorbidity, NLR, LMR, and TyG significantly predicted worsened multimorbidity at follow-up in base model analysis, and LMR (OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86) and TyG (OR 1.96, 95% CI: 1.24-3.09) remained as independent predictors in further stepwise selection models. Among participants with prevalent multimorbidity, NLR, TyG, frailty, MNA, and ENIGMA were significantly associated with mortality risk with base model adjustments and further stepwise selection models: NLR (HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10-1.32), TyG (HR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.54), frailty (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.10-1.36), ENIGMA (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.22), MNA (HR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97). A combined systemic risk index shows increasing quartiles, adjusted for age, sex, housing, and smoking status, significantly predicting mortality risk. DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: The onset and progression of multimorbidity and its mortality impact are driven by systemic factors, including inflammation, metabolic dysfunction (insulin resistance), malnutrition, and frailty. The measurement of these systemic factors using simple, inexpensive clinical and blood chemistry tools can help in strategies to prevent and reduce its mortality impact.",2023,2023-01-06,1,Gerontology,aged; aging; chronic disease; frailty; geriatric assessment; humans; incidence; insulin resistance; malnutrition; multimorbidity; nutrition assessment; nutritional status; prospective studies; singapore,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Cheong, C.Y.

"Mao, X.; Wei, P.; Ren, X.",Climate risk and financial systems: A nonlinear network connectedness analysis,"To deeply analyze and understand the macro-financial impact of climate change, this paper investigates the effect of climate risk on systemic financial risks by employing a network approach. The demonstrate that climate risk not only affects a single financial market but also induces risk co-movement, which aggravates potential systemic financial risks. Specifically, the system-wide connectedness across the financial system respectively increased by 2.52% and 1.76% after the withdrawal of the US from the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen UN Climate Change Conference. The bond and stock markets are the primary transmitters of climate shocks, while the forex and commodity markets appear to be more sensitive to climate-related information. In addition, the vulnerability of financial asset price fluctuations to climate risk changes substantially over time. Quantile regressions reveal the positive impact of climate risk on total connectedness across the financial system.

Conversion strategies are intended to transform one or multiple supply chain functions for a different one to manage the changing environment. Supply chain disruptions due to natural hazards have been researched in key manufacturing-based economies like Thailand, the US, Japan, and China. Limited studies, however, have looked at the nature of interconnected risks and its effective countermeasures that arise when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt supply chains. Here, we examine systemic risks by contrasting supply chain disruptions caused by natural hazards and the pandemic. Our study investigates whether businesses can manage systemic risks brought on by the pandemic by learning from dealing with disruptions caused by natural hazards. We offer a typology of conversion strategies to demonstrate how conversion strategies can be a successful response to pandemic scenarios. Specifically, we propose six conversion types: production location, production line, storage, usage, distributional channel, and workforce skill set. Then, we conclude with the future research directions as well as the kinds of policy supports required to assist businesses in implementing conversion measures by drawing on prior work addressing natural hazards.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Progress in Disaster Science,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","Haraguchi, M.

We hypothesized that Marshallese households were experiencing high rates of food insecurity due to socioeconomic and systemic risk factors. Seventy-one Marshallese adults shared socioeconomic information about their household via an online survey. Descriptive indicate that 91% of respondents report food insecurity. In terms of systemic barriers, almost half of Marshallese respondents do not have health insurance. Additionally, while most respondents report feeling calm, peaceful, and energetic, paradoxically, 81% report feeling depressed and downhearted at least some of the time. Logistic regression findings suggest that food insecurity is significantly related to education levels and household economic strain. These are analogous with national findings, whereby non-native households are more likely to experience higher levels of food insecurity, lower rates of education, and higher economic strain than native households. As a collective community, the Marshallese could benefit from culturally responsive individual and family systems approaches for improving educational, social, financial, and health opportunities through workforce development, household income and asset development, and food security initiatives.

"Magner, N.S.; Hardy, N.; Lavin, J.; Ferreira, T.",Forecasting commodity market synchronization with commodity currencies: A network-based approach,"This paper shows that some commodity currencies (from Chile, Iceland, Norway, South Africa, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) predict the synchronization of metals and energy commodities. This relationship links the present-value theory for exchange rates and its connection with commodity export economies’ fundamentals, where prospective commodity price fluctuations affect exchange rates. Predicting commodity market return synchronization is critical for dealing with systemic risk, market efficiency, and financial stability since synchronization reduces the benefits of diversification and increases the probability of contagion in financial markets during economic and financial crises. Using network methods coupled with in-sample and out-of-sample econometrics models, we find evidence that a fall in the return of commodity-currencies (dollar appreciation) predicts an increase in commodity market synchronization and, consequently, in commodity market systemic risk. This discovery is consistent with a transitive capacity phenomenon, suggesting that commodity currencies have a predictive ability over commodities that extend beyond the commodity bundle that a country produces. The latter behavior would be exacerbated by the high financialization of commodities and strong co-movement of commodity markets.

However, population-based evidence on the link between Lp(a) and subclinical arteriosclerosis is lacking. We assessed associations of Lp(a) concentrations with arteriosclerosis in multiple arteries. METHODS ANDFrom the population-based Rotterdam study, 2354 participants (mean age: 69.5 years, 52.3% women) underwent non-contrast computed tomography to assess arterial calcification as a hallmark of arteriosclerosis. We quantified the volume of coronary artery calcification (CAC), aortic arch calcification (AAC), extracranial (ECAC), and intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC). All participants underwent blood sampling, from which plasma Lp(a) concentrations were derived. The association of plasma Lp(a) levels was assessed with calcification volumes and with severe calcification (upper quartile of calcification volume) using sex-stratified multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Higher Lp(a) levels were associated with larger ln-transformed volumes of CAC fully adjusted beta 95% confidence interval (CI) perstandard deviation (SD) in women: 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.14, men: 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.14AAC (women: 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.11, men: 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.14), ECAC (women: 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.13, men: 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.14), and ICAC (women: 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.14, men: 0.05, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.11In the highest Lp(a) percentile, severe ICAC was most prevalent in women fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.41, 95% CI 1.25-4.63 and severe AAC in men (fully adjusted OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.67-6.49). CONCLUSION: Higher Lp(a) was consistently associated with a larger calcification burden in all major arteries. The findings of this study indicate that Lp(a) is a systemic risk factor for arteriosclerosis and thus potentially an effective target for treatment. Lp(a)-reducing therapies may reduce the burden from arteriosclerotic events throughout the arterial system. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: In 2354 participants from the Rotterdam study, we assessed the link between Lp(a) concentrations and arterial calcifications, as proxy for arteriosclerosis, in major arteries. We found that higher Lp(a) levels were consistently associated with larger volumes of calcification in the coronary arteries, aortic arch, extracranial carotid arteries, and intracranial carotid arteries. The findings of our study indicate that Lp(a) is a systemic risk factor for arteriosclerosis, suggesting that the systemic burden of arteriosclerosis throughout the arterial system could be reduced by targeting Lp(a).",2023,2023-04-21,0,European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Singh, S.S.

"Natsagdorj, N.",Macroprudential policy to manage systemic risk deriving from financial institutions in mongolia,"This study presents a measurement model of systemic risk in the frontier market that fully employs financial statement data. The Financial Times Stock Exchange survey notes that frontier markets exist in more than 150 countries. The sum of systemic risk in the frontier markets can hinder economic stability in terms of a herd of risk. Frontier markets are likely to imply unpredicted systemic risk if we think based on previous lessons learned from being unable to foresee the early signals of the Lehman Brothers shock. The reasons for the rarely studied systemic risk in these markets might be that the markets are systemically unimportant, and there is a lack of publicly available data access. Therefore,gave it my best shot to capture systemic risk in the frontier market entirely using financial statement data. It is sometimes said that the frontier market is systemically not important because of its small size however, the research argued that the interconnection between financial institutions is highly likely to raise systemic risk even if it is small. The fact is the majority of financial institutions in developed, emerging, and frontier markets are deeply interconnected with each other via a network. For instance, the financial market in Mongolia is representative of frontier markets. As a financial regulatory aspect, financial conglomerates are increasing and deepening their interconnection in bank-dominated and underdeveloped capital markets. Hence, the intuition is to capture the systemic uncertainty behind increasing conspiracies in financial conglomerates to negatively impact financial stability. To accomplish this, the methodology measures financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk can be computed by the systemic expected shortfall. The systemic expected shortfall would be dependent on the marginal expected shortfall and can be explained by financial leverage and liabilities as the predicting power increases. Moreover, financial statements are situational mirrors of financial institutions. Based on these assumptions, we empirically measured the time and cross-dimensions of systemic risk using financial statement data. Potential variables from financial statements were tested to identify variables that could forecast systemic risk. Stock returns and capital market data have been frequently experimented with in previous literature, and financial statement data of frontier markets are new for systemic risk measurement. As a result of the analysis, the systemic expected shortfall could explain cross-dimension systemic risk, which is financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Subsequently, the time series of the marginal expected shortfall can forecast the amount of systemic risk in the next two periods. Eventually, macroprudential policy, a policy tool for systemic risk, can be easily developed after forecasting financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk.",2023,2023-02-12,0,New Frontiers in Regional Science: Asian Perspectives,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Natsagdorj, N.

"Aboussalah, A.M.; Chi, C.; Lee, C.",Quantum computing reduces systemic risk in financial networks,"In highly connected financial networks, the failure of a single institution can cascade into additional bank failures. This systemic risk can be mitigated by adjusting the loans, holding shares, and other liabilities connecting institutions in a way that prevents cascading of failures. We are approaching the systemic risk problem by attempting to optimize the connections between the institutions. In order to provide a more realistic simulation environment, we have incorporated nonlinear discontinuous losses in the value of the banks. To address scalability challenges, we have developed a two-stage algorithm where the networks are partitioned into modules of highly interconnected banks and then the modules are individually optimized. We developed a new algorithms for classical and quantum partitioning for directed and weighed graphs (first stage) and a new methodology for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming problems with constraints for the systemic risk context (second stage). We compare classical and quantum algorithms for the partitioning problem. Experimental demonstrate that our two-stage optimization with quantum partitioning is more resilient to financial shocks, delays the cascade failure phase transition, and reduces the total number of failures at convergence under systemic risks with reduced time complexity.",2023,2023-03-09,0,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware","Aboussalah, A.M.

The pandemic has formed a colossal disruption in supply chain networks. It has caused piling higher mortality in patients with comorbidities and generated a surging demand for critical care equipment, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and cutting-edge technologies. Personal protective equipment, masks, ventilators, testing kits, and even commodities required for daily care have been scarce as lockdown and social distancing guidelines have kicked in. Amidst COVID-19, implementing and executing key processes of the healthcare supply chain (HSC) in a secured, trusted, effective, universally manageable, and the traceable way is perplexing owing to the fragile nature of the HSC, which is susceptible to redundant efforts and systemic risks that can lead to adverse impacts on consumer health and safety. Though the crisis shone a harsh light on the cracks and weaknesses of the HSC, it brings some significant insights into how HSC can be made more resilient and how healthcare industries figure out solutions to mitigate disruptions. While there are innumerable experiences learned from the disruption of this crisis, in this paper, five important areas to analyze the most vital and immediate HSC enhancements including building a resilient supply chain, thinking localization, implementing reliable reverse logistics, breaking down extant silos to achieve end-to-end visibility, and redesigning HSC using digitalization are emphasized. This work identifies important features related to CoT and HSC. Also, this study links these lessons to a potential solution through Chain of Things (CoT) technology. CoT technology provides a better way to monitor HSC products by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain networks. However, such an integrated solution should not only focus on the required features and aspects but also on the correlation among different features. The major of this study is to reveal the influence path of CoT on smart HSC development. Hence, this study exploits (i) fuzzy set theory to eliminate redundant and unrelated features (ii) the Decision-Making and Experimental Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to handle the intricate correlation among different features. This fuzzy-DEMATEL (F-DEMATEL) model attempts to direct CoT technology towards smart HSC by identifying the most influencing factors and investors are recommended to contribute to the development of application systems. This work also demonstrates how CoT can act a vital role in handling the HSC issues triggered by the pandemic now and in the post-COVID-19 world. Also, this work proposes different CoT design patterns for increasing opportunities in the HSC network and applied them as imperative solutions for major challenges related to traditional HSC networks.",2023,2023-01-13,0,Socio-economic Planning Sciences,,33 Built Environment and Design; 3304 Urban and Regional Planning; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics,"Sathiya, V.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling residents using a validated self-assessment as part of comprehensive health screening. Methods: The data were derived from comprehensive health screening (PORI75) for older adults of 75 years living in Western Finland in 2020 and 2021. One of 30 validated measures in health screening focused on identifying medication-related risk factors (LOTTA Checklist). The Checklist items were divided into (1) systemic risk factors (10 items) and (2) potentially drug-induced symptoms (10 items). Polypharmacy was categorized according to the number of used drugs: (1) no polypharmacy5 drugs), (2) polypharmacy5 and 10), and (3) excessive polypharmacy10). The linearity across these three polypharmacy groups was evaluated using the Cochran-Armitage test.Altogether, 1024 out of 1094 residents who participated in the health screening consented to this study (n 569 in 2020 and459 in 2021). The mean number of all drugs in use was 7.0 (range 0-26 SD 4.1), with 71% of the residents using drugs, that is, having polypharmacy. Of the systemic risk factors most common was that the resident had more than one physician responsible for the treatment (48% of the residents), followed by missing drug list (43%), missing regular monitoring (35%), and unclear durations of the medication (35%). The most experienced potentially drug-induced symptoms were self-reported constipation (21%), urinating problems (20%), and unusual tiredness (17%). An increasing number of drugs in use, particularly excessive polypharmacy, was associated with various medication-related risk factors. Conclusion: As a part of comprehensive health screening the LOTTA Checklist provides useful information to prevent medication-related risk factors in home-dwelling older adults.

We argue that digital massification phenomena largely escape societal awareness due to their protracted evolution and are therefore still in the blind spot of long-term governance. Our analysis makes methodological use of historical and relational analogy, and we introduce and elaborate concepts and terms that allow us to discuss the evolutionary nature of massification, that is, the foreseeable increasing probability of the occurrence of trigger events. Using the analogy to the history of road traffic congestion, we deduce that digital massification will most likely lead to a future ""risk transition"" where tolerated disturbances and inconveniences of the present will turn into systemic impacts.

The onset of a systemic crisis is triggered by a large exogenous shock to banks’ balance sheets. Their behavioural response is modelled by a cascade mechanism that tracks the propagation of damaging shocks and possible amplification of the crisis, and leads the system to a cascade equilibrium. The mathematical properties of the stochastic framework are investigated for the first time in a generalization of the Eisenberg Noe solvency cascade mechanism that accounts for fractional bankruptcy charges. New include verification of a tree independent cascade property of the solvency cascade mechanism, and culminate in an explicit recursive stochastic solvency cascade mapping conjectured to hold in the limit as the number of banksgoes to infinity. It is shown how this cascade mapping can be computed numerically, leading to a rich picture of the systemic crisis as it evolves toward the cascade equilibrium.",2023,2023-01-10,0,Mathematics and Financial Economics,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Hurd, T.R.

"Zhu, B.; Hu, X.; Deng, Y.; Lin, R.",Systemic risk prevention policies targeting systemically important banks: does clustering pattern matter,"It is well known that strengthening the soundness of individual banks that are too large or too interconnected is essential for maintaining financial stability. The clustering among homogeneous banks may also cause financial fragility but has received less attention. This paper discusses the policy improvement for preventing systemic risk from the perspective of the clustering pattern of systemically important banks (SIBs) based on a network optimization model. The show that the clustering pattern of SIBs is closely related to systemic risk contagion. Remarkably, networks with fewer connections among SIBs exhibit lower systemic risk than those featuring apparent clustering of SIBs. The potential mechanism is that the systemic vulnerability of small and medium-sized banks is greatly reduced in the disassortative networks. The proposed tools based on this-inter-SIBs exposure limits and pairwise capital requirements-can guide network optimization and significantly reduce systemic risk. Furthermore, combining existing capital surcharges for SIBs (focusing on the stability of individual SIBs) and proposed network-based tools (focusing on the cluster structure of the network) will be an effective way to enhance financial stability over existing policies.",2023,2023-04-27,0,Plos One,cluster analysis,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","Zhu, B.

UACR and triglyceride (TRIG) were significantly correlated with FAZ area (all0.017). In multivariate analyses, PLT, eGFR, and APOB were independent risk factors for retinal rarefaction, and UACR was a significant predictor of FAZ area. Conclusion: We found several systemic risk factors, such as PLT, renal function and lipid profiles were associated with PD, VD, and FAZ area among Chinese T2DM patients.",2023,2023-03-13,0,Frontiers in Medicine,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Li, Y.

"Nistor, S.; Ongena, S.",The impact of policy interventions on systemic risk across banks,"What is the impact of policy interventions on the systemic risk of banks To answer this question, we analyze a comprehensive sample that combines an original set of bank-specific bailout events with the balance sheets of key affected and nonaffected European banks between 2005 and 2014. We find a positive and significant association of guarantees with systemic risk that is somewhat weaker in the long run when the regulator appoints members to the supervisory board. The short run association between recapitalizations and systemic risk is also positive for large and less capitalized banks, while in the long run, recapitalizations are linked with reduced systemic importance, especially for less profitable banks and in cases when the regulator limits management pay. Liquidity injections are positively linked with systemic risk, but the long-run effect is mitigated for small or better capitalized banks. In the short run, injecting liquidity is associated with reduced systemic risk when the regulator imposes restrictions on supervisory board composition or on management pay or capital payouts.",2023,2023-02-22,0,Journal of Financial Services Research,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Nistor, S.

"Zhou, M.; Yu, Y.; Chen, R.; Liu, X.; Hu, Y.; Ma, Z.; Gao, L.; Jian, W.; Wang, L.",Wall shear stress and its role in atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is the major form of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in countries around the world. Atherosclerosis combines the interactions of systemic risk factors, haemodynamic factors, and biological factors, in which biomechanical and biochemical cues strongly regulate the process of atherosclerosis. The development of atherosclerosis is directly related to hemodynamic disorders and is the most important parameter in the biomechanics of atherosclerosis. The complex blood flow in arteries forms rich WSS vectorial features, including the newly proposed WSS topological skeleton to identify and classify the WSS fixed points and manifolds in complex vascular geometries. The onset of plaque usually occurs in the low WSS area, and the plaque development alters the local WSS topography. low WSS promotes atherosclerosis, while high WSS prevents atherosclerosis. Upon further progression of plaques, high WSS is associated with the formation of vulnerable plaque phenotype. Different types of shear stress can lead to focal differences in plaque composition and to spatial variations in the susceptibility to plaque rupture, atherosclerosis progression and thrombus formation. WSS can potentially gain insight into the initial lesions of AS and the vulnerable phenotype that gradually develops over time. The characteristics of WSS are studied through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. With the continuous improvement of computer performance-cost ratio, WSS as one of the effective parameters for early diagnosis of atherosclerosis has become a reality and will be worth actively promoting in clinical practice. The research on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis based on WSS is gradually an academic consensus. This article will comprehensively review the systemic risk factors, hemodynamics and biological factors involved in the formation of atherosclerosis, and combine the application of CFD in hemodynamics, focusing on the mechanism of WSS and the complex interactions between WSS and plaque biological factors. It is expected to lay a foundation for revealing the pathophysiological mechanisms related to abnormal WSS in the progression and transformation of human atherosclerotic plaques.",2023,2023-04-03,0,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Zhou, M.

"Liu, Q.; Xu, M.; Xiong, J.",Will a boom be followed by crash A new systemic risk measure based on right-tail risk,"In this study, we demonstrate that high short-term gains on the A-share market may lead to significant losses in the future and potentially cause a market catastrophe. To study the accumulation, outbreak, and cross-sector spillover process of systemic risk in the Chinese stock market, we define right-tail risk as a large rally process that may lead to left-tail losses in the future and construct a tail volatility spillover network by distinguishing between left-tail and right-tail risk. In the risk accumulation process, the market expectation bias of common shocks considerably magnifies heterogeneity risk, and in the risk outbreak and spillover processes, the greatest systemically important and systemically susceptible sectors are banking and information technology, respectively. In addition, the level of risk spillover is extremely sensitive to tail shocks and increases as tail shocks intensify. Moreover, right-tail risk has more forward-looking predictive power for left-tail risk. Apart from achieving immediate regulatory s, Chinese authorities must consider market expectation bias when implementing rules. Additionally, authorities want to be wary of right-tail risk, which has the potential to create serious and pervasive damage in the future if the market is allowed to be unregulated during short-term spikes.",2023,2023-02-01,0,Frontiers in Psychology,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,"Liu, Q.

"Peters, F.; Neuberger, D.; Reinhardt, O.; Uhrmacher, A.",A basic macroeconomic agent-based model for analyzing monetary regime shifts,"In macroeconomics, an emerging discussion of alternative monetary systems addresses the dimensions of systemic risk in advanced financial systems. Monetary regime changes with the aim of achieving a more sustainable financial system have already been discussed in several European parliaments and were the subject of a referendum in Switzerland. However, their effectiveness and efficacy concerning macro-financial stability are not well-known. This paper defines the economic requirements for modeling the current monetary system and introduces the corresponding macroeconomic agent-based model (MABM) in a continuous-time stochastic agent-based simulation environment with a provenance model. This MABM aims to present a starting point for exploring and analyzing monetary reforms. In this context, the monetary system affects the lending potential of banks and might impact the dynamics of financial crises. MABMs are predestined to replicate emergent financial crisis dynamics, analyze institutional changes within a financial system, and thus measure macro-financial stability. The used simulation environment makes the model more accessible and facilitates exploring the impact of different hypotheses and mechanisms in a less complex way. Moreover, the model replicates a wide range of stylized economic facts, which validates it as an analysis tool to implement and compare monetary regime shifts.",2022,2022-12-22,0,Plos One,computer simulation; health facilities; switzerland,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory","Peters, F.

"Banai, Á.; Berlinger, E.; Dömötör, B.",Adjustable-rate mortgages in the era of global reflation: how to model additional default risk,"We investigate the problem of interest rate risk transforming into default risk of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the EU. Bank regulation is strikingly not neutral in this aspect, it explicitly favors short-duration adjustable-rate loans over long-duration fixed-rate loans in the framework of the gap management. This asymmetry in the regulation creates perverse incentives both for banks and households, which can lead to aggressive risk-taking, over-indebtedness of unhedged households, high procyclicality of mortgage markets, and increased systemic risks. We present a stress test model to quantify potential losses stemming from this specific risk from the perspective of lender institutions. We estimate the average extra capital that is needed to cover the additional risk of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in the EU to be 0.53% of the value of the total mortgage portfolio and 1.97% of the value of the adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio.

"Petrone, D.; Rodosthenous, N.; Latora, V.",An AI approach for managing financial systemic risk via bank bailouts by taxpayers,"Bank bailouts are controversial governmental decisions, putting taxpayers’ money at risk to avoid a domino effect through the network of claims between financial institutions. Yet very few studies address quantitatively the convenience of government investments in failing banks from the taxpayers’ standpoint. We propose a dynamic financial network framework incorporating bailout decisions as a Markov Decision Process and an artificial intelligence technique that learns the optimal bailout actions to minimise the expected taxpayers’ losses. Considering the European global systemically important institutions, we find that bailout decisions become optimal only if the taxpayers’ stakes exceed some critical level, endogenously determined by all financial network’s characteristics. The convenience to intervene increases with the network’s distress, taxpayers’ stakes, bank bilateral credit exposures and crisis duration. Moreover, the government should optimally keep bailing-out banks that received previous investments, creating moral hazard for rescued banks that could increase their risk-taking, reckoning on government intervention.",2022,2022-11-17,1,Nature Communications,artificial intelligence; government; markov chains,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Petrone, D.

"Liu, C.; Lu, Q.; Zhang, Q.",An empirical study of the effect of a flooding event caused by extreme rainfall on preventive behaviors against COVID-19,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, wearing masks, vaccinations, and maintaining a safe distance has become social behaviors advocated by the government and widely adopted by the public. At the same time, unpredictable natural disaster risks brought by extreme climate change compound difficulties during epidemics and cause systemic risks that influence the existing pattern of epidemic prevention. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the effect of natural disaster risk caused by climate change on the response to outbreaks in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. This study will focus on individual-level epidemic prevention behaviors, taking as an example the significant risk of severe destructive flooding caused by heavy rains in Henan, China, on July 20, 2021, which claimed 398 lives, to explore the effect of floods on the preventive behaviors of residents in the hardest hit areas against COVID-19. Through the multi-stage stratified random sampling of the affected residents in Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Hebi, Luoyang, Anyang, and other cities in Henan Province, 2,744 affected people were surveyed via questionnaires. Through the linear regression model and moderating effect analysis, the study found that after floods, the individual's flood risk perception and response behaviors significantly correlated with the individual's prevention behaviors against COVID-19. Specifically, both flood risk perception and response behaviors strengthened the individual's prevention behaviors. Furthermore, the study also found that community risk preparation behavior and social capital can moderate the above relationship to a certain extent.

This study aimed to estimate salivary and serum levels of Omentin-1 in chronic periodontitis with or without diabetes mellitus before and after scaling and root planing (SRP) and also the level of glycemic control. Materials and methods: Based on history and clinical parameters, 70 subjects were allocated into two groups i.e. chronic periodontitis (Group 1) and chronic periodontitis with well controlled T2DM (Group 2). Baseline saliva and serum samples were collected from both groups followed by full mouth SRP. Subjects were recalledmonths post SRP for salivary and serum sample collection and measurement of clinical parameters. Serum as well as salivary samples collected were further analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the Omentin-1 concentration in each sample.The levels of Omentin-1 in saliva and serum were significantly lower in both the groups at baseline. Clinical parameters exhibited a significant reductionmonths post SRP in both groups. Salivary and serum Omentin-1 levels significantly increased in both the groups,months post SRP.

Following the insult, the visual development varies from minor to severe deterioration. The aim of this study was to examine possible prognostic systemic risk factors and their eventual impact on post-insult visual development in NAION patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all NAION patients (18-79 years at time of diagnosis) seen a minimum of two times in a tertiary eye department during a 10-year period in regard to systemic diseases, medication, lifestyle factors and ophthalmic examination was performed. Visual outcome was assessed according to the development of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and visual field from initial to final visit.There were 163 eligible patients. A greater proportion of the patients in the total cohort were over 50 years of age (79.8%) and men (66.3%). In total, 59.5% of the patients had a stable BCVA, while 25.8% experienced improvement, and 14.7% had deterioration. Seventy-two percent of the patients had a stable visual field, while 14% had improvement, and 14% had deterioration. No association between visual outcome and clinical characteristics, medication or systemic risk factors were identified. Conclusion: We did not find any association between patient characteristics and systemic risk factors at time of diagnosis and visual development post-insult.

"Bahers, J.; Singh, S.; Durand, M.",Analyzing socio-metabolic vulnerability: evidence from the comoros archipelago,"Small island developing states are often characterized as vulnerable owing to their unique geographies of smallness and remoteness, resource insecurity, and more recently from the impacts of climate change. These vulnerabilities are often manifested in resource insecurity, significant imports, poor waste management, and the inability to develop economies of scale. In effect, sustaining small islands in an era of global environmental change is a task both scholars and policy makers are increasingly grappling with. Can small islands be sustainable This research examines the social metabolism of an island system, and introduces the concept of socio-metabolic vulnerabilityAs such, this research provides novel insights into the linkages between patterns of resource-use, systemic risks and vulnerability. from a local material and energy flow analysis (local-MEFA) for the island of Ndzuwani (Comoros) suggest a very low level of resource-use but at the same time heavy reliance on critical imports that cover vast distances, that are vulnerable to price and climate shocks. Informal activities in resource extraction play an important role in lending both vulnerability and resilience to Ndzuwani. This study adds to the scarce body of literature that argues that small island economies would need to leverage resource-use patterns to build system resilience, along with bold policies and institutions that support material circularity, engage communities and fosters frugal innovation.",2022,2022-03-21,4,Anthropocene Science,,41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,"Bahers, J.

This study looks at the global and Vietnamese stock markets impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to identify systemic emergencies. Risk dependent value (CoVaR) and Delta link VaR are two important tail-related risk indicators used in Conditional Bivariate Dynamic Correlation (DCC) (CoVaR). The empirical findings demonstrate that when COVID-19's worldwide spread widens, the volatility transmission of systemic risks across the global stock market and multiple exchanges shifts and becomes more relevant over time. At the time of COVID-19, the world industrial market was larger than the Vietnamese stock market, and the Vietnamese stock market posed a lesser danger to the global market. A closer examination of the link between the Vietnam value-at-risk (VaR) range index sample and the world stock index indicates a significant degree of downside risk integration in key monetary systems, particularly during the COVID-19 era. Our study findings may help regulators, politicians, and portfolio risk managers in Vietnam and worldwide during the unique moment of uncertainty created by the COVID-19 epidemic.",2022,2022-01-06,34,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,covid-19; humans; investments; pandemics; uncertainty; vietnam,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Moslehpour, M.

"So, M.K.P.; Mak, A.S.W.; Chu, A.M.Y.",Assessing systemic risk in financial markets using dynamic topic networks,"Systemic risk in financial markets refers to the breakdown of a financial system due to global events, catastrophes, or extreme incidents, leading to huge financial instability and losses. This study proposes a dynamic topic network (DTN) approach that combines topic modelling and network analysis to assess systemic risk in financial markets. We make use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to semantically analyse news articles, and the extracted topics then serve as input to construct topic similarity networks over time. Our indicate how connected the topics are so that we can correlate any abnormal behaviours with volatility in the financial markets. With the 2015 2016 stock market selloff and COVID-19 as use cases, our also suggest that the proposed DTN approach can provide an indication of (a) abnormal movement in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and (b) when the market would gradually begin to recover from such an event. From a practical risk management point of view, this analysis can be carried out on a daily basis when new data come in so that we can make use of the calculated metrics to predict real-time systemic risk in financial markets.",2022,2022-02-17,4,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","So, M.K.P.

"Bhoot, M.; Pegu, J.; Bhumbla, S.; Dubey, S.; Agarwal, M.; Mukherjee, S.; Harish, H.S.",Association of primary angle-closure disease in patients with retinal vein occlusion in north indian population,"Purpose: To determine the association of primary angle-closure disease (PACD) in patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) at a tertiary eye care center in North India. Methods: It is a cross-sectional, observational study. Sixty consecutive patients with retinal vein occlusion within a period of one year from a single tertiary eye care center were enrolled. Detailed history, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, intraocular pressure measurement by applanation tonometry, gonioscopy and fundus examination were done. Anterior chamber depth and axial length were also measured.Among the 60 patients, 29 were males (48.3%) and 31 females (51.6%). Twenty-seven (45%) of them had central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and 33 (55%) had branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Forty percent of patients with RVO had PACD. Relative risk of PACD was 1.71 times in patients with CRVO as compared to BRVO. Risk of glaucoma was 49% more in CRVO than BRVO. Probability of PACD was more in patients of RVO who had diabetes and CAD as comorbidity. Conclusion: The association between PACD and RVO is less known. PACD can be one of the risk factors for the development of RVO. A comprehensive examination and detailed angle evaluation of both of the eyes should be done in all cases of RVO, in addition to investigating for systemic risk factors. However, larger population-based studies would be required to prove it as an independent risk factor.",2022,2022-07-29,0,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,cross-sectional studies; female; fundus oculi; glaucoma; gonioscopy; humans; male; retinal vein occlusion,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Bhoot, M.

Whether baseline retinal nonperfusion assessment is additionally predictive of DR disease worsening is unclear.To assess whether the extent and location of retinal nonperfusion identified on UWF-FA are associated with worsening in Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (DRSS) score or DR treatment over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal observational study with data for 508 eyes with nonproliferative DR and gradable nonperfusion on UWF-FA at baseline. All images were graded at a centralized reading center 200 ultra-widefield (UWF) color images were graded for DR at baseline and annually foryears. Baseline 200 UWF-FA images were graded for nonperfused area, nonperfusion index (NPI), and presence of predominantly peripheral lesions on UWF-FA (FA PPL). Interventions: Treatment of DR or diabetic macular edema was at investigator discretion. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association of baseline UWF-FA nonperfusion extent with disease worsening, defined as eitheror more steps of DRSS worsening within Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study fields on UWF-color images or receipt of DR treatment.After adjusting for baseline DRSS, the risk of disease worsening overyears was higher in eyes with greater overall NPI (hazard ratio HR for 0.1-unit increase, 1.11 95% CI, 1.02-1.21 .02) and NPI within the posterior pole (HR for 0.1-unit increase, 1.35 95% CI, 1.17-1.56 .001) and midperiphery (HR for 0.1-unit increase, 1.08 95% CI, 1.00-1.16 .04). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for baseline DRSS score and baseline systemic risk factors, greater NPI (HR, 1.11 95% CI, 1.02-1.22 .02) and presence of FA PPL (HR, 1.89 95% CI, 1.35-2.65 .001) remained associated with disease worsening. and Relevance: This 4-year longitudinal study has demonstrated that both greater baseline retinal nonperfusion and FA PPL on UWF-FA are associated with higher risk of disease worsening, even after adjusting for baseline DRSS score and known systemic risk. These associations between disease worsening and retinal nonperfusion and FA PPL support the increased use of UWF-FA to complement color fundus photography in future efforts for DR prognosis, clinical care, and research.",2022,2022-10-01,7,Jama Ophthalmology,cohort studies; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; fluorescein angiography; humans; longitudinal studies; macular edema; photography; prospective studies; retinal vessels,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Silva, P.S.

"Maslak, G.D.; Senel, G.",Bank consolidation and systemic risk:a during the 2008 financial crisis,"In this paper, we analyze the relationship between US bank consolidation and systemic risk before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis. We find that mergers during the crisis decreased market-adjusted systemic risk. This effect was more pronounced for mergers with smaller acquirers of larger targets. Meanwhile, mergers of larger banks increased the aggregate systemic risk. In the years following the crisis, we find that banks that merged during the crisis had lower return volatility and fewer nonperforming loans than non-merged banks. Comparing pre-and post-crisis mergers, we do not find a significant difference with respect to their effect on systemic risk.",2022,2022-03-10,0,Journal of Financial Services Research,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Maslak, G.D.

"Das, S.R.; Kalimipalli, M.; Nayak, S.","Banking networks, systemic risk, and the credit cycle in emerging markets","We study how globalization impacts systemic risk in emerging markets. We extend a large literature on systemic risk in the US, Europe, and other developed countries to emerging markets, which are relatively under-researched. Our findings are based on a large-scale empirical examination of systemic risk among 1048 financial institutions in a sample of 23 emerging markets, broken down intoregions, along with 369 U.S. financial institutions. Using an additively decomposable systemic risk score that combines banking system interconnectedness with default probabilities, systemic risk is quantified for each region, across time. The empirical analyses suggest that emerging markets’ systemic risk is heterogeneous across regions, is strongly dependent on the interconnectedness of the banking system within each region, and drives the level of default risk in each region, while the regions are compartmentalized away from each other and insulated from the United States. The systemic risk score may be used as a policy variable in each emerging market region to manage the credit cycle. Our evidence is consistent with the notion that globalization engenders financial stability and does not lead to large systemic risk spillovers across emerging market regions.",2022,2022-09-01,0,Journal of International Financial Markets Institutions and Money,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Das, S.R.

"Luo, H.",Banking systemic risk estimating of china's banking industry during the COVID-19 pandemic based on complex network theory,"The spread of COVID-19 worldwide has led to significant fluctuations in the global financial market, and the banking industry has also been exposed to the dual impact of the real economy and the financial market. In this paper, Chinese bank networks in different COVID-19 periods were constructed using CoVaR model and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and the characteristics and risk changes of the proposed bank networks were analyzed based on complex network theory. Additionally, the index of complex network theory was combined with the non-performing loan ratio of banks to build a new index for evaluating and measuring the systemic risk of banks in different periods. It was found that the network density, clustering coefficient and average network strength of banking networks increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the level of inter-bank correlation, and the systemic risk of banking networks increased. It was suggested after using the new indicators that joint-stock commercial banks and rural commercial banks were the main risk spillovers in different periods, and the systemic risk of these banks had increased during COVID-19. Therefore, the supervision of joint-stock commercial and rural commercial banks should be strengthened to prevent the risks from spreading to these banks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2022,2022-11-04,0,Heliyon,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Luo, H.

Here we look at how flexible work practices, allied with adequate supports and lifelong learning opportunities, aided economic recovery following the earlier crisis in order to see if there are any lessons to be learnt for post-pandemic recovery. Overall, the indicated that flexicurity provided a modest growth dividend during the Great Recession, typically no more than one percentage point. Of the individual components, the short-run indicated that security along with life-long learning and part-time work proved the most beneficial, although flexible work practices also boosted growth, albeit to a lesser extent.

The of the article is to confirm that the systemic nature of contagion risk is greater in extreme situations than in normal situations. Through this study we want to highlight the nature of contagion and the transmission of shocks in both the economic and financial spheres. Similarly, we have tried to measure the dynamics of contagion processes in normal situations and also those of crises. This work contributes to the current and recent debate on the risk of cross-border contagion and in particular in a health crisis. Using graph theory, information theory and Markov chains, we were able to verify that the systemic risk of contagion was significantly increased during the lockdown and that the commercial and financial dynamics changed during this period (between March 2020 and June 2020). Similarly, our state that the extreme degree of contagion risk is predictable via Markov chains by pre-emptively using medium-voltage cycles that are precursors of systemic crises.",2022,2022-04-06,4,Research in Globalization,,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4702 Cultural Studies","Louati, A.

METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent dilated ophthalmic examination and fundus photography. Conjunctival swabs were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR via a triple target assay. We assessed the relationships of retinopathy with clinical outcomes, systemic risk factors and laboratory data.The median age was 59.5 years and 29 (48%) were female. Retinopathy associated with COVID-19 was observed in 12 of 60 patients (20%). The median age of patients with COVID-19 retinopathy was 51.5 compared to 62.5 years in individuals without retinopathy (p 0.01). Median BMI was 34.3 in patients with retinopathy versus 30.9 in those without retinopathy (p 0.04). Fifteen of 60 patients (25%) tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive in their tear film without a relationship with timing of illness and hospitalization. The N2 gene was particularly sensitive with 18 of 19 eyes (94.7%) showing N2-positivity, includingpatients with alpha variant-positivity (B.1.1.7). CONCLUSION: Retinopathy was observed in 20% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Patients with retinopathy were more likely to be younger and have higher BMI than hospitalized patients without retinopathy. Tear film SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 25% of patients.

We adapt the working capital framework of successful US companies like Amazon and Walmart and model an innovative Murabaha facility as trade credit within the real sector of the economy. We then test its robustness in a range of simulation tests. Our approach is novel and stands in contrast to the familiar financial sector fixed-income facilities, characteristic of Western economies, stealthily mimicked as mark-up (interest rate based) Murabaha by Islamic banks. We argue that this is neither appropriate nor effective for Islamic economies, making them fragile under monetary pressures in crises like the current coronavirus and energy ones. Our simulation indicate that the trade credit Murabaha not only transforms debt into a risk-sharing one but also offers more competitive financing rates, reduces systemic risk, and improves financial stability. Furthermore, our imply that the trade credit Murabaha can increase the efficiency of Islamic financial systems and make them more resilient to shocks. Consequently, this paper discusses the integration of our novel Murabaha within a recreated architecture of Universal Banking. As an implication, this should promote business activity and contribute to global growth. Finally, we recommend how to deploy our novel Murabaha based on trade credit (as opposed to the currently deployed fixed-income-mimicked Murabaha) to alleviate twin agency debt costs (risk shifting, underinvestment) and solve the ownership transfer problem of modern Islamic banking.",2022,2022-09-15,1,Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Jatmiko, W.

The analysis is aimed at providing key recommendations for policymakers to improve national-level preparedness for anticipated pandemic threats. This chapter has drawn on a review of secondary literature and primary data gathered through in-depth interviews conducted with key informants in the disaster management and public health sectors in the country. Findings show that while preparedness planning for biological hazards is predominantly a responsibility of the health sector in the country, there is a pressing need to strengthen such preparedness through a unified legal framework and system of governance that allow for the transfer of relevant expertise, infrastructure, and lessons learned from previous hazards contexts to situations of pandemics the incorporation of pandemic preparedness into national-level DRR efforts and subnational-level DRR planning intensifying national focus on building economic and social resilience emulating a multisectoral approach, enhancing private sector participation, and establishing a national framework to foster preparedness for parallel hazards.",2022,2022-06-17,0,,,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 48 Law and Legal Studies,"Fernando, N.

Observations: A 39-year-old woman with the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection for two weeks presented with a nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in her right eye. The patient was on low-dose aspirin for anticoagulant prophylaxis (100 mg day) for a week when the CRVO occurred. She had no history of any systemic risk factors for retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and her systemic evaluation failed to identify an etiology for her unilateral CRVO. While she was on monthly follow-up with no additional treatment, she experienced sudden visual acuity decrease in the same eye four months after the first RVO incident and one month after the cessation of aspirin intake. Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was decreased from 20 25 to 20 63. Her fundoscopic examination revealed increased intraretinal hemorrhages, dilated tortuous veins in the upper hemifield and macular edema. The central macular thickness measurement by optic coherence tomography was increased from 234 μm to 700 μm. The patient refused to undergo a fundus fluorescein angiography. After the diagnosis of the branch retinal vein occlusion with cystoid macular edema was done, the aspirin prophylaxis was restarted, and she received three intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor one month apart for her macular edema. Her BCVA improved to 20 20, and macular edema disappeared without any recurrence during the 6-month follow-up. and importance: To the best of our knowledge, this unique case is the first report of consecutive RVOs in the same eye of a healthy young patient associated with COVID-19.

"Chen, X.; Dong, Y.; Hunt, K.; Zhuang, J.",Counterterrorism resource allocation during a pandemic: the effects of dynamic target valuations when facing a strategic terrorist,"The outbreak of pandemics such as COVID-19 can result in cascading effects for global systemic risk. To combat an ongoing pandemic, governmental resources are largely allocated toward supporting the health of the public and economy. This shift in attention can lead to security vulnerabilities which are exploited by terrorists. In view of this, counterterrorism during a pandemic is of critical interest to the safety and well-being of the global society. Most notably, the population flows among potential targets are likely to change in conjunction with the trend of the health crisis, which leads to fluctuations in target valuations. In this situation, a new challenge for the defender is to optimally allocate his her resources among targets that have changing valuations, where his her intention is to minimize the expected losses from potential terrorist attacks. In order to deal with this challenge, in this paper, we first develop a defender-attacker game in sequential form, where the target valuations can change as a result of the pandemic. Then we analyze the effects of a pandemic on counterterrorism resource allocation from the perspective of dynamic target valuations. Finally, we provide some examples to display the theoreticaland present a case study to illustrate the usability of our proposed model during a pandemic.",2022,2022-07-15,1,Risk Analysis,,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,"Chen, X.

"Igan, D.; Mirzaei, A.; Moore, T.",Does macroprudential policy alleviate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the resilience of banks,"This paper examines the resilience of banks as perceived by market participants during the COVID-19 crisis. We analyse how bank stock returns during January-March 2020 relate to the pre-crisis activation of macroprudential policy across 52 countries in a cross-sectional dimension. We find that, overall, a tighter macroprudential policy stance is beneficial for bank systemic risk, as assessed by equity market investors. A robust finding is that a perceived decrease in bank risk stems primarily from the use of credit growth limits, reserve requirements, and dynamic provisioning. By contrast, a pre-crisis build-up of capital surcharges on systemically important financial institutions seems to lower bank stock returns. Alternative bank risk indicators suggest that the latter is likely to be driven by concerns about profits rather than the probability of default.",2022,2022-02-01,7,Journal of Banking & Finance,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Igan, D.

Systemic risk is always negatively affected by oil-specific demand shocks but positively affected by oil supply shocks when the market is under medium and low systemic risk levels.

"Sahyoun, J.; Sabeti, S.; Robert, M.",Drug-induced corneal deposits: an up-to-date review,"This review assesses different clinical aspects of the various known drug-induced corneal deposits, based on the corneal layer involved (epithelium, stroma and or endothelium), and based on the drug class. The most well-known condition caused by drug deposits is vortex keratopathy, or corneal verticillata, which is a whorl-like opacity in the corneal epithelium. Vortex keratopathy is commonly caused by certain cationic amphiphilic drugs such as amiodarone, antimalarials, suramin, tamoxifen, chlorpromazine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These deposits usually occur once a certain dose of the drug is reached. Most cases present with mild to moderate symptoms with minimal visual impairment. Most of these deposits resolve automatically, after months to years of drug cessation. Notably, other drug classes can cause deposits in all three layers of the cornea. Chlorpromazine, gold, rifabutin, indomethacin and tyrosine kinase inhibitors can cause stromal deposits, with reduced visual acuity when the anterior stroma is involved. Chlorpromazine and rifabutin can also cause deposits in the endothelial layer of the cornea. Regardless of the type of corneal deposit, local therapies such as topical lubricants or corticosteroids may help improve symptoms. Drug cessation or modification can also be helpful but should be weighed against the systemic risks of the underlying disease.",2022,2022-03-25,1,Bmj Open Ophthalmology,"chlorpromazine; corneal dystrophies, hereditary; corneal opacity; humans; rifabutin; vision disorders",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Sahyoun, J.

"Fan, H.; Tang, M.",Dynamic banking systemic risk accumulation under multiple-risk exposures,"Much of the existing research on banking systemic risk focuses on static single-risk exposures, and there is a lack of research on multiple-risk exposures. The reality is that the banking system is facing an increasingly complex environment, and dynamic measures of multiple-risk integration are essential. To reveal the risk accumulation process under the multi-risk exposures of the banking system, this article constructs a dynamic banking system as the research object and combines geometric Brownian motion, the BSM model, and the maximum likelihood estimate method. This article also aims to incorporate three types of exposures (interbank lending market risk exposures, entity industry credit risk exposures, and market risk exposures) within the same framework for the first time and builds a model of the dynamic evolution of banking systemic risk under multiple exposures. This study included the collection of a large amount of real data on banks, entity industries, and market risk factors, and used the ΔCoVaR model to evaluate the systemic risk of the China banking system from the point of view of the accumulation of risk from different exposures, revealing the dynamic process of risk accumulation under the integration of multiple risks within the banking system, as well as the contribution of different exposures to banking systemic risk. The showed that the banking systemic risk of China first increased and then decreased with time, and the rate of risk accumulation is gradually slowing down. In terms of the impact of different kinds of exposures on system losses, the credit risk exposure of the entity industry had the greatest impact on the banking systemic risk among the three kinds of exposures. In terms of the contribution of the interbank lending market risk to the systemic risk, the Bank of Communications, China Everbright Bank, and Bank of Beijing contributed the most. In terms of the contribution of the bank-entity industry credit risk to the systemic risk, the financial industry, accommodation and catering industry, and manufacturing industry contributed the most. Considering the contribution of market risk to the systemic risk, the Shanghai Composite Index, the Hang Seng Composite Index, and the Dow Jones Index contributed the most.

AIM: To investigate the ECC experience including risk factors, incidence of caries, pain and infection as well as relapse rates of caries and secondary dental general anaesthesia (GA). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study included dental records of children with ECC, aged 72 months at an Australian public dental hospital paediatric dentistry department from 2013 to 2015 (n 102). Dental caries, pain, infection, referral patterns, demographic and caries risk factor data were recorded for 24 months. Descriptive statistics were used for patient characteristics and clinical data, and Kaplan-Meier curves and parametric exponential survival models for time-to-event series.The study population demonstrated higher-than-national average dmft and disease progression at baseline. Major risk factors for the development of caries, pain and infection were daily consumption of sweetened beverages, poor oral hygiene, residing in lower socio-economic areas, older age and being male. Rates of caries relapse and new referral for secondary treatment under general anaesthesia were relatively high.

Stress testing has emerged as one of the most prevalent regulatory tools for addressing climate-related financial risks, and this article analyzes the role of stress testing in mitigating the effects of climate change on financial stability. Specifically, it synthesizes the multi-disciplinary literature on climate-related financial risk, financial stability, and stress testing to develop a framework for evaluating the capacity and effectiveness of stress tests for measuring and managing climate-related systemic financial risk. It then takes stock of climate stress testing proposals and early practices globally and applies the evaluative framework in comparative case studies of the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve. It concludes that stress testing can support the measurement and management of both microprudential and macroprudential climate-related financial risks, but the benefits of stress testing vis- -vis climate change and financial stability are largely unrealized. Addressing the disconnect between climate stress testing policy motivation and implementation as well as the divergence between leading and lagging jurisdictions will require both interagency and international regulatory cooperation.",2022,2022-11-28,0,Journal of Banking Regulation,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","DeMenno, M.B.

"Kress, J.C.; McCoy, P.A.; Schwarcz, D.",Evolving approaches to systemic risk regulation in insurance,"After the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers developed two different approaches to systemic risk arising from insurance conglomerates and other nonbank financial firms. The first, dubbed an entity-based approach, empowers a public entity like the Financial Stability Board or Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate individual nonbank systemically important financial institutions for enhanced regulation and supervision. The second, known as an activities-based approach, seeks to regulate financial activities that can produce systemic risk. Updating the authors' previous work on nonbank systemic risk, this book chapter evaluates how policymakers' approaches to systemic risk regulation in insurance have evolved since the crisis. It tracks how international standard-setting organizations and U.S. regulators initially relied on the entity-based approach, using discretionary methodologies for identifying specific nonbank firms, including insurers, that were systemically significant. It then shows how, in response to backlash, international and U.S. policymakers abruptly ceased entity-based designations and purported to shift their focus to an activities-based approach to nonbank systemic risk. This chapter contends, however, that rumors of the demise of entity-based systemic risk regulation are premature. Instead, prevailing regulatory strategies for nonbank systemic risk retain strong elements of an entity-based approach, particularly in the insurance sector. The key change is that insurers subject to enhanced systemic risk regulation are no longer chosen using complex, multi-factor tests that require regulators to exercise significant discretion. Instead, regulators rely on more formulaic rules to identify insurers that could pose systemic risks and, at least in theory, regulate them accordingly. These developments demonstrate that an entity-based approach is an indispensable component of effective nonbank systemic risk regulation. Policymakers’ continued emphasis on entity-based strategies is sensible because effective systemic risk oversight requires consolidated regulation that focuses on the cumulative impact of a financial conglomerate’s activities. Activities-based approaches, meanwhile, are often difficult to implement outside of an entity-oriented regime. Thus, the much-heralded shift to activities-based systemic risk regulation in the insurance sector may prove in the long run to be mostly rhetorical. Entity-based systemic risk regulation in the insurance sector is here to stay. The principal remaining question is whether it will be designed and implemented effectively.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies","Kress, J.C.

"Kumar, P.; Singh, V.K.",Examining the time varying spillover dynamics of indian financial indictors from global and local economic uncertainty,"The research aims to excavate the role of global (Fed Rate, Crude, Real Dollar Index) and endogenous economic variables (GDP and Consumer Price Index) in shaping the spillover amongst the major Indian Financial indicators, viz. Nifty Index, MCX Gold, USDINR, Govt. Bond 10Y maturity and agricultural index N-Krishi. To facilitate cross-comparison decomposition of time-varying spillover output generated from Time-Varying Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) with aggregation at three layers is performed. The research finds that Indian Financial Indicators are vulnerable to spillover shocks from global variables predominantly driven by Fed Rate and Real Dollar Index. USDINR turns out to be most sensitive to global shocks and transgresses the shock to other financial indicators. Importantly, persistently high inflation has brought volatility spikes in the directional spillover to financial indicators. Though spillover subsidence is observed post-2014, with an all-time high during GFC, a sudden spurt in all financial indicators has been observed post-Covid-19, with Govt. bonds showing a sporadic rise. An important observation relates to staunch spillover from GDP during GFC with reoccurrence post-Covid. Additionally, a closely knit spillover tie is observed among USDINR, N-Krishi, and Crude. The study is beneficial to RBI to proactively monitor the weakening rupee along with Fed tapering to manage the rising spillover post-Covid-19.

This exploratory study uses multiple national child welfare and population data sources to identify macro level factors associated with short-stays. Two-level logistic regression modeling was conducted to explore how state-level factors were associated with risk of short-stays. Factors associated with lower odds of short-stays included living in a state with a centralized child welfare reporting structure and with greater food insecurity. Factors associated with greater odds included living in a state with a higher percentage of the state's population enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and states with more police per capita. Multiple state level factors were associated short-stay risk, which suggests broader systemic factors contribute to these brief removals. Findings suggest greater surveillance by police and social services increases risk of short-stays, which likely have implications for child welfare policy and practice.",2022,2022-05-27,0,Child Maltreatment,child; child welfare; home care services; humans; logistic models; united states,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4409 Social Work,"Greenfield, B.

The most frequent initial clinical manifestation was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (6 cases, 50.0%) followed by splenomegaly (3 cases, 25.0%). The most frequent systemic risk factor for EHPVT was presence of inherited prothrombotic disorder (10 cases, 83.3%), and the most common local risk factor for EHPVT was umbilical vein catheterization (5 cases, 41.7%). Esophageal varices were revealed in all the study participants, and in the most cases, they were grade 2. Propranolol was used as primary or secondary prophylaxis inchildren (58.3%), and inchildren (41.7%), a shunt was performed (Meso-Rex bypass inchildren and splenorenal shunt inchildren).

"Kanas, A.; Zervopoulos, P.D.",Federal home loan bank advances and systemic risk,"We explore the relationship between Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and systemic risk. In terms of theoretical framework, there exist two links which characterise this relationship. The first connection is from lagged systemic risk to subsequent advances, establishing the liquidity provision’ effect. The second is from lagged advances to subsequent systemic risk, establishing the moral hazard’ effect. We empirically explore which link prevails in the U.S. commercial banking sector, using a unified mixed frequency VAR econometric model. This approach is flexible enough to model quarterly advances and monthly systemic risk. We reveal robust evidence for the link from lagged systemic risk to subsequent advances, thereby supporting the liquidity effect. In addition, we show that this effect is a mechanism which alleviates any detrimental impact of systemic risk on real economic activity. The latter finding carries important policy implications, highlighting the role of FHLB advances in managing the effects of increasing systemic risk on the real economy.",2022,2022-07-30,0,Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Kanas, A.

This study uses financial distress as a moderating variable to examine the relationship between financial immunity and stock returns of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which have different characteristics. The research samples were companies listed on the Indonesia stock exchange and the Shanghai stock exchange with 767 and 736 observations, respectively, in 2016-2019. The first-stage test method uses balanced data panel regression to test individual interactions as a sufficient condition. Regression model specification of the response variable for the fixed effects model can overcome the common effects model limitations. The second stage is a matched test or Paired Samples T-Test for hypothesis testing after testing each individual interaction for each country. The of this study show that financial immunity has a positive effect on stock returns in two countries: Indonesia and China. Meanwhile, the financial distress of the US-China Trade War for Indonesia and Shanghai shows differentFinancial distress significantly reduces stock returns on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, while the distress does not affect stock returns on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Typically, because of the low concentration at which leachables occur in pharmaceuticals, irritation is of minimal concern therefore, this manuscript focuses on sensitization potential. The primary of performing a leachable sensitization assessment is protection against Type IV induction of sensitization, rather than prevention of an elicitation response, as it is not possible to account for the immunological state of every individual. Sensitizers have a wide range of potencies and those which induce sensitization upon exposure at a low concentration (i.e. strong, or extreme sensitizers) pose the highest risk to patients and should be the focus of the risk assessment. The Extractables and Leachables Safety Information Exchange (ELSIE) consortium has reviewed the status of dermal, respiratory, and systemic risk assessment in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, and proposes a framework to evaluate the safety of known or potential dermal sensitizers in pharmaceuticals. Due to the lack of specific regulatory guidance on this topic, the science-driven risk-based approach proposed by ELSIE encourages consistency in the toxicological assessment of extractables and leachables to maintain high product quality and ensure patient safety.",2022,2022-02-07,2,Critical Reviews in Toxicology,drug contamination; drug packaging; humans; pharmaceutical preparations; risk assessment,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology,"Parris, P.

"Heyvaert, V.",Governing intersystemic systemic risks: lessons from covid and climate change,"This article argues that contemporary regulation of climate change risks and zoonotic disease riskstwo seminal risks of our erais deficient because it fails to account for the most distinctive characteristics of their risk profiles. These risks are part of a special category of intersystemic systemic risks, which are 'compound' in nature: they possess the potential to cascade across different systems and entail a liability to exponential growth across numbers of linked systems. Moreover, climate change and zoonotic disease risks are globalised, ubiquitous and entrenched. Effective governance of intersystemic systemic risks demands proactive regulatory intervention at the early stages of risk creation, and reliance on a more balanced basket of regulatory measures than is currently available. For climate change as well as zoonotic disease risk control, this calls for greater investment in assessment requirements, a less permissive approach to planning and development consent, and a commitment to phase out unsustainable production processes.",2022,2022-03-04,1,Modern Law Review,,48 Law and Legal Studies,"Heyvaert, V.

"Turiel, J.D.; Aste, T.",Heterogeneous criticality in high frequency finance: A phase transition in flash crashes,"Flash crashes in financial markets have become increasingly important, attracting attention from financial regulators, market makers as well as from the media and the broader audience. Systemic risk and the propagation of shocks in financial markets is also a topic of great relevance that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In the present work, we bridge the gap between these two topics with an in-depth investigation of the systemic risk structure of co-crashes in high frequency trading. We find that large co-crashes are systemic in their nature and differ from small ones. We demonstrate that there is a phase transition between co-crashes of small and large sizes, where the former involves mostly illiquid stocks, while large and liquid stocks are the most represented and central in the latter. This suggests that systemic effects and shock propagation might be triggered by simultaneous withdrawals or movement of liquidity by HFTs, arbitrageurs and market makers with cross-asset exposures.",2022,2022-02-10,1,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Turiel, J.D.

We employed fixed-effect regression analysis to show that banks with overconfident CEOs increase the firm's systemic risk. The also confirm that powerful CEOs enhance the contribution of non-bank financial institutions to systemic risk, whereas CEO power's impact was significant only for non-state-owned banks.

"Bordo, M.D.; Duca, J.V.",How the new fed municipal bond facility capped municipal-treasury yield spreads in the covid-19 recession,"For over two centuries, the municipal (muni) bond market has been a source of systemic risk, which returned early in the Covid-19 downturn when borrowing from securities markets became costly for many private and public entities, and some found it difficult to borrow at all. Indeed, just before the Fed announced its unprecedented intervention into the muni market, spreads of muni over Treasury yields rose in line with the unemployment rate and appeared headed to levels not seen since the Great Depression, when real municipal gross investment plunged 35 percent below 1929 levels. To prevent such a calamity, the Fed created the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) to purchase newly issued, (near) investment-grade state and local government bonds at ratings-based interest rate spreads over the safe OIS benchmark yield. In general, these spreads were initially about 100 basis points above average spreads under more normal market conditions and were later lowered by 50 basis points in August 2020. Despite a modest take-up, our study documents the MLF prevented muni spreads from rising much above those margins (plus a modest 10 basis point fee) and limited the extent to which interest rate spreads could have amplified the impact of the Covid pandemic. To establish the MLF the Fed needed Treasury indemnification against default losses. There were concerns about whether the creation of the MLF could induce moral hazard among borrowers and could undermine the efficiency of the bond market if the facility had lasted too long. Partly for this reason and because the muni market had settled down by yearend 2020, the Treasury terminated the MLF at that time. Future assessments of these downside aspects will help answer the question whether the program's benefits addressed here exceeded its costs.",2022,2022-12-24,1,Journal of the Japanese and International Economies,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Bordo, M.D. (Rutgers University, National Bureau of Economic Research, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, United States.); Duca, J.V.

"Fan, H.; Zhao, Y.",Identification of systemically important banks in china based on merton-shapley model and a comparison between different indicators,"Accurately measuring systemic risk in the banking industry and identifying systemically important banks are significant parts of macro-prudential supervision. However, there is a lack of research on measuring systemic risk and identifying important banks under the same framework. And there are relatively few studies comparing different indicators of systemically important banks in the context of China's banking industry. Therefore, this paper first constructs a new Merton model to measure the dynamically evolving systemic risk of China's banking system. Then combine the Merton model with the Shapley value to construct the Merton-Shapley framework, and propose a new indicator MShv to identify systemically important banks. At last, use the data of China's banking industry from 2006 to 2019 to conduct an empirical study. The research show that the systemic risk in China peaked in 2008 and 2015 near the stock market crash, after 2008 the risk appeared a fluctuating decline. And it is found that MShv can accurately identify important banks and simultaneously is conducive to policy implementation. By a comparison between MShv and other systemic risk contribution indicators such as ΔCoVaR, MES, and SRISK, we find that there are many differences for different indicators in the applicability of identifying systemically important banks, the information reflected, and so on. Regulators can consider using several indicators synthetically to supervise banks during different risk periods, in order to maintain the stability of the financial system.",2022,2022-12-09,0,Heliyon,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Fan, H.

"Caferra, R.; Falcone, P.M.; Morone, A.; Morone, P.",Is COVID-19 anticipating the future evidence from investors’ sustainable orientation,"In this paper, we discuss the attractiveness of green and sustainable assets, from an investor perspective. Inspired by the current state of the art, with researchers positively (re)considering the added value of stocks associated with the fulfilment of sustainable development goals, we analyze whether such stocks demonstrated: (1) a different and (2) an outperforming dynamic during various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we examine sustainable-indexed assets and companies with a fully bio-based production system, against a counterfactual group of non-indexed activities operating in the same sectors. Asset connectivity is investigated by means of a correlation network, and portfolio optimization is applied to measure profitability. The show: (1) fewer connections between bio-based assets and the rest of the world, suggesting that, given their potential long-term resilience, investors might consider them capable of mitigating COVID-19 systemic risk, and therefore a valid investment to hold and (2) the effectiveness and profitability of bio-based assets in portfolios. Considering the latter finding, we document a switching effect after the hard lockdown phase, during which rational investors (seeking an optimal mean variance) may have inferred the efficacy of capital re-allocation from simply sustainable assets to bio-based companies. Here, we discuss the potential role of the pandemic as an accelerator of the sustainable green transition, considering the welfare implications in terms of socio-economic wellbeing and reduction of negative environmental externalities deriving from the conversion of the traditional production and management system.

Like COVID-19, climate change impacts, and maladaptive responses to them, have potential to disrupt societies at multiple scales via networks of trade, finance, mobility and communication, and to impact hardest on the most vulnerable. However, these complex systems can also facilitate resilience if managed effectively. This review aims to distil lessons related to the transboundary management of systemic risks from the COVID-19 experience, to inform climate change policy and resilience building. Evidence from diverse fields is synthesised to illustrate the nature of systemic risks and our evolving understanding of resilience. We describe research methods that aim to capture systemic complexity to inform better management practices and increase resilience to crises. Finally, we recommend specific, practical actions for improving transboundary climate risk management and resilience building. These include mapping the direct, cross-border and cross-sectoral impacts of potential climate extremes, adopting adaptive risk management strategies that embrace heterogenous decision-making and uncertainty, and taking a broader approach to resilience which elevates human wellbeing, including societal and ecological resilience.",2022,2022-01-11,12,Climate Risk Management,,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,"Ringsmuth, A.K.

"Gabrielle, P.",Lipid metabolism and retinal diseases,"PURPOSE: The retina has enormous lipids demands and must meet those needs. Retinal lipid homeostasis appears to be based on the symbiosis between neurons,ller glial cells (MGC), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, which can be impacted in several retinal diseases. The current research challenge is to better understand lipid-related mechanisms involved in retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.In a first axis, in vitro and focus onller glial cell, we aimed to characterize whether the 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), an overexpressed end-product of cholesterol elimination pathway in neural tissue and likely produced by suffering retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma, may modulate MGC membrane organization, such as lipid rafts, to trigger cellular signalling pathways related to retinal gliosis. We have found that lipid composition appears to be a key factor of membrane architecture, especially for lipid raft microdomain formation, in MGC. However, 24S-OHC did not appear to trigger retinal gliosis via the modulation of lipid or protein composition within lipid rafts microdomains. This study provided a better understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. On a second clinical ax, we focused on the lipid-related mechanisms involved in the dysfunction of aging RPE and the appearance of drusenoid deposits in AMD. Using the Montrachet population-based study, we intend to report the frequency of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and its ocular and systemic risk factors, particularly related to lipid metabolisms, such as plasma lipoprotein levels, carotenoids levels, and lipid-lowering drug intake. Our study showed that RPD was less common in subjects taking lipid-lowering drugs. Lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, may reduce the risk of RPD through their effect on the production and function of lipoproteins. This observation highlights the potential role of retinal lipid trafficking via lipoproteins between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium cells in RPD formation. Those findings have been complemented with preliminary on the analysis of plasma fatty acid (FA) profile, a surrogate marker of short-term dietary lipid intake, according to the type of predominant drusenoid deposit, soft drusen or RPD, in age-related maculopathy. CONCLUSION: Further research on lipid metabolism in retinal diseases is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology of retinal diseases and develop new promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools for our patients.",2022,2022-09-18,1,Acta Ophthalmologica,carotenoids; cholesterol; fatty acids; glaucoma; gliosis; humans; hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors; lipid metabolism; macular degeneration; retinal drusen,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Gabrielle, P.

An urban safety net hospital database was used for this cross-sectional observational study. Diabetic patients who underwent fundus photography and AL measurement between March 2017 and June 2020 were included. The fundus photographs were graded following the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. The study enrolled 1843 patients with diabetes (mean age: 56.9 12.1 years AL: 23.56 1.12 mm), including 931 men and 912 women. Male sex was a risk factor for diabetic retinopathy (P 0.001 odds ratio OR 1.5, 95% confidence interval CI 1.18 1.98). A higher DR prevalence was associated with shorter AL both in men (P 0.003 OR 0.77 95% CI 0.66 0.91) and women (P 0.02 OR 0.83 95% CI 0.71 0.97) after adjusting for systemic risk factors using multivariable logistic regression. There was no significant impact of sex on the relationship between AL and DR (P 0.56). In the subset of patients with asymmetric DR, the percentage of patients whose shorter eye had a higher stage of DR was not significantly different between men and women (P 0.20).

"Fratrič, P.; Sileno, G.; Klous, S.; van, E.T.",Manipulation of the bitcoin market: an agent-based study,"Fraudulent actions of a trader or a group of traders can cause substantial disturbance to the market, both directly influencing the price of an asset or indirectly by misinforming other market participants. Such behavior can be a source of systemic risk and increasing distrust for the market participants, consequences that call for viable countermeasures. Building on the foundations provided by the extant literature, this study aims to design an agent-based market model capable of reproducing the behavior of the Bitcoin market during the time of an alleged Bitcoin price manipulation that occurred between 2017 and early 2018. The model includes the mechanisms of a limit order book market and several agents associated with different trading strategies, including a fraudulent agent, initialized from empirical data and who performs market manipulation. The model is validated with respect to the Bitcoin price as well as the amount of Bitcoins obtained by the fraudulent agent and the traded volume. Simulation provide a satisfactory fit to historical data. Several price dips and volume anomalies are explained by the actions of the fraudulent trader, completing the known body of evidence extracted from blockchain activity. The model suggests that the presence of the fraudulent agent was essential to obtain Bitcoin price development in the given time period without this agent, it would have been very unlikely that the price had reached the heights as it did in late 2017. The insights gained from the model, especially the connection between liquidity and manipulation efficiency, unfold a discussion on how to prevent illicit behavior.",2022,2022-06-01,2,Financial Innovation,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Fratrič, P.

The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of these disasters as systemic risks. They involve from global and national processes related to social determinants that materialize in a complex system of dams distributed throughout the country with their intrinsic risks. When they occur, result in a set of impacts with potential damage and immediate effects combined with secondary and tertiary impacts that can trigger chain reactions, which promote risk factors of heterogeneous and complex occurrence. Approaching these events from the point of view of systemic risk allows for a broader understanding of both the singularity of each of these disasters and their multiple exposure, risk and disease processes, as well as the structural characteristics in which social, political processes and dynamics and economic factors reproduce in multiple territories a common pattern of disasters and their effects. We conclude that the promotion of population health and sustainable territories should guide the organization of production processes and not the opposite, with the externalization of human, environmental and social costs of mining and its disasters.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Revista Brasileira De Epidemiologia,brazil; disasters; humans,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,"de Freitas, C.M.

"Belval, E.J.; Bayham, J.; Thompson, M.P.; Dilliott, J.; Buchwald, A.G.",Modeling the systemic risks of COVID-19 on the wildland firefighting workforce,"Wildfire management in the US relies on a complex nationwide network of shared resources that are allocated based on regional need. While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for transmission of infectious diseases between fire sites. In this manuscript, we review a first attempt at building an epidemiological model adapted to the interconnected fire system, with the aims of supporting prevention and mitigation efforts along with understanding potential impacts to workforce capacity. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016 2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We used this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We found vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible, suggesting the recommended interventions could successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. As the model was built in 2021 before the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants, the modeled viral parameters and isolation quarantine policies may have less relevance to 2022, but nevertheless underscore the importance of following basic prevention and mitigation guidance. This work could set the foundation for future modeling efforts focused on mitigating spread of infectious disease at wildland fire incidents to manage both the health of fire personnel and system capacity.",2022,2022-05-18,0,Scientific Reports,covid-19; fires; humans; sars-cov-2; wildfires; workforce,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences","Belval, E.J.

"Anwer, Z.; Khan, A.; Naeem, M.A.; Tiwari, A.K.",Modelling systemic risk of energy and non-energy commodity markets during the COVID-19 pandemic,"COVID-19 led restrictions make it imperative to study how pandemic affects the systemic risk profile of global commodities network. Therefore, we investigate the systemic risk profile of global commodities network as represented by energy and nonenergy commodity markets (precious metals, industrial metals, and agriculture) in pre- and post-crisis period. We use neural network quantile regression approach of Keilbar and Wang (Empir Econ 62:1 26, 2021) using daily data for the period 01 January 2018 27 October 2021. The findings suggest that at the onset of COVID-19, the two firm-specific risk measures namely value at risk and conditional value of risk explode pointing to increasing systemic risk in COVID-19 period. The risk spillover network analysis reveals moderate to high lower tail connectedness of commodities within each sector and low tail connectedness of energy commodities with the other sectors for both pre- and post-COVID-19 periods. The Systemic Network Risk Index reveals an abrupt increase in systemic risk at the start of pandemic, followed by gradual stabilization. We rank commodities in terms of systemic fragility index and observe that in post COVID-19 period, gold, silver, copper, and zinc are the most fragile commodities while wheat and sugar are the least fragile commodities. We use Systemic Hazard Index to rank commodities with respect to their risk contribution to global commodities network. During post COVID-19 period, the energy commodities (except natural gas) contribute most to the systemic risk.

To prevent this impact, we require quantitative systemic risk management we can carry out using conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) and a network model. The former measures any targeted entity's tail risk conditional on another entity being financially distressed the latter represents the financial system through a set of nodes and a set of edges. In this study, we modify CoVaR along with its multivariate extension (MCoVaR) considering the joint conditioning events of multiple entities. We accomplish this by first employing a multivariate Johnson's SU risk model to capture the asymmetry and leptokurticity of the entities' asset returns. We then adopt the Cornish-Fisher expansion to account for the analytic higher-order conditional moments in modifying (M)CoVaR. In addition, we attempt to construct a conditional tail risk network. We identify its edges using a corresponding Delta (M)CoVaR reflecting the systemic risk contribution and further compute the strength and clustering coefficient of its nodes. When applying the financial system to global foreign exchange (forex) markets before and during COVID-19, we revealed that the resulting expanded (M)CoVaR forecast exhibited a better conditional coverage performance than its unexpanded version. Its superior performance appeared to be more evident over the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, our network analysis shows that advanced and emerging forex markets generally play roles as net transmitters and net receivers of systemic risk, respectively. The former (respectively, the latter) also possessed a high tendency to cluster with their neighbors in the network during (respectively, before) COVID-19.

Neither the resilience of these networks is known, nor do we have ways to systematically monitor their ongoing change. Systemic risk contributions of individual companies were hitherto not quantifiable since data on supply networks on the firm-level do not exist with the exception of a very few countries. Here we use telecommunication meta data to reconstruct nationwide firm-level supply networks in almost real-time. We find the probability of observing a supply-link, given the existence of a strong communication-link between two companies, to be about 90%. The so reconstructed supply networks allow us to reliably quantify the systemic risk of individual companies and thus obtain an estimate for a country’s economic resilience. We identify about 65 companies, from a broad range of company sizes and from 22 different industry sectors, that could potentially cause massive damages.

"Brown, I.; Berry, P.",National climate change risk assessments to inform adaptation policy priorities and environmental sustainability outcomes: a knowledge systems perspective,"National Climate Change Risk Assessments (CCRAs) have a key role in informing priorities for adaptation policy but face significant challenges due to multiple facets of risk and adaptation. Issues are especially pronounced for meeting goals of environmental sustainability due to the complex dynamics of socio-ecological systems. In practice, a CCRA can therefore differ from its original conceptual blueprint. These challenges are explored from a knowledge systems perspective, focusing on the role of stakeholders policymakers, risk descriptors, methods, evidence sources, and scientists. A UK case study evaluates recent developments (CCRA3) including identification of policy urgency through adaptation shortfalls and its application to the natural environment. Important science-policy issues are also highlighted regarding inclusion of opportunities, systemic risks, residual risks, and risk tolerance. A general conclusion is that CCRAs inevitably leave open questions which lead back to their evolving role in the science-policy interface. A knowledge systems perspective identifies CCRAs as open, adaptive, reflexive processes that help redefine interpretations of risk and adaptation, rather than just providing a specific policy-relevant product. This perspective identifies scope for progressive refinement of CCRAs to enhance collective science-policy adaptive capacity whilst also engaging wider society. For environmental sustainability, this open process can be used to iteratively redefine robust future pathways and system reference conditions that also better reflect evolving societal perceptions and tolerance on sustainability risk in the face of climate change.",2022,2022-12-21,0,Climatic Change,,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,"Brown, I.

The Bayley-III composite scores of patients with ROP treated with anti-VEGF were comparable to those of patients with ROP without treatment (cognitive:.491 language:.201 motor:.151) and premature patients without ROP (cognitive:.985 language:.452 motor:.169) after adjusting for confounders. Patients with ROP treated with laser photocoagulation exhibited poorer cognitive composite scores than did those without treatment (P .001), premature patients without ROP (P .001), and those treated with anti-VEGF (P .001), but they had similar language and motor composite scores.Intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment for ROP was not associated with adverse neurodevelopment in premature infants.

These oral lesions induced by target therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors are different from traditional lesions associated with chemo radiotherapy and they have not yet been correctly characterized. This paper aims to report retrospectively the oral immune-related adverse events caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: A table in electronic format was prepared and sent by e-mail to several clinical structures in order to collect, for each patient, anamnestic data, discretionary habits, systemic risk factors, the presence and number of comorbidities, and the characteristics of the oral lesions in the course of oncological therapy with anti-PD1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab). Following the collection of anamnestic and clinical data relating to patients treated with anti-PD1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and the detection of oral lesions, data analysis was carried out.A number of 364 patients treated with nivolumab (209) and pembrolizumab (155), administered intravenously at a therapeutic dose were selected. There have been cases of oral adverse effects in treated patients. The oral adverse effects found fell into the categories of stomatitis, xerostomia, candidiasis and taste disturbances. Analyzing the incidence of oral lesions in patients undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, there was no significant difference between the two drugs examined.Further studies are certainly needed to catalog, focus and identify in advance the adverse effects, including oral ones, in patients treated with ICI type PD1 PDL-1. It is necessary, for the benefit of patients, to pay particular attention to the adverse effects in order to recognize, treat and possibly modulate the therapy with an adequate assessment of the cost benefit ratio and quality of life.",2022,2022-12-01,0,Minerva Stomatologica,humans; immune checkpoint inhibitors; neoplasms; nivolumab; quality of life; retrospective studies; stomatitis,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3204 Immunology; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"DI Cosola, M.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study conducted at two tertiary care diabetes centres in Chennai, India, clinical and biochemical assessment and nonmydriatic ultra-wide field fundus photography was performed in individuals with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose IFG and or impaired glucose tolerance IGTbased on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between 5.7% and 6.4% in 2019. The retinal photographs were graded by certified ophthalmologists. Systemic risk factors associated with DR in prediabetes were assessed.The mean age of the 192 individuals with prediabetes was 48 13 years (55.2% were males). DR was present in 12 (6.3%) individuals of which nine (4.7%) had mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and three (1.6%) had moderate NPDR. None had severe sight-threatening DR. The Poisson multiple regression analysis showed that after adjusting for other systemic covariates, HbA1c values 6% (6-6.4%) was associated withtimes higher relative risk of DR (Risk ratio 1.95 (95% CI 1.07-3.545,0.028) in comparison to HbA1c 6%). CONCLUSION: DR was present in about 6% of the Asian Indians with prediabetes. Higher HbA1c values among individuals with prediabetes was associated with twice the relative risk for DR.

Previous epidemiologic studies have reported various systemic and demographic risk factors for AH but remain limited due to regional constraints of their study populations. Additionally, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic black populations remain under sampled. The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of asteroid hyalosis in the United States and identify associated factors at a national level.Subjects MethodsThis is a population-based, cross-sectional study of 5578 subjects aged 40 and older from the 2005 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The primary outcome measured was asteroid hyalosis on retinal imaging in any eye. Evaluated risk factors included patient demographics, medical history, body measures, serum markers, and fundus photography findings.Prevalence of asteroid hyalosis was 0.86% overall, 0.86% in Caucasians, 0.79% in African-Americans, and 0.88% in Hispanics. Asteroid hyalosis was associated with older age (p 0.0001, 95% confidence interval CI0.06 0.12 odds ratio OR1.09) but not ethnicity or sex. After adjusting for age, greater bodyweight (p 0.049 95% CI, 0.001 0.04 OR, 1.02), and history of myocardial infarction (p 0.022 95% CI, 0.07 1.55 OR, 2.36) were also found to be significant risk factors.ConclusionAsteroid hyalosis is a rare entity in the US associated with older age, greater body weight, and prior history of MI.

Methods: This study included 3405 Japanese community dwellers who were 40 years of age and enrolled in the Hisayama Study. This population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from 2017 to 2018. A glaucoma screening test was performed using stereo fundus images and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Glaucoma was defined based on the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria.The prevalence of glaucoma was 7.6% (95% confidence interval CI6.7-8.6) overall. The prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0-6.6) that of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5-1.1) and that of exfoliation glaucoma was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.7-1.4). In addition to aging, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio OR 1.15 95% CI, 1.02-1.33), higher intraocular pressure (OR 1.06 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), longer axial length (OR 1.44 95% CI, 1.31-1.59), and thinner central corneal thickness (CCT) (OR 1.09 95% CI, 1.04-1.15) were significant risk factors for POAG. Diabetes (OR 2.81 95% CI, 1.19-6.62) was a significant risk factor for PACG, and diabetes (OR 2.15 95% CI, 1.03-4.47) and thinner CCT (OR 1.14 95% CI, 1.02-1.28) were significant risk factors for exfoliation glaucoma.The prevalence of glaucoma was approximately 8%, probably due to the increase in the Japanese aging population. Not only ocular factors but also lower eGFR for POAG and diabetes for PACG and exfoliation glaucoma were risk factors in a general Japanese population.

The purpose of the study was to determine the overall prevalence of sleep apnea among patients with glaucoma. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL and gray literature using Clinical Trials.gov, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and conferences held through the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and Canadian Society of Ophthalmology was done until June 10, 2020. Eligible articles were identified by reviewing the retrievedData extracted included the total number of patients with glaucoma and the proportion of glaucoma patients with a co-occurring diagnosis of OSA. STATA 15.0 was used to perform the meta-analysis.544 articles were gathered from the databases and 40 records were collected via the gray literature search. Ten studies with 956 subjects were included for analysis. The of the meta-analysis demonstrated a significant rate of OSA among glaucoma patients (ES 0.17 CI: 0.08, 0.25 ). CONCLUSION: We examine the prevalence of OSA in glaucoma patients and conclude that the prevalence of OSA in glaucoma patients is higher.

"Hadziabdic, S.; Kohl, S.",Private spanner in public works the corrosive effects of private insurance on public life,"Contemporary societies are not only ""risk societies"", but also insurance societies. While the shift of systemic risks from the community to the individual is a distinctive trait of modernity, research on the consequences of this process has focused almost exclusively on welfare state responses aimed at re-collectivizing societal risks. Individual-level reactions associated with the need for a private safety net against the uncertainty brought by risk societies have been largely overlooked. What happens to a society and its individuals when private insurance becomes commonplace Focusing on Germany, we use the data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (1984-2018) to investigate the attitudinal antecedents and consequences of contracting private insurance. As one of the most important sources of private welfare, life insurance attracts risk-averse individuals who are highly concerned with public economic affairs and see the market-based solutions of conservative parties as the best way to safeguard their economic security. While short-term attitudinal effects are absent, a longitudinal approach reveals that becoming insured gradually increases economic security but also entails withdrawal from public life and aversion to parties that support social redistribution. The loss of dynamism of a society may thus be related not only to public welfare but also to a private institution at the heart of the financial markets, which moreover has privatizing, welfare-eroding effects. The paper argues for a more general sociology of insurance.",2022,2022-06-16,0,British Journal of Sociology,caustics; germany; humans; insurance; social welfare,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,"Hadziabdic, S.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter retrospective cohort study took place at neonatal intensive care units of 48 children's hospitals in the US in the Pediatric Health Information System database from 2010 to 2020. Participants included preterm infants with gestational age at birth 227 to 317 weeks who had ROP treated with anti-VEGF therapy or laser photocoagulation. Exposures: Anti-VEGF therapy vs laser photocoagulation. Main Outcomes and Measures: New receipt of pulmonary vasodilators at leastdays after ROP therapy was compared between exposure groups, matched using propensity scores generated from preexposure variables, and adjusted for birth year and hospital. The odds of receiving an echocardiogram after 30 days of age was also included to adjust for secular trends and interhospital variation in PH screening.Among 1577 patients (55.9% male) meeting inclusion criteria, 689 received laser photocoagulation and 888 received anti-VEGF treatment (95% bevacizumab, 5% ranibizumab). Patients were first treated for ROP at median 36.4 weeks' postmenstrual age (IQR, 34.6-38.7). A total of 982 patients (491 in each group) were propensity score matched. Good covariate balance was achieved, as indicated by a model variance ratio of 1.15. More infants who received anti-VEGF therapy were treated for PH, but when adjusted for hospital and year, this was no longer statistically significant (6.7% 95% CI, 2.6-6.9 vs 4.3% 95% CI, 4.4-10.2 adjusted odds ratio, 1.62 95% CI, 0.90-2.89 .10). and Relevance: Anti-VEGF therapy was not associated with greater use of pulmonary vasodilators after adjustment for hospital and year. Our findings suggest exposure to anti-VEGF may be associated with PH, although we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding based on systemic comorbidities or hospital variation in practice.

The primary goal was to recognize the chromatographic conditions wherein propitious segregation of the integrants with quality peaks can be attained. An attempt to expound the target analytical profile was made to accomplish this goal, and critical method attributes (CMAs), viz. percentage acetonitrile content, injection volume and pH, which affect critical quality attributes (CQAs), were identified using systemic risk analysis. Box-Behnken design was employed to develop a relationship between CMAs and CQAs, which engenders an analytical design space. Efficient chromatographic separation for pregabalin and piperine was attained using an analytical C18 column and mobile phase comprising acetonitrile-water (pH 6.9 70:30%,v) in an isocratic elution mode with aml min flow rate. The elution was descried at an isosbestic wavelength of 221 nm using a photodiode array detector. The International Conference on Harmonization guidelines were adopted for the developed HPLC method. The validated HPLC method can be further utilized for the simultaneous quantification and detection of pregabalin and piperine in other lipid-based nanopharmaceuticals such as polymeric nanoparticles, nanocrystals, solid-lipid nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, etc., in in vitro and in vivo studies.",2022,2022-09-30,7,Biomedical Chromatography,"acetonitriles; chromatography, high pressure liquid; limit of detection; lipids; liposomes; pregabalin; reproducibility of results",34 Chemical Sciences; 3401 Analytical Chemistry,"Gupta, I.

However, a quantitative assessment of individual companies’ impact on the networks’ overall production is hitherto non-existent. Based on a unique value added tax dataset, we construct the firm-level production network of an entire country at an unprecedented granularity and present a novel approach for computing the economic systemic risk (ESR) of all firms within the network.

Firm size cannot explain the ESR of individual companies their position in the production networks matters substantially.

We apply a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model to analyze the dynamic spillover effects in the Chinese financial system. We find that the 2017 house price control policies have significantly increased the risk of China’s financial system. Before 2017, with the prosperity of the real estate market, the interconnectedness of the Chinese financial system continued to decline, while after 2017, with the slowdown of house price growth and the downturn of the real estate market, the interconnectedness turned to increase. For different sectors, the trends and the magnitudes of the spillover effects are diverse, and any sector can contribute to systemic risk in a dynamic way.

There is no scientific conclusion about its specific pathogenic mechanism at present. Most clinical scholars generally support the theory that the partial human anatomical structure and various systemic risk psychological factors cause insufficient oxygen supply and hemostasis in the local branch retinal arteries. The research of this article aim to reconstruct a non-nanocell-targeted thrombolytic drug delivery system without modification of rtPA without polyethylene glycol-methyl polycaprolactone and to re-evaluate its thrombus targeting and dissolution. The effect and safety of thrombus provide a new strategy for realizing combined treatment of thrombus. It is a study on the targeting of rtPA-NP to thrombus and its thrombolytic properties. HPLC method was used to detect the binding of fibrin clot prepared in vitro with coumarin-6 labeled NP and rtPA-NP immunofluorescence technique was used to observe the location of nanomedicine and fibrin clot in branch retinal vein occlusion model Condition. The rtPA-NP drug delivery system constructed in this study not only retains the activity of rtPA and good thrombus targeting but also significantly prolongs its half-life and simplifies the way of administration. The therapeutic efficiency of rtPA-NP thrombus targeted administration on branch retinal vein occlusion reached 85.64%. The successful construction of the rtPA-NP thrombus targeted drug delivery system provides a new way for thrombosis treatment and lays the foundation for the future combination of anticoagulants and vascular protection drugs to achieve the combined treatment of thrombosis and the development of safe and efficient thrombolytic drugs.,2022,2022-03-31,0,Cellular and Molecular Biology,"diabetes mellitus, type 2; fibrin; fibrinolytic agents; humans; nanoparticles; recombinant proteins; retinal vein occlusion; thrombolytic therapy; thrombosis; tissue plasminogen activator",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Zhang, H.

Methods: Thirty-one healthy individuals, 40 people with no sign of DR and 60 people with mild NPDR were included in this cross-sectional study. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to measure the MT of each participant. The potential relationship between MT and systemic risk factors for DR, including diabetes duration, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum lipids, and blood pressure, was analyzed.The MT of the right and left eyes in the central and inner ring regions of the NPDR group and NDR group were significantly different from that in the control group. The MTs of the right and left eyes in the central region and inner ring region were also significantly different between the NPDR group and NDR group, but the MTs of the right and left eyes in the outer ring region were not significantly different among the three groups. Diabetic duration, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure were positively correlated with the MT of the right and left eyes in the central region.

First, we analyze the risk of RMB internationalization and its transmission mechanism from the perspective of the economic characteristics of neighboring countries and trading partner countries. Second, we use the FASP index system construction method for reference to construct a forecast index system for macro- and microrisks brought about by RMB internationalization. Then, the weight of each index is determined through index common degree analysis and principal component analysis, and the risk of RMB internationalization is divided. On this basis, the risks of RMB internationalization in China from 2000 to 2019 are divided into four categories. Based on the BP neural network algorithm optimized by the simulated degradation algorithm, the PCA-SA-BPNN model of RMB internationalization risk forecast is constructed. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by experimental verification, and the risk status of RMB internationalization in 2020 is simulated and predicted. The research show that the risk status of RMB internationalization in 2020 is basically safe, and the risks of RMB internationalization mainly come from macroeconomic growth risks and systemic risks of the financial system.",2022,2022-09-29,0,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,"algorithms; china; neural networks, computer; risk assessment","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics","Hu, S.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Two workstreams (W) will run in parallel. W1 will aim to develop a taxonomy of incident reporting in care homes, underpinned by structured interviews (N 150) with care home representatives, scoping review of care home incident reporting systems, and a review of incident reporting policy related to care homes. The taxonomy will be developed using a standardised approach to taxonomy development. W2 will be structured in three phases (P). P1a will consist of 40 interviews with care home staff to develop a better understanding of their specific internal systems for reporting incidents, and P1b will include 30 interviews with others involved in transitions between hospital and care home. P1a and P1b will also examine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on safe transitions. P2 will consist of a retrospective documentary analysis of care home data relating to resident transitions, with data size and sampling determined based on data sources identified in P1a. A validated data extraction form will be adapted before use. P3 will consist of four validation and codesign workshops to develop a service specification using National Health Service Improvement's service specification framework, which will then be mapped against existing systems and recommendations produced. Framework analysis informed by the heuristic of systemic risk factors will be the primary mode of analysis, with content analysis used for analysing incident reports.

However, because of physiological multifactorial adaptations during pregnancy, retinal vascular occlusive disease may occur spontaneously. In addition, a patent foramen ovale is a risk factor for an ischemic thromboembolic event. Since fluorescein angiography, a central tool in the evaluation of these occlusions, should be avoided during pregnancy, optical coherence tomography angiography, a novel technique, offers a good opportunity for visualizing vascular perfusion of retinal tissue.Case presentationHere we present a case series of three patients (Caucasian, nonsmoker) who visited our clinic owing to acute visual impairment and central scotoma. Using regular optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography, retinal vascular occlusions were detected, thus initiating the evaluation of systemic risk factors. We report two patients (30 and 32 years old) who developed cilioretinal artery occlusion but whose etiology differed: one was of thromboembolic origin associated with patent foramen ovale, while the other was caused by hemodynamic blockade secondary to central retinal vein occlusion. In both cases, optical coherence tomography angiography revealed reperfusion of the cilioretinal artery occlusion. However, transient ischemia led to retinal atrophy after a few weeks. In the third patient (32 years old),weeks after onset of scotoma, optical coherence tomography angiography revealed atrophy of the middle layers and impaired perfusion in the deep capillary plexus, and thus a paracentral acute middle maculopathy was diagnosed. All patients regained normal visual acuity and had otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, and laboratory blood tests did not reveal any defects or alterations.As shown here, optical coherence tomography angiography enables risk-free imaging of retinal vessel perfusion during pregnancy. Together with regular optical coherence tomography, it allows one to predict functional outcome according to the existing retinal occlusion-related atrophy.",2022,2022-04-21,0,Journal of Medical Case Reports,"adult; atrophy; female; fluorescein angiography; foramen ovale, patent; humans; ischemia; pregnancy; retinal artery occlusion; retinal diseases; retinal vessels; scotoma; tomography, optical coherence",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Jürgens, L.

We ask whether and how these altered relations in themselves constitute novel uncertainties and risks between the two fields. To better understand these dynamics, we introduce the concept of ""risk entanglement"" to complement financialization as a key concept presently capturing these relations. Based on qualitative research in the German finance-state nexus, we show how financial and state actors mutually construe each other as risks that need to be managed and mitigated to safeguard their particular, field-specific logics and ends.

"Jiang, H.; Gao, Y.; Fu, W.; Xu, H.",Risk factors and treatments of suprachoroidal hemorrhage,"Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) is a rare but serious sight-threatening complication of inner eye surgery. Despite continuous advances in treatment, visual prognosis remains poor. The disease has a more typical clinical presentation, the etiology and pathogenesis are not well defined, and intraoperative ocular and systemic factors may induce fulminant SCH. To investigate risk factors and treatments of SCH-associated intraocular surgeries, summarize diagnosis, characteristics, management, and prevention of SCH developed during and after intraocular surgeries. A retrospective study of SCH occurred in six cases of intraocular surgeries including cataract, glaucoma, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), and silicone oil removal surgery. Assess baseline systemic and ocular characteristics of SCH eyes. Analyze the second surgery timing and technique, and visual outcomes were measured. SCH occurred in six patients including five eyes during surgeries and one eye after the surgery. Three eyes that underwent cataract surgery had hard nucleuses (nuclear sclerotic). One eye was due to hypotony during the vitrectomy procedure. One eye developed SCH when silicone oil was extracted from the eyeball. One eye developed delayed SCH after glaucoma surgery. Incision closure and anterior chamber deepening were performed. B-scan ultrasonography was used to diagnose SCH, and determine the timing and location of sclerotomy for the second surgery. Vitrectomy and sclerotomy were performed in five eyes. The median follow-up time was six months. The final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 in one eye, one eye had light perception with retinal adherence, and four eyes had no light perception with retinal detachment. The showed that risk factors including advanced age, hypertension, taking anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and cardiovascular drugs were systemic risk factors, and hard nucleus (nuclear sclerosis) cataract, long-term uncontrolled ocular hypertension glaucoma, vitrectomy, silicone oil removal, high myopia, aphakia, previous intraocular surgery, intraocular pressure during surgery, and others were ocular risk factors. The most important risk factor is a sudden drop in intraocular pressure during or after surgery. The outcome of visual acuity depends on retinal status.

"Zhou, X.; Zheng, S.; Zhang, H.; Liu, Q.; Xing, W.; Li, X.; Han, Y.; Zhao, P.",Risk transmission of trade price fluctuations from a nickel chain perspective: based on systematic risk entropy and granger causality networks,"Nickel is a strategic mineral resource, with 65% of nickel being used in stainless steel. The situation in Ukraine starting in February 2022 has led to significant fluctuations in nickel prices, with prices of nickel products along the same chain affecting and passing through each other. Using systematic risk entropy and granger causality networks, we measure the volatility risk of trade prices of nickel products using the nickel industry chain trade data from 2000-2019 and explore the transmission patterns of different volatility risk prices from the industry chain perspective. The findings show that: (1) Nickel ore has the highest risk of import trade price volatility and a strong influence, but low risk transmission. Stainless steel has the highest trade price impact but is also subject to the strongest passive influence. (2) The Americas have a higher risk of trade price volatility but a weaker influence. The influence and sensitivity of trade prices is stronger in Asia and Europe. (3) Indonesia's stainless steel export prices have a high rate of transmission and strong influence. Germany's ferronickel export prices are highly susceptible to external influences and can continue to spread loudly. Russian nickel ore export prices are able to quickly spread their impact to other regions.",2022,2022-08-31,2,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Zhou, X.

"Arthur, D.; John, D.; Fleming, J.J.; Rebekah, G.; Gowri, M.; John, S.S.",Role of hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin b12 deficiency in central and hemi-central retinal vein occlusion: A case control study,"Retinal venous occlusive diseases have been recognized as a major cause of ocular morbidity. Hyperhomocysteinemia could be a potentially modifiable risk factor.To determine the association of hyperhomocysteinemia with central and hemi-central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO and HCRVO), the correlation of serum levels of homocysteine with Vitamin B12 and folate levels and the association of Vitamin B12 deficiency with hyperhomocysteinemia. METHODS: In this case-control study, patients with CRVO and HCRVO, and age- and gender-matched controls without CRVO and HCRVO, who met the eligibility criteria, were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Data obtained from participants using a questionnaire, complete ophthalmological examination and relevant investigations, including estimation of serum homocysteine, Vitamin B12 and folate levels, were collated and analyzed.Thirty-nine cases with CRVO and HCRVO and 39 age- and gender-matched controls were studied. We found a significant association of hypertension (P 0.01), hyperlipidemia (P 0.01), and abnormal blood profile (P 0.01) with retinal vein occlusion. There was no statistically significant association of hyperhomocysteinemia with CRVO and HCRVO (P 0.81). However, we found a high prevalence of both hyperhomocysteinemia (43.58% of cases and 53.84% of controls 0.81) and Vitamin B12 deficiency (23.08% of cases and 38.46% of controls 0.14) in cases and controls, without a statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to both parameters. Our study also found a negative correlation of serum levels of homocysteine with Vitamin B12 (Pearson correlation co-efficient0.3874,0.0005), and folate (Pearson correlation coefficient0.3886,0.0004) of the study participants. Among the study participants (n 78), the odds of patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency having hyperhomocysteinemia were 7.0 (2.26-21.72) times those of patients without Vitamin B12 deficiency (P 0.001). Similarly, among the cases (CRVO,39), the odds of patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency having hyperhomocysteinemia were 7.0 (1.22-40.09) times those of patients without Vitamin B12 deficiency (P 0.029). In the control group also (non-CRVO,39), the odds of patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency having hyperhomocysteinemia were 6.67 (1.47-30.21) times those of patients without Vitamin B12 deficiency (P 0.014). CONCLUSION: Hyperhomocysteinemia was not found to be an independent risk factor for retinal vein occlusion in our study. However, we found a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and Vitamin B12 deficiency in both cases and controls, without a statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to both parameters. We also found a negative correlation of serum homocysteine levels with Vitamin B12 and folate levels. The odds of patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency having hyperhomocysteinemia were seven times those of patients without Vitamin B12 deficiency. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and abnormal blood profile had a significant association with CRVO and HCRVO. Many of the systemic risk factors for retinal vein occlusions are found to be associated with elevation of serum homocysteine levels, which may be part of a final common pathway in bringing about a state of accelerated atherosclerosis, leading to CRVO or HCRVO. Therefore, lowering serum levels of homocysteine by Vitamin B12 and folate supplementation could have a role in the prevention of these diseases.",2022,2022-03-02,0,Oman Journal of Ophthalmology,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Arthur, D.

The secondary was to identify other contributory ischemic factors. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study from a tertiary eye hospital in patients who underwent full-day diurnal variation of tension (DVT). Blood pressure (BP) and IOP measurements were done everyh over 24 h. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and MOPP were calculated. The nocturnal dip in BP was assessed patients were classified as non-dippers, dippers, and over-dippers. The circadian MOPP fluctuation (CMF) was calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and its relationship with type and severity of visual field was assessed.In total, 149 patients were evaluated 109 were classified as NTG, and 40 were classified as POAG. A nocturnal dip in BP was noted in 20% of NTG and 17.5% of POAG. The MAP was found to be lower in patients with NTG than POAG. In the NTG subgroup, we found that 20% of patients were over-dippers, 32% were dippers, and 48% were non-dippers. The CMF showed a greater fluctuation for over-dippers (P 0.004 for the RE and 0.003 for the LE) than dippers and non-dippers. A weak positive correlation of CMF with the severity of fields was found. CONCLUSION: A 24-h monitoring of IOP, BP, MOPP, and assessment of systemic risk factors for primary glaucoma acts as an invaluable tool for the comprehensive management of NTG despite the limitations posed by DVT and BP recording.",2022,2022-01-27,1,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,"blood pressure; circadian rhythm; cross-sectional studies; glaucoma, open-angle; humans; intraocular pressure; low tension glaucoma; tonometry, ocular",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Dinakaran, S.

This study compares risk factor profiles for thromboembolism among patients with RAO and stroke, respectively. METHODS: This case-control study is based on 5683 RAO patients entered in the Danish National Patient Register between 1st of January 2000 and 31st of December 2018. Cases were matched on sex, year of birth, and age at event with 28,415 stroke patients. The Danish nationwide registries were used to collect information about age, sex, previous diagnoses, and drug prescriptions. Adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between hypothesised risk factors and the patient outcome.For atrial fibrillation, a substantially stronger association to stroke was found, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.47-0.58) when comparing RAO patients with stroke patients. RAO was stronger associated with arterial hypertension, peripheral artery disease, retinal vein occlusion, cataract, and glaucoma with OR's ranging from 1.21-11.70. The identified effect measures reached equivalence or was close to equivalence for diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and renal disease.

This paper focuses on foreign direct investment (FDI) as an important part of its broad impact in improving the level of capital circulation and diversifying the non-systemic risk of a single country portfolio. Using data from 35 countries on direct investment in China, we find that the impact of the social environment on healthy investment behavior is mainly reflected in investors' resistance to cultural distance and their benefit compensation across institutional distance. In addition, their joint influence is still negative, dominated by cultural distance, which can still verify that institutional distance mitigates the negative effect of cultural distance on FDI. Therefore, in order to promote international healthy investment behavior, it is feasible to improve both the mitigation effect of the institution in the short term and promote the level of cultural exchange in the long term, according to the research of this paper.",2022,2022-01-05,1,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,china; economic development; health facilities; internationality; investments; social environment,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Li, D.

"Nguyen, C.T.N.; Yosef, M.; Khalatbari, S.; Shah, A.R.",Sociodemographic variables associated with risk for diabetic retinopathy,":Several systemic and sociodemographic factors have been associated with the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, there is limited investigation of the potential role sociodemographic factors may play in augmenting systemic risk factors of DR. We hypothesize that age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, and insurance payor have an impact on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index, and systolic blood pressure, and therefore an upstream effect on the development of DR and vision-threatening forms of DR (VTDR).Methods:Multivariable analysis of longitudinal electronic health record data at a large academic retina clinic was performed. Sociodemographic factors included race, ethnicity, income, and insurance payor. Systemic risk factors for DR included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and body mass index (BMI). VTDR was identified from encounter diagnostic codes indicating proliferative retinopathy or diabetic macular edema. Patient-reported primary address zip codes were used to approximate income level, stratified into quartiles.:From 2016 to 2018, 3,470 patients with diabetes totaled 11,437 visits were identified. Black patients had higher HbA1c and SBP compared to White patients. White patients had higher BMI and SBP compared to patients of unknown other race and greater odds of VTDR than the latter. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity had significantly higher SBP than non-Hispanic patients. Low-income patients had higher BMI and SBP than high-income patients and greater odds of VTDR than the latter. Medicaid recipients had greater odds of VTDR than those with Blue Care Network (BCN) and Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) insurance. Medicaid and Medicare recipients had higher SBP compared to BCBS recipients. Finally, both higher HbA1c and SBP had greater odds of VTDR. There were no differences in odds of VTDR between White and Black patients or between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.Conclusion:Significant associations exist between certain sociodemographic factors and well-known risk factors for DR. Income and payor were associated with increased severity of systemic risk factors and presence of VTDR.

In this regard, the purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for diagnosing and regulating the stability of financial development based on a systematic approach. The study used systematic, comparative, and GEO analysis, econometric methods. As a result, new indicators have been developed to diagnose the financial development of countries. The authors also propose criteria, which could be used to signal the need for countercyclical regulation tools. The novelty of the study lies in a systematic approach to the diagnosis and regulation of the stability of financial development. The systemic nature of the study is ensured by the application of the statistical framework of the System of National Accounts. Testing of the developed indicators and criteria was carried out in relation to the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries for the period 2007-2020. As a result of the testing, a rating of countries was built according to the level of stability of financial development. This rating highlighted leading countries as well as countries generating systemic risks. The study also assessed the legal grounds behind the of a countercyclical markup by a number of countries.

"Qiu, W.",Systematic risk analysis of semiconductor global market based on deep feature fusion k-means algorithm,"As the global semiconductor industry has entered a new round of rapid growth, it has also entered a golden cycle of economic growth. Semiconductor companies increase their intrinsic value through financing, industry mergers and acquisitions, and venture capital searches. At the same time, market investors pay more attention to the intrinsic value of companies when looking for good investment targets. Therefore, the systematic risk assessment of the global semiconductor market has become a common concern of market investors and corporate management. In this context, this paper found a method that can assess the systemic risk of the semiconductor global market, which is to use the K-means algorithm based on deep feature fusion. This paper analyzed the algorithm in depth, analyzed the quantum space of tensors, and used the definition of cluster fusion to obtain the relationship between the projection matricesand V. Experiments were carried out on the improved algorithm, and market research was conducted on a multinational semiconductor company A, which mainly included the basic statistics of the rate of return and the ACF and PACF coefficients of the rate of return series. Finally, the stock risk comparison of company A and companyin the same period was carried out. The experimental showed that comparing the three items of compound growth rate, coefficient of variation, and active rate coefficient, the highest compound growth rate was 0.41, which came from Category 2, the highest variation coefficient was 2.31, which came from Category 10, and the highest active rate coefficient was 1.78, which came from Category 9.

"Gao, Q.","Systemic risk analysis of multi-layer financial network system based on multiple interconnections between banks, firms, and assets","Global financial systems are increasingly interconnected, and risks can spread more easily, potentially causing systemic risks. Research on systemic risk based on multi-layer financial networks is relatively scarce, and studies usually focus on only one type of risk. This paper develops a model of the multi-layer financial network system based on three types of links: firm-bank credit, asset-bank portfolio, and interbank lending, which simulates systemic risk under three risk sources: firm credit default, asset depreciation, and bank bankruptcy. The impact of the multi-layer financial network structure, default risk threshold, and bank asset allocation strategy is further explored. It has been shown that the larger the risk shock, the greater the systemic risk under different risk sources, and the risk propagation cycle tends to rise and then decline. As centralized nodes in the multi-layer financial network system, bank nodes may play both blocking and propagation roles under different risk sources. Furthermore, the multi-layer financial network system is most susceptible to bank bankruptcy risk, followed by firm credit default risk. Further research indicates that increasing the average degree of firms in the bank-firm credit network, the density of the bank-asset portfolio network, and the bank capital adequacy ratio all contribute to reducing systemic risk under the three risk sources. Additionally, the more assets a bank holds in a single market, the more vulnerable it is to the risks associated with that market.",2022,2022-09-06,1,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Gao, Q.

This study aims to investigate cardiovascular parameters and the risk of hypertensive urgency after IVIs. METHODS: Patients who received IVIs for retinal macular diseases were enrolled retrospectively. Patients who received cataract surgeries were enrolled as controls. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured 10 minutes before, immediately after, and more than 30 minutes after IVIs and cataract surgery.

In view of this, this paper evaluates the impact of climate transition risks on the financial system from the perspective of carbon tax. Based on the micro data of bank and enterprise loans, this paper uses a bottom-up approach to study the systemic risk of the banking sector caused by the carbon tax. Based on the actual data of China’s banking sector in 2017, we find that there is an exponential relationship between the carbon tax and systemic risk, and there is a threshold for both the whole banking sector and different types of banks. When the carbon tax is higher than the threshold, systemic risk will increase significantly with the increase of the carbon tax level. At the same time, the show that the systemic risk caused by the carbon tax has obvious sector heterogeneity and regional heterogeneity. Therefore, in the process of implementing carbon tax policies, the differences between sectors and regions should be taken into account, so as to effectively prevent and control systemic risks in the banking sector while improving the efficiency of carbon tax policies.",2022,2022-03-23,3,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,carbon; carbon dioxide; climate change,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Li, S.

Using the local projection method (Jord 2004, 2005, 2009), we forecast the dynamic responses of the betas of hedge fund strategies to macroeconomic and financial shocks especially volatility and illiquidity shocks over the subprime crisis in order to investigate their market timing activities. In a robustness check, using TVAR (Balke 2000), we simulate the reaction of hedge fund strategies’ betas in extreme scenarios allowing moderate and strong adverse shocks. Our show that the behavior of hedge fund strategies regarding the monitoring of systematic risk is highly nonlinear in extreme scenarios especially during the subprime crisis. We find that countercyclical strategies have an investment technology which differs from procyclical ones. During crises, the former seek to capture non-traditional risk premia by deliberately increasing their systematic risk while the later focus more on minimizing risk. Our suggest that the hedge fund strategies’ betas respond more to illiquidity uncertainty than to illiquidity risk during crises. We find that illiquidity and VIX shocks are the major drivers of systemic risk in the hedge fund industry.",2022,2022-03-07,3,Financial Innovation,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Racicot, F.

"Wiglesworth, A.; Clement, D.N.; Wingate, L.R.; Klimes‐Dougan, B.",Understanding suicide risk for youth who are both black and native american: the role of intersectionality and multiple marginalization,"Native American and multiracial youth experience elevated risk for suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) however, intersectional identities are often unexamined in suicide research. METHOD: We examined the prevalence of SI and SA, and the impact of intersectional identities (sex, sexual minority identity, and economic insecurity) on these rates, in 496 biracial Black-Native American, 2,804 Native American, 14,220 Black, 5,569 biracial Native American-White, 4,076 biracial Black-White, and 118,816 White youth who participated in the Minnesota Student Survey.Black-Native American youth reports of SI and SA resembled other Native American youth and were significantly higher than those reported by Black, White, and Black-White (SA only) youth. While sexual minority youth reported higher rates of SI and SA than heterosexual youth, this difference between sexual minority and heterosexual Black-Native American youth was smaller as compared to their peers. CONCLUSION: Though they largely resemble their mono biracial Native American peers, Black-Native American youth show some distinct patterns of SA when accounting for their intersectional identities. Despite presumed similarities in systemic risk factors, Black and Black-Native American youth differ considerably in reported suicidality.

Methods: A retrospective review of records of both referred and babies born in our hospital who were screened for ROP within the last 21 months at a tertiary care centre was done. The newborns were screened as per National Neonatology Forum of India guidelines. ROP was classified according to the International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity criteria.A total of 167 neonates were screened with an incidence of ROP of 26.9%. The mean gestational age (GA) and mean birth weight (BW) were 31.89 2.824 weeks and 1538.11 530.84 gm. The mean BW of neonates having any ROP was significantly lower (1296.98gm,0.001), and the mean GA was also significantly lower in ROP babies (30.67 weeks,0.001).

"Larson, H.J.; Lin, L.; Goble, R.",Vaccines and the social amplification of risk,"In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) named ""Vaccine Hesitancy"" one of the top 10 threats to global health. Shortly afterward, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as the world's predominant health concern. COVID-19 vaccines of several types have been developed, tested, and partially deployed with remarkable speed vaccines are now the primary control measure and hope for a return to normalcy. However, hesitancy concerning these vaccines, along with resistance to masking and other control measures, remains a substantial obstacle. The previous waves of vaccine hesitancy that led to the WHO threat designation, together with recent COVID-19 experience, provide a window for viewing new forms of social amplification of risk (SAR). Not surprisingly, vaccines provide fertile ground for questions, anxieties, concerns, and rumors. These appear in new globalized hyperconnected communications landscapes and in the context of complex human (social, economic, and political) systems that exhibit evolving concerns about vaccines and authorities. We look at drivers, impacts, and implications for vaccine initiatives in several recent historical examples and in the current efforts with COVID-19 vaccination. Findings and insights were drawn from the Vaccine Confidence Project's decade long monitoring of media and social media and its related research efforts. The trends in vaccine confidence and resistance have implications for updating the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) in turn, SARF has practical implications for guiding efforts to alleviate vaccine hesitancy and to mitigate harms from intentional and unintentional vaccine scares.",2022,2022-05-14,5,Risk Analysis,covid-19; covid-19 vaccines; humans; pandemics; vaccination; vaccines,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media,"Larson, H.J.

DESIGN: An observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two patients (20 men andwomen) with treatment-na ve unilateral CSC and 28 normal eyes of 28 age-matched, healthy participants (21 men andwomen). METHODS: We performed enhanced depth imaging of swept-source (SS) OCT with a viewing angle of vertical 20 mm horizontal 23 mm. Moreover, we developed a grid consisting ofsubfields, with diameters of 3, 9, and 18 mm the inner and outer rings were enclosed by circles with diameters ofandmm andand 18 mm, respectively, which were divided intosubfields-superotemporal, inferotemporal, superonasal, and inferonasal. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Widefield changes in choroidal thickness.The mean duration from the presumed onset of CSC was 6.8 3.1 months during the examination. Compared with that in normal eyes, the choroidal thickness in eyes of patients with CSC was significantly greater in all subfields (P 0.020 for fellow eyes 0.001 for eyes with CSC).

Methods: A machine-learning-based KOA progression prediction model is developed using the data from the National Institute of Health Osteoarthritis Biomarkers Consortium. According to Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of plain radiographs at baseline, the subjects are divided into either KOA onset or deterioration study groups. The disease progression is defined as the changes in both joint space width (JSW) and WOMAC pain score. In addition to radiographic and symptomatic data, the anthropological particulars, history of the knee injury and surgery, metabolic syndrome and living habits were deployed in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict disease progression in each study group. The relative contributions of each risk factors were weighted via DeepLIFT gradient. Additionally, statistical interactions among risk factors were identified compared.Our model achieved AUC of 0.843 (95% CI 0.824, 0.862) and 0.765 (95% CI 0.756, 0.774) in prediction of KOA onset and deterioration, respectively. For KOA onset prediction, history of injury has attained the highest DeepLIFT gradient except medial joint space narrowing while for KOA deterioration prediction, diabetes and habit of smoking obtained second and third highest gradients respectively aside from medial joint space narrowing, surpassing the impact of the injury.

Based on daily interest rate data of representative bond categories, this study conducted a dynamic analysis based on generalized vector autoregressive volatility spillover variance decomposition, constructed a complex network, and adopted the minimum spanning tree method to clarify and analyze the risk propagation path between different bond types. It is found that the importance of each bond type is positively correlated with liquidity, transaction volume, and credit rating, and the inter-bank market is the most important market in the entire bond market, while interest rate bonds, bank bonds and urban investment bonds are important varieties with great systemic importance. In addition, the long-term trend of the dynamic spillover index of China's bond market falls in line with the pace of the interest rate adjustments.

"Heinrich, T.; Sabuco, J.; Farmer, J.D.",A simulation of the insurance industry: the problem of risk model homogeneity,"We develop an agent-based simulation of the catastrophe insurance and reinsurance industry and use it to study the problem of risk model homogeneity. The model simulates the balance sheets of insurance firms, who collect premiums from clients in return for insuring them against intermittent, heavy-tailed risks. Firms manage their capital and pay dividends to their investors and use either reinsurance contracts or cat bonds to hedge their tail risk. The model generates plausible time series of profits and losses and recovers stylized facts, such as the insurance cycle and the emergence of asymmetric firm size distributions. We use the model to investigate the problem of risk model homogeneity. Under the European regulatory framework Solvency II, insurance companies are required to use only certified risk models. This has led to a situation in which only a few firms provide risk models, creating a systemic fragility to the errors in these models. We demonstrate that using too few models increases the risk of nonpayment and default while lowering profits for the industry as a whole. The presence of the reinsurance industry ameliorates the problem but does not remove it. Our suggest that it would be valuable for regulators to incentivize model diversity.

"Tsamou, M.; Pistollato, F.; Roggen, E.L.",A tau-driven adverse outcome pathway blueprint toward memory loss in sporadic (Late-Onset) alzheimer's disease with plausible molecular initiating event plug-ins for environmental neurotoxicants,"The worldwide prevalence of sporadic (late-onset) Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is dramatically increasing. Aging and genetics are important risk factors, but systemic and environmental factors contribute to this risk in a still poorly understood way. Within the frame of BioMed21, the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept for toxicology was recommended as a tool for enhancing human disease research and accelerating translation of data into human applications. Its potential to capture biological knowledge and to increase mechanistic understanding about human diseases has been substantiated since. In pursuit of the tau-cascade hypothesis, a tau-driven AOP blueprint toward the adverse outcome of memory loss is proposed. Sequences of key events and plausible key event relationships, triggered by the bidirectional relationship between brain cholesterol and glucose dysmetabolism, and contributing to memory loss are captured. To portray how environmental factors may contribute to sAD progression, information on chemicals and drugs, that experimentally or epidemiologically associate with the risk of AD and mechanistically link to sAD progression, are mapped on this AOP. The evidence suggests that chemicals may accelerate disease progression by plugging into sAD relevant processes. The proposed AOP is a simplified framework of key events and plausible key event relationships representing one specific aspect of sAD pathology, and an attempt to portray chemical interference. Other sAD-related AOPs (e.g., Aβ-driven AOP) and a better understanding of the impact of aging and genetic polymorphism are needed to further expand our mechanistic understanding of early AD pathology and the potential impact of environmental and systemic risk factors.",2021,2021-01-01,6,Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,adverse outcome pathways; alzheimer disease; amnesia; animals; brain; humans; memory disorders; risk assessment,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,"Tsamou, M.

"Navarro, d.C.L.; Barbero-Barrera, M.d.M.; Campos, H.A.; Recio, M.J.",Assessment of the adequacy of mobile applications for disaster reduction,"Natural events continue to take a heavy toll on human lives. Added to this are the challenge of dynamic at-risk settings, uncertainty, and increasing threats, which demand holistic, flexible, and quickly adaptable solutions. In this context, mobile applications are strongly emerging as communication tools that can assist in disaster reduction. Yet, these have not been sufficiently evaluated. In view of this, the aim of this research is to evaluate the adequacy of mobile applications in disaster risk reduction in reference to some of the deadliest natural events. To this purpose, a two-part methodology is developed. Firstly, a random sample of applications is evaluated and contrasted with the literature. Secondly, the viability of mobile applications is determined based on the Digital Application Potential Index proposed by the authors, cross-referenced in Geographical Information Systems with the WorldRiskIndex. The show that most mobile applications limit their coverage range to only one stage of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and one type of hazard event, failing to address systemic risk and hampering the scale-up of humanitarian response. For these to become adequate and wide-reaching, strong policies to promote reliability, transparency, and citizen empowerment would be required. The policies establishing the use of mobile applications as a viable tool for DRM must consider reducing the prices of internet connectivity while increasing educational levels, on top of language translation. At this point, the adoption of mobile applications is unable to ensure DRM communication, especially in countries with higher-risk levels, requiring these to be complemented with auxiliary tools.Graphic abstract",2021,2021-09-06,0,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3002 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4104 Environmental Management; 44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies","Navarro de Corcuera, L.

METHODS: Female cynomolgus monkeys (n 39) consumed atherogenic diets containing the women's equivalent of 1000 IU day of vitamin D3. After 32 months consuming the diets, each monkey underwent surgical menopause. After 32 postmenopausal months, CAA and VDR expression were quantified in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Plasma 25OHD3, lipid profiles and serum monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured.In postmenopausal monkeys receiving atherogenic diets, serum MCP-1 was significantly elevated compared with baseline (482.2 174.2 pg ml vs. 349.1 163.2 pg ml, respectively 0.001 0.79) and at the start of menopause (363.4 117.2 pg ml 0.001 0.80). Coronary VDR expression was inversely correlated with serum MCP-1 (p 0.042).

"Wan, Z.; Gao, Y.; Cui, M.; Zhang, Y.",Association between risk factors and retinal nerve fiber layer loss in early stages of diabetic retinopathy,"AIM: To investigate the changes of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) among normal individuals, diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy (NDR) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and explore the possible risk factors of early diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 107 participants were divided in three groups. Totally 31 normal individuals (control group), 40 diabetic patients without DR (NDR group) and 36 patients with NPDR (NPDR group) were included. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to detect RNFL thickness and other optic disc parameters among different groups. The potential association between RNFL loss and systemic risk factors were assessed for DR, including diabetes duration, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum lipids, and blood pressure.The average and each quadrant RNFL thickness were thinner in NPDR group compared to control group of the right (P 0.00,0.01,0.01,0.02,0.04) and left eyes (P 0.00,0.00,0.00,0.03,0.04). The average, superior and inferior RNFL thickness were thinner in NDR group compared to the NPDR group of the right (P 0.00,0.02,0.03) and left eyes (P 0.00,0.00,0.01). Diabetic duration was negatively correlated with the superior, inferior, and average RNFL thickness of the right (r -0.385,0.001 -0.366,0.001 -0.503,0.000) and left eyes (r -0.271,0.018 0.278,0.015 -0.260,0.023).

"Xu, B.; Chen, J.; Zhang, S.; Shen, S.; Lan, X.; Chen, Z.; Yan, Z.; Xu, B.",Association between the severity of diabetic retinopathy and optical coherence tomography angiography metrics,"Diabetic retinopathy, the most serious ocular complication of diabetes, imposes a serious economic burden on society. Automatic and assessment of vessel changes can effectively manage diabetic retinopathy and prevent blindness. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics have been confirmed to be used to assess vessel changes. The accuracy and reliability of OCTA metrics are restricted by vessel segmentation methods. In this study, a multi-branch retinal vessel segmentation method is proposed, which is comparable to the segmentation obtained from the manual segmentation, effectively extracting vessels in low contrast areas and improving the integrity of the extracted vessels. OCTA metrics based on the proposed segmentation method were validated to be reliable for further analysis of the relationship between OCTA metrics and diabetes and the severity of diabetic retinopathy. Changes in vessel morphology are influenced by systemic risk factors. However, there is a lack of analysis of the relationship between OCTA metrics and systemic risk factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 362 eyes of 221 diabetic patients and 1,151 eyes of 587 healthy people. Eight systemic risk factors were confirmed to be closely related to diabetes. After controlling these systemic risk factors, significant OCTA metrics (such as vessel complexity index, vessel diameter index, and mean thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer centered in the macular) were found to be related to diabetic retinopathy and severe diabetic retinopathy.

METHODS: We performed post hoc analyses using data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) studies, which included participants with diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Data were from the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center. In ACCORD, our measure of chronic liver disease was the Dallas Steatosis Index (DSI). In SPRINT, we used self-reported chronic liver disease. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between the measure of chronic liver disease and both baseline and longitudinal cognitive test performance and brain magnetic resonance imaging volume measurements.Among 2969 diabetic participants in ACCORD, the mean age of participants was 62 years, 47% were women. The median DSI was 1.0 (IQR, 0.2-1.8) a DSI of 1.0 corresponds to approximately a 70% probability of having NAFLD. Among 2890 hypertensive participants in SPRINT, the mean age was 68 years, and 37% were women, and 60 (2.1%) had chronic liver disease. There were no consistent associations between liver disease and cognitive performance or brain volumes at baseline or longitudinally after adjustment.

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: The Liwan Eye Study, China. PARTICIPANTS: 1405 baseline participants aged 50 years and older were invited to attend a 10-year follow-up examination. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The International Society of Geographic and Epidemiologic Ophthalmology criteria was used to define glaucoma. Detailed information of mortality was confirmed using the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Presenting visual impairment (PVI) was defined as a presenting visual acuity of less than 20 40 in the better-seeing eye. The 10-year mortality rates were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the association between glaucoma and mortality.A total of 1372 (97.7%) participants with available gonioscopic data were included in the analysis. Of these, 136 (9.9%), 33 (2.4%) and 21 (1.5%) participants had primary angle closure (PAC) suspect (PACS), PAC and PAC glaucoma (PACG), and 29 (2.1%) had primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). After 10 years, 306 (22.3%) participants were deceased. The 10-year mortality was significantly associated with PACG (HR, 2.15, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.04,0.018) but not associated with PAC (HR, 1.27, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.39,0.463), PACS (HR, 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.83,0.099) and POAG (HR, 0.74, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.49,0.395) when age and gender were adjusted for.

Larger vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR 0.30) was only a significant risk factor in multivariable analysis (HR, 1.60, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.33,0.011).PACG was significantly associated with higher long-term mortality, but this association was likely to be confounded by other systemic risk factors.

"Zhu, J.; Zhang, X.; Niu, J.; Shi, Y.; Zhu, Z.; Dai, D.; Chen, C.; Pei, J.; Yuan, G.; Zhang, R.",Biosafety and efficacy evaluation of a biodegradable magnesium-based drug-eluting stent in porcine coronary artery,"Although the drug-eluting stent (DES) has become the standard for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-based revascularization, concerns remain regarding the use of DES, mainly due to its permanent rigid constraint to vessels. A drug-eluting bioresorbable stent (BRS) was thus developed as an alternative to DES, which can be absorbed entirely after its therapeutic period. Magnesium (Mg)-based BRSs have attracted a great deal of attention due to their suitable mechanical properties, innovative chemical features, and well-proven biocompatibility. However, the primary disadvantage of Mg-based BRSs is the rapid degradation rate, resulting in the early loss of structural support long before the recovery of vascular function. Recently, a new type of patented Mg Nd Zn-Zr alloy (JDBM) was developed at Shanghai Jiao Tong University to reduce the degradation rate compared to commercial Mg alloys. In the present investigation, a poly(d,l-lactic acid)-coated and rapamycin eluting (PDLLA RAPA) JDBM BRS was prepared, and its biosafety and efficacy for coronary artery stenosis were evaluated via in vitro and in vivo experiments. The degree of smooth muscle cell adhesion to the PDLLA RAPA coated alloy and the rapamycin pharmacokinetics of JDBM BRS were first assessed in vitro. JDBM BRS and commercial DES FIREHAWK were then implanted in the coronary arteries of a porcine model. Neointimal hyperplasia was evaluated at 30, 90, and 180 days, and re-endothelialization was evaluated at 30 days. Furthermore, Micro-CT and optical coherence tomography (OCT) analyses were performed 180 days after stent implantation to evaluate the technical feasibility, biocompatibility, and degradation characteristics of JDBM BRS in vivo. The show the ability of a PDLLA RAPA coated JDBM to inhibit smooth muscle cell adhesion and moderate the drug release rate of JDBM BRS in vitro. In vivo, low local and systemic risks of JDBM BRS were demonstrated in the porcine model, with preserved mechanical integrity aftermonths of implantation. We also showed that this novel BRS was associated with a similar efficacy profile compared with standard DES and high anti-restenosis performance.

"Méndez, P.F.",Blue uncertainty: warding off systemic risks in the anthropocene lessons from COVID-19,"COVID-19 has made evident the complex interdependence of social and ecological systems and that to reduce the risk of future zoonotic pandemics we must safeguard nature. Approaches based on complexity science taking into account that interdependence and its associated systemic risks must be mainstreamed in current policy making, in general. However, at present, that could result in failure for three main reasons: (1) those approaches might be too sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development (2) the reductionist views from conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy making (3) it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed at stimulating post-pandemic economic development can be steered through radically innovative approaches that remain untested. Here, using COVID-19 as an example,suggest that the use of innovative complexity-based approaches could be enabled through intermediary approaches equipped to resonate with the mindset pervading current policy making.",2021,2021-02-25,1,Earth System Governance,,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,"Méndez, P.F.

This study also evaluates the effect of CEO (chief executive officer) overconfidence and firm-level factors on systemic risk. We employ ΔCoVaR (delta conditional value-at-risk) as a measure of systemic risk and earnings forecast bias to measure CEO overconfidence. We use a fixed effects panel regression approach to evaluate the effect of CEO overconfidence, firm-level factors, and systemic risk. Our findings show that banks that are managed by overconfident CEOs enhance the firm’s contributions to systemic risk. Empirical also show that the firm’s size, leverage ratio, and loan ratio increase the firm’s contributions to systemic risk. Furthermore, return on assets is found to have an inverse relation with systemic risk.

"Kim, Y.; Poncelet, J.; Min, G.; Lee, J.; Yang, Y.",COVID-19: systemic risk and response management in the republic of korea,"This study aimed to investigate the different kinds of risks associated with the novel coronavirus infection in the Republic of Korea and how those risks have been changed by the countermeasures taken by the Korean authorities and citizens. To this end, the authors explored the official database of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) in order to extract risk-related data from January 2020 to April 2021, and then identified the disaster risks and countermeasures from the government press briefings and news media in the same period. Consequently, this study identified three important approaches to enhance the infectious disease response management. First, the government has to respond immediately, even when they lack information and knowledge about the new type of risk. Second, a multi-sectoral response must be prepared to cope with systemic risks. Third, the government should prioritize transparency, inclusive risk governance, and innovative technologies during the initial response stage against risks with high uncertainty and novelty. Aside from these approaches, the types of risks were divided into four categories based on the response measures: anticipated risk against which countermeasures can be planned in advance, lingering risk against which adaptive response should be taken promptly, amplified risk, and emerging risk the last two risks require the established plan to be modified drastically in order to secure higher-level engagement and additional resources. Finally, the authors proposed a risk management flow that can be applied to an in-depth analysis of the intersection between risk and response.",2021,2021-09-03,8,Progress in Disaster Science,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","Kim, Y.

Measures to mitigate the risks of transmitting COVID-19 are creating significant challenges to restarting all surgical services safely. We describe the development of a risk stratification tool to prioritise patients for cataract surgery taking account both specific risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as surgical need’. In addition we report the demographics and comorbidities of patients on our waiting list.MethodsA prospective case review of electronic records was performed. A risk stratification tool was developed based on review of available literature on systemic risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as a surgical need’ score. Scores derived from the tool were used to generaterisk profile groups to allow prioritised allocation of surgery.There were 744 patients awaiting cataract surgery of which 66 (8.9 %) patients were shielding’. One hundred and thirty-two (19.5 %) patients had no systemic comorbidities, 218 (32.1 %) patients hadrelevant systemic comorbidity and 316 (46.5 %) patients hador more comorbidities. Five hundred and ninety patients (88.7 %) did not have significant ocular comorbidities. Using the risk stratification tool, 171 (23 %) patients were allocated in the highestpriority stages. Given an aging cohort with associated increase in number of systemic comorbidities, the majority of patients were in the lower priority stagesto 6.COVID-19 has created an urgent challenge to deal safely with cataract surgery waiting lists. This has driven the need for a prompt and pragmatic change to the way we assess risks and benefits of a previously regarded as low-risk intervention. This is further complicated by the majority of patients awaiting cataract surgery being elderly with comorbidities and at higher risk of mortality related to COVID-19. We present a pragmatic method of risk stratifying patients on waiting lists, blending an evidence-based assessment of risk and patient need combined with an element of shared decision-making.

This study aims to describe the geographic distribution, risk factors, and the challenges in management of slow growing NTM causing pulmonary infections. METHODS: Over a period ofyears, all slow growing NTM received from pulmonary specimens at a tertiary care centre were further studied from electronic hospital records to correlate non tuberculous mycobacteria species with demographics, geographic location, describe comorbidities including immunosuppression, radiologic findings and treatment regimes.M.intracellullare was found in the majority of isolates with significant geographic variation and M.simiae the second commonest found exclusively in southern states. Common comorbidities included a previous history of treatment for tuberculosis, structural lung disease as well as systemic risk factors. Disseminated disease only occurred in immunocompromised hosts as was expected, but at a high rate of 44%. Treatment completion and outcomes were difficult to attain in our population.

METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review. All patients with NAION seen during the acute stage from January 2012 to December 2018 were reviewed. Patients were included if they had documented disc edema and follow up of at least 3mo. Patients with progressive NAION were identified if they worsened inout ofparameters: visual acuity Snellen lines Color vision Ishihara plates the visual field defect involved a new quadrant. The clinical characteristics, time from symptom onset to presentation, systemic risk factors and visual outcome were compared to patients with stable NAION.Totally 122 NAION cases met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 58.1y (range 22-74), 70% were men. Twenty cases (16.4%) had progressive NAION. Patients with progressive NAION did not differ from stable NAION in their demographics, systemic risk factors or in their initial visual deficit. At last follow up, median visual acuity was 1.0 logMAR (IQR 0.64-1.55) in patients with progressive NAION, vs 0.18 (IQR 0.1-0.63) in stable NAION (P 0.001).

"Wszalek, J.A.",Cognitive communication and the law: a model for systemic risks and systemic interventions,"Legal contexts frequently impose steep communication barriers, but because the law's ontological framework of communication views it as an atomized, transaction phenomenon, the law lacks the ability to conceptualize and describe the way in which it itself imposes systemic communication burden. To overcome this shortcoming, this article presents a model for a systemic analysis of communication within the law. Part One operationalizes a set of cognitive-communication resources necessary to navigate communication in legal contexts. Part Two uses the operational model to illustrate how systemic elements of the law pressure the cognitive resources that underlie communication. Finally, Part Three uses the model to predict how possible systemic interventions might improve communication outcomes by alleviating or reducing systemic communication burdens. Not only does this article provide a conceptual tool to articulate the law's systemic impacts on communication, the subsequent analysis offers a framework for exploring interventions that could ultimately lead to better outcomes for persons, particularly vulnerable or at-risk persons, who must navigate legal contexts. By changing how it conceptualizes communication and working to modify the communication dynamics that it itself perpetuates, the law can reduce the weight of the communication burdens that it imposes on the people within it.",2021,2021-04-10,2,Journal of Law and the Biosciences,,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context,"Wszalek, J.A.

"Islam, R.; Volkov, V.",Contagion or interdependence comparing spillover indices,"We propose a novel risk measure that is built on comparing high-frequency time-varying volatility and low-frequency return spillover estimates. This measure permits to identify the markets that are epidemic in their complex interdependence. We conjecture that initially a highly volatile market experiences episodes of risk transmission, but only later absorbs risk and becomes an epidemic market. Moreover, we can detect newly emerging contagion’ in the system. We examine the behaviour of 30 global equity markets and compare spillover measures, which encapsulate many large and small crises episodes. Instead of relying on ex post crisis information, our model identifies crises periods. An important implication of the proposed approach is that highly interrelated markets, such as China, are less likely to transmit a global economic crisis under the current interdependence setting.",2021,2021-12-02,3,Empirical Economics,,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics,"Islam, R.

We demonstrate that this approximation captures a large portion of systemic risk measured by DebtRank.

The electrical grid as an infrastructure is shaped by human activity and public policy in terms of demand and supply requirements. Further, the grid is subject to changes and stresses due to diverse factors including solar weather, climate, hydrology, and ecology. The emerging interconnected and complex network dependencies make such interactions increasingly dynamic, posing novel risks, and presenting new challenges to manage the coupled human natural system. This paper provides a survey of models and methods that seek to explore the significant interconnected impact of the electric power grid and interdependent domains. We also provide relevant critical risk indicators (CRIs) across diverse domains that may be used to assess risks to electric grid reliability, including climate, ecology, hydrology, finance, space weather, and agriculture. We discuss the convergence of indicators from individual domains to explore possible systemic risk, i.e., holistic risk arising from cross-domain interconnections. Further, we propose a compositional approach to risk assessment that incorporates diverse domain expertise and information, data science, and computer science to identify domain-specific CRIs and their union in systemic risk indicators.

We propose a market clustering measure using granular trading data. For each stock, the clustering measure captures the degree of trading overlap among any two investors in that stock, based on a comparison with the expected crowding in a null model where trades are maximally random while still respecting the empirical heterogeneity of both stocks and investors. We investigate the effect of crowded trades on stock price stability and present evidence that market clustering has a causal effect on the properties of the tails of the stock return distribution, particularly the positive tail, even after controlling for commonly considered risk drivers.

The second way consists of using the DTW algorithm to group institutions by the similarity of their contribution to systemic risk, as expressed by DeltaCoVaR, in the periods distinguished. For the crises and the normal states identified during the period 2005-2019 in Europe, we analyzed the similarity of the time series of the topological indicators of MST, constructed for 38 European insurance institutions.

The primary was to identify causative organisms. Secondaryincluded the determination of systemic risk factors and visual prognostic factors. DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: 78 eyes from 62 subjects over a 21-year period from 1999 to 2020 in Auckland, New Zealand. Parameters assessed included pathologic microbial organism, clinical presentation, treatment, complications, prognostic factors, and visual outcomes. METHODS: Information was collected on microbiology, treatment, visual outcomes, and complications.Median age was 61.6 years and 32 subjects (51.6%) were male. Diabetes was the most common risk factor seen in 24 (38.7%) subjects. 17 subjects (27.4%) presented directly to ophthalmology and 17.4% had an initial misdiagnosis. 49 subjects (79.0%) presented with reduced vision and only 27 (43.5%) presented with pain. Hypopyon was present in 13 eyes (16.7%). Gram-positive bacteria were the most common causative organism seen in 40 (51.3%) eyes, followed by yeast and fungi in 21 (26.9%) eyes, then gram-negative bacteria seen in 17 (21.8%) eyes. Median final BCVA was18. Severe vision loss occurred in 33 (42.3%) eyes and(9.0%) eyes required evisceration or enucleation. Presenting visual acuity was a significant predictor of visual outcome.

Methods: Preterm infants born 2000 grams birth weight (BW) and or 34 weeks gestational age (GA) undergoing ROP screening were enrolled prospectively. Visual acuity was recorded using Teller Acuity Cards. Contrast threshold was measured with Newborn Contrast Cards at first screening visit and at the end of ROP screening at 40 weeks of postmenstrual age or older.Of the 173 study infants, 134 (77.5%) did not have any stage of ROP. Of the remaining 39 (22.5%), 34 (87%) had typeROP and(13%) had typeROP requiring treatment. The mean contrast threshold at the first visit of the no ROP typeand typegroups was 0.36 0.07, 0.65 0.19, and 0.46 0.09, respectively (P 0.001). Contrast threshold had a significant correlation with BW (R -0.291,0.001) and gestational age (R -0.47,0.001). The contrast threshold at the first visit correlated with visual acuity measured atmonths of corrected age in logMAR (R 0.36,0.01). Other than BW and GA, no other systemic risk factors correlated with contrast threshold measured at the first screening visit.Newborn Contrast Cards are a viable tool to test contrast threshold in preterm infants.

Interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted from one-to-one interviews with nine adolescents who received BA, generating an idiographic account of their experiences. Three superordinate themes emerged: how the format of BA can promote the integration of coping skills into one's life how interpersonal connections and therapeutic relationships may improve intervention outcomes and how BA principles could be internalised as part of a young person's day-to-day life. Participants valued the structure and flexibility of the manualised approach, forming an alliance with the therapist, and enhancing interpersonal relationships.

"Turalska, M.; Swami, A.",Greedy control of cascading failures in interdependent networks,"Complex systems are challenging to control because the system responds to the controller in a nonlinear fashion, often incorporating feedback mechanisms. Interdependence of systems poses additional difficulties, as cross-system connections enable malicious activity to spread between layers, increasing systemic risk. In this paper we explore the conditions for an optimal control of cascading failures in a system of interdependent networks. Specifically, we study the Bak Tang Wiesenfeld sandpile model incorporating a control mechanism, which affects the frequency of cascades occurring in individual layers. This modification allows us to explore sandpile-like dynamics near the critical state, with supercritical region corresponding to infrequent large cascades and subcritical zone being characterized by frequent small avalanches. Topological coupling between networks introduces dependence of control settings adopted in respective layers, causing the control strategy of a given layer to be influenced by choices made in other connected networks. We find that the optimal control strategy for a layer operating in a supercritical regime is to be coupled to a layer operating in a subcritical zone, since such condition corresponds to reduced probability of inflicted avalanches. However this condition describes a parasitic relation, in which only one layer benefits. Second optimal configuration is a mutualistic one, where both layers adopt the same control strategy.

Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is frequently caused by systemic risk factors posing hypercoagulable states. In April 2020, a female patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease presented withdays of loose, watery stools, nasal congestion and severe lethargy. The patient denied dyspnoea or fever. A week after the initial symptoms, the patient reported decreased vision from the left eye. Dilated funduscopy and fluorescein angiography suggested hemi-CRVO. The patient refused intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor agents because of non-severe visual loss. Testing was positive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies reverse transcription PCR was not available. Vision improved withinweeks of presentation.

"Sahinoglu-Keskek, N.; Sermet, F.",Impact of ocular and systemic risk factors on progression of geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration,"Geographic atrophy (GA) corresponds to an end-stage form of age-related macular degeneration and the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) patterns surrounding GA, baseline GA size, the presence of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), the condition of the fellow eye and the presence of systemic vascular diseases (diabetes, atherosclerosis, systemic hypertension) on the progression of GA due to age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: Seventy-five eyes of 52 patients with GA were included into this retrospective study. Digital FAF images were achieved using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Areas of GA were measured with the Region Finder software program on an Heidelberg Retinal Angiograph 2. FAF patterns around GA were classified and the presence of RPD and systemic diseases were noted. The median follow-up of the patients was 2.6 years (interquartile range, 1-9.2).The median progression rate of the banded pattern (median 0.97 mm2 year) was significantly higher than the other patterns (median 0.85 mm2 year) (p 0.03). Eyes with RPD had a significantly higher progression rate (median 1.21 mm2 year) than those without RPD (median 0.79 mm2 year) (p 0.007).

"Shanmugam, P.M.; Shah, P.; Ramanjulu, R.; Mishra, D.",Impact of systemic parameters before commencing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for diabetic macular edema pan-indian survey of retina specialists,"PURPOSE: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection therapy has emerged as the mainstay of treatment in the management of diabetic macular edema (DME) today. Various systemic risk factors have to be considered before initiating anti-VEGF therapy. The aim of our study was to form a consensus on various systemic factors to consider before starting anti-VEGF therapy for DME. METHODS: A questionnaire was created and sent across to various retina specialists across India. A GoogleTM form with various questions pertaining to what systemic parameters would one consider before giving anti-VEGF therapy for DME was sent to each of them by email WhatsAppTM direct telephonic interview.Of the 650 retina specialists contacted, 322 responded to the questionnaire. There was no difference in responses between private and institutional practitioners. The majority would consider RBS (85%), HbA1c (61%), blood pressure (63%), and renal function (57%) as a routine before administering the anti-VEGF injection, while the majority would not consider hemoglobin (63%) or lipid profile (55%) of the patient as a routine practice prior to administering the injection. CONCLUSION: In our study, most VR specialists prefer to consider RBS, HbA1c, BP, and renal profile (creatinine) routinely prior to anti-VEGF injection. We suggest that it is important to consider blood pressure control, glycemic control, HbA1c, Hb, lipid profile, and renal profile (UACR, eGFR, and creatinine) prior to anti-VEGF therapy in all diabetic patients and to discuss the need for statins in patients with dyslipidemias with the physician.",2021,2021-10-29,0,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,angiogenesis inhibitors; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; humans; intravitreal injections; macular edema; ranibizumab; retina; surveys and questionnaires; vascular endothelial growth factor a,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Shanmugam, P.M.

We designed an observational cohort study to provide up-to-date data for policy makers and clinical researchers on incidence of key screening endpoints in people with diabetes attending one screening programme running for over 30 years. METHODS: All people with diabetes aged 12 years registered with general practices in the Liverpool health district were offered inclusion. Data sources comprised: primary care (demographics, systemic risk factors), Liverpool Diabetes Eye Screening Programme (retinopathy grading), Hospital Eye Services (slit lamp biomicroscopy assessment of screen positives).133,366 screening episodes occurred in 28,384 people over 11 years. Overall incidences were: screen positive 6.7% (95% CI 6.5-6.8), screen positive for retinopathy 3.1% (3.0-3.1), unassessable images 2.6% (2.5-2.7), other significant eye diseases 1.0% (1.0-1.1). 1.6% (1.6-1.7) had sight-threatening retinopathy confirmed by slit lamp biomicroscopy. The annual incidence of screen positive and screen positive for retinopathy showed consistent declines from 8.8%-10.6% and 4.4%-4.6% in 2007 09 to 4.4%-6.8% and 2.3%-2.9% in 2013 17, respectively. Rates of STDR (true positive) were consistently below 2% after 2008 09. Screen positive rates were higher in first time attenders (9.9% 9.4-10.2 vs. 6.1% 6.0-6.2in part due to ungradeable images (4.1% vs. 2.3%) and other eye disease (2.4% vs. 0.8%). 4.5% (3.9-5.2) of previous non-attenders had sight-threatening retinopathy. Compared with people with typediabetes, those with typedisease demonstrated higher rates of screen positive (11.9% vs. 6.0%) and STDR (6.4% vs. 1.2%). Overall prevalence of any retinopathy was 27.2% (27.0-27.4).In an established screening programme with a stable population screen, positive rates show a consistent fall over time to a low level. Of those who are screen positive, fewer than 50% are screen positive for diabetic retinopathy. Most are due to sight threatening maculopathy. The annual incidence of STDR is under 2% suggesting future work on redefining screen positive and supporting extended intervals for people at low risk.

"Bek, T.; Nielsen, M.S.; Klug, S.E.; Eriksen, J.E.",Increasing metabolic variability increases the risk for vitrectomy in proliferative diabetic retinopathy,"PurposeProliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can be treated by retinal photocoagulation, but in some cases, the treatment is initiated too late or is insufficient so that the disease advances to a stage requiring vitrectomy. There is a need to identify risk factors that can predict if patients with PDR will develop complications in need for vitrectomy.MethodsSurvival analysis with death as competing risk was used to study systemic risk factors for PDR progression to a complication in need for vitrectomy in right eyes of all 1288 diabetic patients from the Aarhus area, Denmark, who had developed proliferative retinopathy in the right eye during the 25 years period fromJuly 1994 untilJuly 2019.The overall cumulative incidence of reaching a vitrectomy end point in the right eye was 24.1% (n 311). In 9.3% (n 120) of the patients where vitrectomy had been performed together with the first photocoagulation, the age of onset of diabetes was significantly higher (p 0.0001), the diabetes duration longer (p 0.035) and BMI higher (p 0.01) than in the patients who had been vitrectomized later than the first photocoagulation. The risk for vitrectomy was significantly increased by high variability of HbA1c before the development of PDR (p 0.0001), but not by other parameters known to increase the risk for developing PDR.ConclusionIncreasing variability of HbA1c before the development of PDR increases the risk for progression to a complication in need of vitrectomy. The need for vitrectomy is unaffected by other risk factors known to increase the risk for developing PDR.",2021,2021-10-08,1,International Ophthalmology,"diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; humans; light coagulation; retina; vitrectomy; vitreoretinopathy, proliferative",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Bek, T.

"Kumar, A.; Raj, A.",Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome: an updated review of literature,"Intraoperative Floppy iris syndrome(IFIS) remains a challenge for surgeons during phacoemulsification. Initially, it was related to the use of tamsulosin, an alpha adrenergic receptor blocker used in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Subsequently, other alpha adrenergic receptor such as alfuzosin, terazosin and doxazosin alongwith different other class of medications and systemic risk factors were identified. Other class of medications includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and antidepressants. Other risk factors include increasing age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension and decreased preoperative pupil diameter. It is very important for surgeons to identify these risk factors preoperatively and take appropriate preoperative and intraoperative measures to tackle the dreaded complications of IFIS. Sometimes, it is important for an ophthalmologist to work in cooperation with physician and urologist to minimize the complications. In conclusion, awareness of the risk factors associated with IFIS, their detailed preoperative assessment and intraoperative measures and surgical intervention is crucial in addressing IFIS.

Non-invasive retinal fundus imaging enables evaluation of the microvascular network and may offer insight to systemic risk associated with CKD.MethodsRetinal microvascular parameters (fractal dimension FD a measure of the complexity of the vascular network, tortuosity, and retinal arteriolar and venular calibre) were quantified from macula-centred fundus images using the Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the REtina (VAMPIRE) version 3.1 (VAMPIRE group, Universities of Dundee and Edinburgh, Scotland) and assessed for associations with renal damage in a case-control study nested within the multi-centre UK Biobank cohort study. Participants were designated cases or controls based on urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) thresholds. Participants with ACR mg mmol (ACR stages A2-A3) were characterised as cases, and those with an ACR mg mmol (ACR stage A1) were categorised as controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 498 digital questionnaires were collected and 358 complete responses of French dental practionners in active practice except for orthodontists were analyzed. Descriptive analysis was computed and categorical variables were compared bytest. The independence of the compared variables was tested by χ2 test. The scores obtained to the knowledge questions were compared by Mann-Whitney's tests depending on age, gender and year of graduation.84% of the respondents routinely record antiresorptive medication history in the medical chart. Therefore, almost all the practitioners know the importance to report in anamnesis the use of BRIs, but we noticed some contradictions: Less than half of the respondents recognized the brand names of BRIs and their indications. The combination of BRIs with other drugs like antiangiogenic or corticosteroid therapies is identified as a MRONJ systemic risk factor by respectively 46,3% and 29,7% of the respondents. Likewise, only 43,2% of the practitioners identified removable dentures as a local risk factor. We showed that practitioners under 30 years old and or who graduated for less than 10 years reached a significantly higher score putting university as the main source of information on that subject.

"Lim, J.I.; Niec, M.; Sun, J.; Cao, D.",Longitudinal assessment of retinal thinning in adults with and without sickle cell retinopathy using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography,"Importance: Determination of retinal thinning rates may help to identify patients who are at risk of progression of sickle cell retinopathy.To assess the rates of macular thinning in adults with and without sickle cell retinopathy using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to identify ocular and systemic risk factors associated with retinal thinning. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal prospective case-control study enrolled adult participants from a university-based retina subspecialty clinic between February 11, 2009, and July 3, 2019. The study was designed in autumn 2008 and conducted from February 2, 2009, to July 3, 2020. Participants with sickle cell retinopathy (sickle cell group) were matched by age and race with participants without sickle cell retinopathy (control group). Participants received annual spectral-domain OCT and clinical examinations. Those with at leastyear of follow-up by July 3, 2020, were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from February 2, 2009, to July 3, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was comparison of spectral-domain OCT measurements from early-treatment diabetic retinopathy study subfield rates of retinal thinning between eyes with and without sickle cell retinopathy and between different sickle cell hemoglobin subtypes. The secondary outcome was identification of ocular and systemic risk factors associated with rates of retinal thinning.Among 370 adults (711 eyes) enrolled in the study, 310 participants (606 eyes) had sickle cell retinopathy, and 60 participants (105 eyes) did not. Of those, 175 of 310 participants (56.5% 344 of 606 eyes 56.8% mean SD age, 37.8 12.8 years 126 women 72.0%in the sickle cell group and 31 of 60 participants (51.7% 46 of 105 eyes 43.8% mean SD age, 59 15.4 years 22 women 71.0%in the control group had at leastyear of clinical and spectral-domain OCT follow-up data from baseline. The mean (SD) follow-up was 53.7 (32.6) months for the sickle cell group and 54.6 (34.9) months for the control group. Rates of macular thinning in the sickle cell group were significantly higher than those in the control group for the inner nasal (difference, -1.18 μm per year 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.65 μm per year), inner superior (difference, -1.03 μm per year 95% CI, -1.78 to -0.29 μm per year), inner temporal (difference, -0.61 μm per year 95% CI, -1.16 to -0.07 μm per year), and outer nasal (difference, -0.41 μm per year 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.03 μm per year) quadrants. Patients with sickle cell hemoglobin SC and sickle cell hemoglobin β-thalassemia subtypes had higher rates of retinal thinning than those with the sickle cell hemoglobin SS subtype. Risk factors associated with greater rates of retinal thinning included participant age, stage of retinopathy, previous stroke, and presence of hypertension, acute chest syndrome, or diabetes. Hydroxyurea therapy was associated with decreased rates of retinal thinning and may be a protective factor. and Relevance: In this study, rates of retinal thinning were higher among participants with sickle cell retinopathy compared with those without sickle cell retinopathy, and thinning rates increased with participant age and stage of retinopathy. These findings suggest that identifying anatomic worsening of sickle cell maculopathy through spectral-domain OCT may be a useful parameter to evaluate the progression of sickle cell retinopathy.",2021,2021-03-01,7,Jama Ophthalmology,"adult; anemia, sickle cell; case-control studies; disease progression; female; follow-up studies; humans; macula lutea; male; prospective studies; retinal diseases; tomography, optical coherence; visual acuity",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Lim, J.I.

Here, we show that a machine trained to dismantle relatively small systems is able to identify higher-order topological patterns, allowing to disintegrate large-scale social, infrastructural and technological networks more efficiently than human-based heuristics. Remarkably, the machine assesses the probability that next attacks will disintegrate the system, providing a quantitative method to quantify systemic risk and detect early-warning signals of system’s collapse. This demonstrates that machine-assisted analysis can be effectively used for policy and decision-making to better quantify the fragility of complex systems and their response to shocks.",2021,2021-08-31,30,Nature Communications,,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,"Grassia, M.

"Yu, H.; Zhou, A.; Liu, J.; Tang, Y.; Yuan, Q.; Man, Y.; Xiang, L.",Management of systemic risk factors ahead of dental implant therapy: A beard well lathered is half shaved,"As the most successful therapy for missing teeth, dental implant has become increasingly prevalent around the world. A lot of papers have reported diverse local risk factors affecting the success and survival rate of dental implants, either for a short or a long period. However, there are also many types of systemic disorders or relatively administrated medicine that may jeopardize the security and success of dental implant treatment. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic also poses a challenge to dental implant clinicians. Some of these risk factors are clinically common but to some extent unfamiliar to dentists, thus optimal measurements are often lacking when they occur in dental clinics. In this review, we analyze potential systemic risk factors that may affect the success rate of dental implants. Some of them may affect bone mineral density or enhance the likelihood of local infection, thus impeding osseointegration. Others may even systemically increase the risk of the surgery and threaten patients' life. In order to help novices receive high-risk patients who need to get dental implant treatment in a more reasonable way, we accordingly review recent research and clinical experiments to discuss promising precautions, such as stopping drugs that impact bone mineral density or the operation, and addressing any perturbations on vital signs.",2021,2021-07-07,2,Journal of Leukocyte Biology,bone density; dental implants; dental restoration failure; humans; osseointegration; risk factors,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Yu, H.

Although the pandemic has been unprecedented in scale and type, such complex, compounding shocks are not uncommon and are more likely in our modern, interconnected world. Our ability to assess and anticipate compounding risks is limited. Here, we propose a framework for assessing the economic losses associated with compounding climate, economic, and pandemic shocks. We propose a new metric, the compound risk multiplier, to measure the scale of the amplification effect and find that this can peak at over 150% that is, the GDP impacts of the compound shock can be 50% larger than the sum of the individual shocks.

By using the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressions (TVP-VAR) approach, we show that the overall connectedness between the returns for financial assets increased during the COVID-19 period. Our static analysis shows that the behavior of the majority of NFT returns is attributable to endogenous shocks and only a small portion of this variation resulted from the impact of innovation in other assets. The suggest that NFTs are mainly independent of shocks from common assets classes and even from their close relation, Ethereum. The dynamic analysis across time reveals that during normal times, NFTs act as transmitters of systemic risk to some degree, but during stressful times, their role shifts, and they act as absorbers of risk spillovers. This suggests that NFTs may have diversification benefits during turbulent times, as apparent during the COVID-19 crisis, and especially around the great March 2020 market plunge.",2021,2021-10-29,75,Finance Research Letters,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Aharon, D.Y.

"Samal, A.; Pharasi, H.K.; Ramaia, S.J.; Kannan, H.; Saucan, E.; Jost, J.; Chakraborti, A.",Network geometry and market instability,"The complexity of financial markets arise from the strategic interactions among agents trading stocks, which manifest in the form of vibrant correlation patterns among stock prices. Over the past few decades, complex financial markets have often been represented as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are stocks, connected by edges that signify the correlation strengths. However, we often have interactions that occur in groups of three or more nodes, and these cannot be described simply by pairwise interactions but we also need to take the relations between these interactions into account. Only recently, researchers have started devoting attention to the higher-order architecture of complex financial systems, that can significantly enhance our ability to estimate systemic risk as well as measure the robustness of financial systems in terms of market efficiency. Geometry-inspired network measures, such as the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature, can be used to capture the network fragility and continuously monitor financial dynamics. Here, we explore the utility of such discrete Ricci curvatures in characterizing the structure of financial systems, and further, evaluate them as generic indicators of the market instability. For this purpose, we examine the daily returns from a set of stocks comprising the USAP-500 and the Japanese Nikkei-225 over a 32-year period, and monitor the changes in the edge-centric network curvatures. We find that the different geometric measures capture well the system-level features of the market and hence we can distinguish between the normal or 'business-as-usual' periods and all the major market crashes. This can be very useful in strategic designing of financial systems and regulating the markets in order to tackle financial instabilities.",2021,2021-02-24,16,Royal Society Open Science,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Samal, A.

Maxillary osteomyelitis risk is low owing to its high vascularity. This study was undertaken to evaluate risk factors, presentation, management and outcomes of maxillary osteomyelitis caused due to reasons other than irradiation and bone remodelling drugs. Methods: Patient records diagnosed with maxillary osteomyelitis were evaluated for demographic details, risk factors, clinical presentation, radiological features, treatment performed and outcomes.In 38 patients with non-irradiated and non-drug-induced osteomyelitis, 13 involved the maxilla, seven were localized to the posterior maxilla and 10 showed paranasal sinus involvement. Dissemination to the cavernous sinus and cerebral spread was seen in one. Clinical findings included oroantral communication, pain and draining sinus. Imaging showed diffuse bone destruction areas with or without evidence of bony sequestrum. The most common systemic risk factor was diabetes mellitus. Maxillary osteomyelitis was associated with tooth extraction in eight cases. Surgical management included debridement, sequestrectomy, functional endoscopic sinus surgery, maxillectomy and reconstruction of soft tissue defect with local and regional flaps. Complete recovery was seen in 11 patients. Mortality was seen in two patients with mucormycosis having disseminated infection. Conclusion: Compared with previous literature, a relatively higher ratio of maxillary involvement was reported.

We identified 11 factors that increase the risk of glaucoma: hyperlipidemia, nocturnal dip in blood pressure, infection with Helicobacter pylori, myopia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, corneal properties, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, migraine, and plasma homocysteine. We identifiedfactors that reduce the risk of glaucoma: dietary intake of vitamin A, dietary intake of vitamin C, and short-term statin use. We identifiedfactors that had no association with glaucoma: dietary intake of vitamin B, dietary intake of vitamin E, cigarette smoking, Alzheimer's disease, serum folic acid, serum vitamin B6, serum vitamin B12, and serum vitamin D.In this umbrella review of MAs, evidence was found for associations of various nonocular factors with glaucoma to different degrees.

Patients were grouped according to the presence of thalassemia-related retinal changes. The association between systemic risk factors (age, type and duration of iron chelator use, history of splenectomy, hemoglobin level, and ferritin level) and thalassemia-related retinal changes was investigated using logistic regression analysis.Thalassemia-related retinal changes were identified in 36.7% of patients. Several distinct retinal changes were observed, including retinal refractile bodies in 10% of patients and retinal hemorrhage in 5.8% of patients. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed abnormal patterns in 36.3% of patients with thalassemia-related retinal changes and 18.4% of patients without thalassemia-related retinal changes.

"Duffy, M.B.",Now is the time to redefine safety in healthcare,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare workers around the globe provided exceptional patient care despite fears of infection, shortages of staff and supplies, and the frustrations of trying to treat a novel pathogen. At the same time, COVID-19 exposed deep and systemic risks to healthcare team members' physical, psychological, and emotional safety driving burnout to crisis levels. Burnout is arising not only from the emotional toll of caring for sick and dying patients, but COVID-19 also exposed flaws in our health system and infrastructure. Systemic inequities were amplified as COVID-19 disproportionately impacted people of colour and Indigenous community members. A renewed and expanded definition of safety is needed to restore trust, recruit, and retain individuals to the healing professions, enable care to be provided with the greatest skill and humanity, and ensure the well-being of every person working in healthcare. In collaboration with CEOs of a diverse group of health systems in the United States, the author drafted a Declaration of Principles that expands the definition of safety to include safeguarding psychological and emotional well-being of team members, promoting health justice by declaring equity and anti-racism as core components of safety, and ensuring physical safety, which includes a zero-harm program to eliminate workplace violence, both physical and verbal. We invite Canadian leaders to embrace these concepts and commit to supporting team member safety and well-being as an essential foundation for public health.

We construct dynamic total, net total and net pairwise return and volatility connectedness measures to better understand systemic risk and the transmission of shocks across REIT markets. Our findings show that that REIT market interdependence is dynamic and increases significantly during times of heightened uncertainty, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We also find that the US REIT market along with major European REITs are generally sources of shocks to Asian-Pacific REIT markets. Furthermore, US REITs appear to dominate European REITs.

OCT studies have identified key features of plaque vulnerability and described the in vivo characteristics and spatial distribution of thin cap fibroatheromas as major precursors to plaque rupture. In addition, OCT data supports the evolving understanding of coronary heart disease as a panvascular process associated with inflammation. In the setting of high atherosclerotic burden, plaque ruptures often occur at multiple sites in the coronary arteries, and plaque progression and healing are dynamic processes modulated by systemic risk factors.

OCTA was conducted with the 4.5 4.5-mm scan pattern centered on the optic nerve head, and the RPC density and peripapillary RNFL thickness were quantified.The peripapillary RNFL in the RVO fellow eyes was significantly thinner than in normal controls in the average, inferior-hemisphere, inferior quadrant, and temporal quadrant (P 0.05, respectively). The RPC density in the fellow eyes was also significantly lower in the average, inferior-hemisphere, nasal quadrant, and temporal quadrant ((P 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in RNFL thickness and RPC density between branch RVO fellow eyes and central RVO fellow eyes. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between the RPC density and RNFL thickness in all measurements (P 0.001, respectively).The regional RPC density was reduced in the RVO fellow eyes, which might contribute to peripapillary RNFL thinning in the corresponding region, suggesting the influence of systemic risk factors on RVO.

METHODS: Diagnosis of CRAO between January 1, 1976, and September 9, 2016, was identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a medical records linkage system for all medical care provided to residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota. Records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of CRAO, and data were collected on ocular NV and associated systemic diseases.There were 89 patients with CRAO. Subsequent ocular neovascularization developed in 14 (16%) patients. Neovascularization of the iris (NVI) was present in14 (64%) of these patients, neovascularization of the angle (NVA) in 10 14 (71%), neovascularization of the disc (NVD) in14 (14%), and neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) in14 (7%). Of these 14 patients with NV,(64%) developed neovascular glaucoma (NVG). The mean time from CRAO diagnosis to NV was 82 days (range 22 to 268 days). Excluding the patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or CRAO caused by CRVO, the mean time to NV diagnosis was 80 days and the shortest time to NV diagnosis was 22 days. Diabetes mellitus was present in 64% of those with NV compared to 23% of those without NV (P 0.003).

"Aguirre, J.I.; Castillo, E.J.; Kimmel, D.B.",Preclinical models of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ),"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a potentially severe adverse event affecting patients with cancer and patients with osteoporosis who have been treated with powerful antiresorptives (pARs) or angiogenesis inhibitors (AgIs). pARs, including nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs e.g., zoledronic acid, alendronate) and anti-RANKL antibodies (e.g., denosumab), are used to manage bone metastases in patients with cancer or to prevent fragility fractures in patients with osteoporosis. Though significant advances have been made in understanding MRONJ, its pathophysiology is still not fully elucidated. Multiple species have been used in preclinical MRONJ research, including the rat, mouse, rice rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, and pig. Animal research has contributed immensely to advancing the MRONJ field, particularly, but not limited to, in developing models and investigating risk factors that were first observed in humans. MRONJ models have been developed using clinically relevant doses of systemic risk factors, like N-BPs, anti-RANKL antibodies, or AgIs. Specific local oral risk factors first noted in humans, including tooth extraction and inflammatory dental disease (e.g., periodontitis, periapical infection, etc.), were then added. Research in rodents, particularly the rat, and, to some extent, the mouse, across multiple laboratories, has contributed to establishing multiple relevant and complementary preclinical models. Models in larger species produced accurate clinical and histopathologic outcomes suggesting a potential role for confirming specific crucial findings from rodent research. We view the current state of animal models for MRONJ as good. The rodent models are now reliable enough to produce large numbers of MRONJ cases that could be applied in experiments testing treatment modalities. The course of MRONJ, including stageMRONJ, is characterized well enough that basic studies of the molecular or enzyme-level findings in different MRONJ stages are possible. This review provides a current overview of the existing models of MRONJ, their more significant features and findings, and important instances of their application in preclinical research.",2021,2021-09-11,15,Bone,"animals; bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw; bone density conservation agents; bone neoplasms; denosumab; diphosphonates; disease models, animal; dogs; humans; mice; rabbits; rats; sheep; swine",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Aguirre, J.I.

Individuals diagnosed with (n 2046) and without (n 8184) serious complications after cataract surgery were matched 1:4 for age, sex, and index date obtained using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The outcome was defined as at least one new inpatient or outpatient diagnosis of systemic disease one year before the index date. The effect of demographic data on postoperative complications was also analyzed in the multivariable model. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals of the risk of developing serious complications. After the entire study interval, the major postoperative complications of cataract surgery were associated with the following systemic diseases: hypertension (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.329,0.001), diabetes mellitus (aOR 2.818,0.001), hyperlipidemia (aOR 1.702,0.001), congestive heart failure (aOR 2.891,0.001), rheumatic disease (aOR 1.965,0.001), and kidney disease needing hemodialysis (aOR 2.942,0.001). Additionally, demographic data including old age, higher urbanization level, higher level of care, and more frequent inpatient department visits were associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications. In conclusion, metabolic syndrome, chronic heart failure, end-stage renal disease, rheumatic disease, older age, and frequent inpatient department visits are correlated with the development of severe postoperative complications of cataract surgery. Therefore, cataract surgery patients should be informed about a higher possibility of postoperative complications.",2021,2021-07-28,3,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Lin, I.

Whereas optimal oral health prior to initiate pARs is recognized as critically important for minimizing ONJ risk, the efficacy of preventive maintenance measures in patients who are taking pARs is understudied. Rice rats fed a standard diet (STD), rich in insoluble fiber, develop localized periodontitis. STD-rats with localized periodontitis treated with ZOL for 18-24 wk develop ONJ. Hence, we hypothesized that controlling preventing localized periodontitis in the ZOL-treated rats, reduces ONJ occurrence. METHODS: We used two approaches to attempt reducing periodontitis prevalence: 1) periodontal cleaning (PC) and 2) replacing the STD-diet with a nutritionally-equivalent diet high in soluble fiber (SF). 75 four-week-old male rats were weight-randomized into five groups (n 15) in a 24-week experiment. Three groups ate the STD-diet and two the high SF-diet. STD-diet groups received intravenous (IV) vehicle (VEH) q4wks (STD VEH), 80 μg kg ZOL q4wks IV (STD ZOL), or ZOL plus PC q2wks (STD ZOL PC). The SF-diet groups received VEH (SF VEH) or ZOL (SF ZOL). Jaws were processed for histopathology and evaluated for ONJ prevalence and tissue-level periodontitis.1) 40% of STD VEH rats developed maxillary localized periodontitis with no ONJ 2) 50% of STD ZOL rats developed ONJ 3) 7% of STD ZOL PC rats developed ONJ (p 0.01 vs. STD ZOL) and 4) one SF ZOL rat developed localized periodontitis, and no SF VEH or SF ZOL rats developed ONJ (p 0.001 vs. STD ZOL).1) Periodontal cleaning in ZOL-treated rats decreases localized periodontitis severity and reduces ONJ prevalence and 2) feeding a SF-diet to ZOL-treated rats reduces both incidence of localized periodontitis and ONJ.

Treatment with carotid endarterectomy helps to restore cerebral perfusion, which may prevent ocular and cerebral complications. The main aim was to assess retinal and choroidal vascular perfusion changes before and after endarterectomy in patients affected by CAS. METHODS: The design of the study was prospective and observational, including patients affected by CAS and healthy controls. The follow-up wasmonths. We performed quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography (OCTA) analyses of retinal perfusion changes, before and after endarterectomy. The main outcome measures were the quantitative changes of choroidal thickness (CT), retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) vessel density (VD) and vessel tortuosity (VT) OCTA metrics were also measured.Sixty eyes of 30 patients affected by CAS and 30 eyes of 30 controls were included. We separately considered the ipsilateral eyes to CAS, the contralateral eyes to CAS, and the healthy eyes. Visual symptoms were absent in all the patients. RNFL and GCL resulted similar between patients and controls (p 0.05). CT was significantly thinner in ipsilateral eyes than controls (p 0.05). VD resulted significantly altered only in some plexa of the ipsilateral eyes (p 0.01), whereas VT disclosed decreased values of the entire retinal vascular network, both in ipsilateral and contralateral eyes (p 0.05).

METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional observational study was performed on patients diagnosed with MetS and compared to normal controls. All patients underwent ophthalmic and anthropometric examination, serological and biochemical blood investigations and ocular imaging using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Patients with ocular pathology were excluded. Unpaired t-test was used to compare mean thickness between the two groups. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to compare mean thickness between different tertiles of MetS parameters, and a generalized estimating equation was used to correct for inter-eye correlation and to assess association between mean thickness and covariates.Two hundred and forty-eight eyes from 124 participants (1:1 ratio of MetS patients to controls) were included. Age ranged between 30 to 50 years old, and mean age was 40 6.6 years. RNFL thickness was lower globally (93.6 9.9 μm vs 99.0 9.3,0.001) and in the inferior (124.5 17.5 μm vs 131.0 16.4 μm,0.002), superior (117.2 16.0 μm vs 126.3 14.4 μm,0.001) and temporal (65.5 10.2 μm vs 69.5 9.8,0.002) sectors in MetS patients compared to controls. Only the central (237.0 14.0 μm vs 243.6 18.0 μm,0.002) and inferior parafoveal (307.8 20.9 vs 314.6 14.6,0.004) area of the macula was significantly thinner. The inferior RNFL sector had the most difference (mean difference 9.1 μm). The Generalized Estimating Equation found that, after adjusting for age, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, HDL and obesity the number of MetS components and elevated triglyceride levels were independent risk factors for reduced thickness in global RNFL (β -4.4, 95% CI -7.29 to -1.5,0.003) and inferior parafovea (β -6.85, 95% CI -11.58 to -2.13,0.004) thickness respectively. CONCLUSION: RNFL thinning was seen more than macula thinning in MetS patients, suggesting RNFL susceptibility to neurodegeneration than the macula.

"Fan, H.; Liu, R.",Research on financial systemic risk in ASEAN region,"The research of financial systemic risk is an important issue, however the research on the financial systemic risk in ASEAN region lacks. This paper uses the minimum density method to calculate the interbank network of ASEAN countries and uses the node centrality to judge the systemically important banks of various countries. Then the DebtRank algorithm is constructed to calculate the systemic risk value based on the interbank network. By comparing the systemic risk values obtained through the initial impact on the system important banks and non-important banks, we find that the systemic risk tends to reach the peak in the case of the initial impact on the system important banks. Furthermore, it is found that countries with high intermediary centrality and closeness centrality have higher systemic risk. It suggests that the regulatory authorities should implement legal supervision, strict supervision, and comprehensive supervision for key risk areas and weak links.",2021,2021-08-31,2,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Fan, H.

"Fan, H.; Feng, L.; Zhou, R.",Research on systemic risk of the turkish banking industry based on a systemic risk measurement framework of the fractional brownian motion,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, it is an important issue to assess the systemic risk of banks, but there is a lack of research on the assessment of the systemic risk of Turkey’s financial system. In addition, geometric Brownian motion is used in most of the assessment frameworks of systemic risk under the normal financial market state, while the Turkish financial market has the situation of spike and thick tail. Therefore, this paper proposes a fractional Brownian motion measurement framework of systemic risk to study the systemic risk of the Turkish financial system. Firstly, this paper uses the data of 11 Turkish listed banks from 2014 to 2019 to conduct a normality test and demonstrate that its market has the characteristics of a fractal market that is, there is a spike and thick tail distribution phenomenon in the stock price trend. Then, this paper proposes a fractional Brownian motion systemic risk measurement framework (fBSM). Based on the proposed theoretical framework and the actual data of Turkish listed banks from 2014 to 2019, a dynamically evolving Turkish banking network system is constructed to measure the systemic risk in the Turkish banking system. The research find that the systemic risk is the highest in 2017, which then improved and gradually recovered. In addition, when analyzing the sensitivity of the Hurst index, it shows that with the increase in Hurst index, the Hurst index elasticity of Turkish banks’ asset value increases gradually and the asset value also increases continuously. Hence, the Hurst index has a greater impact on asset value. Therefore, the measurement framework of systemic risk based on the fBSM can better monitor the systemic risk than the traditional geometric Brownian motion in the Turkish banking system.",2021,2021-10-31,1,Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics,"Fan, H.

"White, A.V.; Wambui, D.W.; Pokhrel, L.R.",Risk assessment of inhaled diacetyl from electronic cigarette use among teens and adults,"Diacetyl (C4H6O2) is a toxicant commonly found in electronic cigarettes (e-Cigs) as a flavoring component and an enhancer of e-juices. Lung injury in current and former workers in popcorn manufacturing suggests a possible association with diacetyl inhalation exposure. Although the number of e-Cig users continues to rise steadily among the teens and adults, the potential risk of pulmonary disease has not been characterized. A systematic review of the open literature identified bronchiolitis obliterans-a pathological inflammation resulting in fibrosis of the bronchioles leading to an irreversible limitation to airflow in lungs-as the primary outcome of diacetyl exposures. Following the deterministic United States National Research Council Environmental Protection Agency's risk assessment framework, that consists of four key steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterization, we estimated noncarcinogenic (systemic) risks using a Hazard Quotient (HQ) approach upon exposure to diacetyl among teens and adults who use e-Cigs. Based on the NIOSH Benchmark Dose (BMD 0.0175 mg kg-day) and modelled Average Daily Doses (ADDs range 0.11-5.2 mg kg-day), we estimated 12 different HQ values-a measure of non-carcinogenic risk for diacetyl inhalation exposures-all of which were greater than(range 6.2875-297.1429), suggesting a significantly higher non-carcinogenic risk from diacetyl exposures among the teens and adults who use e-Cigs.

"Pokhrel, L.R.; Grady, K.D.",Risk assessment of occupational exposure to anesthesia isoflurane in the hospital and veterinary settings,"Despite the modern ventilation and waste anesthetic gas (WAG) scavenging systems, occupational exposure to common volatile anesthesia, isoflurane, can occur in the hospital and veterinary settings, but limited information exists on potential exposure and health risk of isoflurane. We assessed exposure dose rates and risks among clinicians and veterinary professionals from occupational exposure to isoflurane. Through a critical review of open literature (1965 to 2020), we summarized potential adverse effects and exposure scenarios of isoflurane among the professional groups, including anesthetists, nurses, operating room personnel, researchers, and or veterinarians. Deterministic United States National Research Council Environmental Protection Agency's risk assessment framework (hazard identification, dose-response relationship, exposure assessment and risk characterization) was used to compute inhalation Reference Doses (RfDs), Average Daily Doses (ADDs), and Hazard Quotient (HQ) values-an established measure of non-carcinogenic (systemic) risks-from exposure to isoflurane to workers in hospital and veterinary settings. We identified the central nervous system as the main target for isoflurane, and that isoflurane has dose-dependent effects on cardiac hemodynamics, can impair pulmonary functions and potentially cross the utero-placental barrier leading to congenital malformation in fetus. Based on the modelled RfDs (range 0.8003-7.55 mg kg-day) and ADDs (range 0.071-1.9617 mg kg-day), we estimated 56 different HQ values, of whichHQs were higher than(range 1.099-2.4512) under high exposure scenarios.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records for this retrospective, multicenter cohort study were randomly selected from eight private practices. The primary outcome variable was time to event (implant failure or last known follow-up). The included independent variables were age, sex, diabetes status, smoking status, and arch location. Analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards on three models: univariate, full multivariate, and systemic factor multivariate. The probability of implant survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was calculated using univariate time-to-event modeling on log-normal distribution with 95% CIs and Cox proportional hazard tests for significance. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was calculated for patients 71 years of age.Eight hundred thirty-five implant-level records from 378 patients were collected for analyses. The mean patient age was 60 years, and 48% were men, 15% reported a history of smoking, and 16% reported having diabetes. The follow-up time was as long as 17 years, with a mean of 23.1 months, and a median ofmonths. The hazard ratio (HR) for implant failure due to sex (HR 1.18 95% CI: 0.52 to 2.66), smoking (HR 1.30 95% CI: 0.49 to 3.46), diabetes (HR 1.17 95% CI: 0.35 to 3.86), and arch location (HR 2.13 to 3.39) failed to reach the threshold within any Cox proportional hazards model (P .05). CONCLUSION: The implant survival probability for patients 70 years of age is 86.4% at 10 years in the course of routine private practice by experienced providers. Cautious interpretation of these is critical, as the effects of known systemic risk factors are likely tempered by effective modifications in clinical decisions and protocols with short- and long-term follow-up maintenance.",2021,2021-03-01,4,the International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants,"child; cohort studies; dental implantation, endosseous; dental implants; dental restoration failure; female; humans; male; middle aged; private practice; proportional hazards models; retrospective studies; risk factors; survival analysis",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Schoenbaum, T.R.

This methodical approach allows for the analysis of various dynamics and persistence in the multivariate time series in terms of risk propagation. For instance, both the BG-SEMX and BG-VARX can reveal the within-day and across-day major risk transmitters as well as risk recipients from other univariate time series, which better explain risk contagion using complex network models. In addition, the procedures for models with and without exogenous variables have been explored, which shows that the former produce more network structures compared to the latter and therefore depict their influential role. This approach, therefore, provides a platform for future research in terms of extension of the method to encompass different types of multivariate data with additional innovations that might aid feasible analysis and the design of policy instruments and the implementation of relevant policy implications.

A dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive heteroscedastic (DCC- GARCH) model is employed to estimate three important measures of tail dependence risk: conditional value at risk (CoVaR), delta CoVaR (ΔCoVaR), and marginal expected shortfall (MES). Using daily data from January 2017 until May 2020, point to significant systemic oil risk spillover in all GCC stock markets. In particular, the effect of oil price systemic risk on GCC stock market returns was significantly larger during COVID-19 than before the pandemic. Upon splitting COVID-19 into two phases based on severity, we identify Saudi Arabia as the only GCC market to have experienced significantly higher exposure to oil risk in Phase 1. Although all GCC stock markets received greater oil systemic risk spillover in Phaseof COVID-19, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appeared more vulnerable to oil extreme risk than other countries. Our empirical findings reveal that investors should carefully consider the extreme oil risk effects on GCC stock markets when designing optimal portfolio strategies, minimizing portfolio risk, and adopting dynamic diversification process.

In this paper, we first present how Canada experienced the pandemic. We then present how epidemiology and food safety oversight were affected by the virus and how the spread exposed gaps in Canada's food safety system. We explain how Canada was not adequately prepared to face the food safety challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2.

There are still few studies on the frequency of these cases. However, the cases that have come to public attention show that medical institutions bear systemic risk factors for such assaults. On the other hand, medical institutions also play an important role in child protection, since many children and adolescents affected by maltreatment including sexual abuse come into contact with the medical system. It is necessary that medical institutions deal with this problem and develop respective institutional protection concepts. A protection concept is a system of measures that ensure better protection against assaults within an organisation. Important steps are analysis of risk factors, structural changes, the creation of plan of procedures and the development of an institutional attitude that assaults are not tolerated. Although the development of protection concepts takes time and resources, it has many advantages for institutions, such as an increased sense of security for professionals, because they know how to proceed in such situation.

METHODS: Chinese adults aged 40 years and older were assessed at baseline andyears with colour fundus photography (CFP) and spectral domain (SD) OCT. CFPs were graded for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) features and drusen volume was generated using commercially available automated software.A total of 4172 eyes of 2580 participants (mean age 58.12 9.03 years 51.12% women) had baseline and 6-year follow-up CFP for grading, of these, 2130 eyes of 1305 participants had gradable SD-OCT images, available for analysis.

Conventional risks can be contained in space and time, follow linear cause-effect relationships and can be addressed with effective and pointed interventions into the cause-effect chain. Systemic risks, however, are characterized by high complexity, transboundary effects, stochastic relationships, nonlinear cause-effect patterns with tipping points, and are often associated with less public attention than they require. The article addresses the reasons why systemic risks seem to be attenuated in public perception. The article goes on to consider how the social amplification of risk framework is useful in the context of systemic risks and describes needed extensions of that framework. It identifies practical tools for assessing the significance of perceptions for systemic risk situations. Finally, it argues that a graphic representation and simulation of evolving systemic risks and potential countermeasures as well as a participatory deliberative approach of inclusive risk governance are suitable governance strategies for preventing, mitigating, or managing systemic risks.",2021,2021-10-02,9,Risk Analysis,risk management; social perception,44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,"Schweizer, P.

For the Covid-19 case, we model the initial shock based on the loss of labor between March and April 2020 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The industries within the network are assigned a resilience that determines the ability of an industry to absorb input losses, such that if the rate of input loss exceeds the resilience, the industry fails, and its outputs go to zero. We observed a critical resilience, such that, below this critical value, the network experienced a catastrophic cascade resulting in total network collapse.

The spread of the disease has also caused dramatic uncertainty in financial markets, especially in the early stages of the pandemic. In this paper, we adopt the stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to model dynamic longitudinal financial networks with the covariates constructed from the network statistics of COVID-19 dynamic pandemic networks. Our findings provide evidence that the transmission risk of the COVID-19, measured in the transformed pandemic risk scores, is a main explanatory factor of financial network connectedness from March to May 2020. The pandemic statistics and transformed pandemic risk scores can give early signs of the intense connectedness of the financial markets in mid-March 2020. We can make use of the SAOM approach to predict possible financial contagion using pandemic network statistics and transformed pandemic risk scores of the COVID-19 and other pandemics.",2021,2021-08-18,5,Stat,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics,"Chu, A.M.Y.

"Selvaraj, D.; Velvizhi, G.","Sustainable ecological engineering systems for the treatment of domestic wastewater using emerging, floating and submerged macrophytes","Water scarcity is perceived as a global systemic risk since there is an inexorable rise in water demand. An ecological engineering system mimics a natural ecosystem by balancing the trophic conditions for effective treatment of wastewater in a sequential manner. The present study was designed using emergent, floating and submerged macrophytic plants in a systematic approach. The study was evaluated with several components such as plants (water hyacinth, water lettuce and water thymes), aeration (supply of oxygen), and physical adsorption (activated carbon). Domestic wastewater collected from the local effluent treatment plant was treated individually and by combining all the components. Diverse experimental setups viz., lake sediment (control reactor), aeration, activated carbon blocks, water hyacinth, water lettuce, and water thymes were individually studied. Further the above components were combined, such as lake sediment aeration activated carbon blocks with plants like water hyacinth, water lettuce, and water thymes. The study inferred along with phytoremediation, and the external factors enhanced the treatment performances. Water hyacinth documented enhanced chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 85.71%, followed by water lettuce (80%), and water thymes (77.14%) along with the plants, both aeration, and activated carbon had stimulated the wastewater treatment. The highest removal efficiency of nitrate (70.23%), phosphate (63.64%), and sulphate (61.16%) were observed in water hyacinth due to its thick roots, and fibrous tissues reported effective treatment. The study hypothesized that these processes could be an effective strategy to restore the lakes and regulate the environmental flow.

"Welburn, J.W.; Strong, A.M.",Systemic cyber risk and aggregate impacts,"With some of the largest cyber attacks occurring in recent years-from 2010 to 2019-we are only beginning to understand the full extent of cyber risk. As businesses grapple with the risks of cyber-incidents and their imperfect ability to prevent them, attention has shifted toward risk management and insurance. While there have been efforts to understand the costs of cyber attacks, the systemic risk-a result of risks spreading across interdependent systems-associated with cyber attacks remains a critical and problem in need of further study. We contribute a theoretical framework that describes systemic cyber risk as the result of cascading, common cause, or independent failures following a cyber incident. We construct a quantitative model of cascading failures to estimate the potential economic damage associated with a given cyber incident. We present an interdisciplinary approach for extending standard sector-level input-output analyses to the cyber domain, which has not been done. We estimate the aggregate losses associated with firm-level incidents, a contribution to risk analysis and computational economic modeling. We use this model to estimate the impact of potential cyber incidents and compare model to a case with known damages. Finally, we use the model of systemic cyber failure to consider the implications on the growing cyber insurance market and the need for broader cyber policy. While we discuss the topic of systemic cyber risk, our contribution of usingO analysis to estimate the aggregate losses from firm-level incidents is applicable across a variety of risk analysis applications from environment to health.",2021,2021-02-16,6,Risk Analysis,commerce; computer security; risk assessment; risk management,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Welburn, J.W.

Drawing on documentary sources, 189 interviews with market participants, and fieldwork conducted at an algorithmic trading firm, we argue that automated markets are characterized by tight coupling and complex interactions, which render them prone to large-scale technological accidents, according to Perrow's normal accident theory. We suggest that the implementation of ideas from research into high-reliability organizations offers a way for trading firms to curb some of the technological risk associated with algorithmic trading. Paradoxically, however, certain systemic conditions in markets can allow individual firms' high-reliability practices to exacerbate market instability, rather than reduce it. We therefore conclude that in order to make automated markets more stable (and curb the impact of failures), it is important to both widely implement reliability-enhancing practices in trading firms and address the systemic risks that follow from the tight coupling and complex interactions of markets.",2021,2021-10-06,6,Social Studies of Science,accidents; humans; organizations; reproducibility of results; risk management,44 Human Society; 4401 Anthropology; 4410 Sociology; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,"Min, B.H.

First, we present the concept of systemic risk and current trends in systemic risk research. We then analyze contributions on systemic risk and food security. We first show that the literature has so far focused on a) agricultural production and correlated yield-losses, and on ways of pooling risk at regional or global-level, and b) the role of international trade in increasing or decreasing systemic risk. We then identify avenues for further research, highlighting the impact of intensive farming on ecosystems.

We find that core banks took positions against the periphery, increasing their systemic risk as a group. On the portfolio level, position similarity was the main systemic risk driver for core banks, while cross-price correlations drove the systemic risk of noncore banks. Core banks were more diversified, but their portfolios also overlapped more. By contrast, non-core banks were less diversified, but also overlapped less.

To identify the importance of business and consumer sentiment in this relation, a Kalman filter approach is adopted to extract the systemic risk-driven sentiment expectations. Our contributions are as follows. Systemic risk in the U.S. has a significant and negative impact on real GDP growth, and the channel of this impact is business and consumer sentiment. We illustrate that systemic risk is an important determinant of sentiment and sentiment expectations which, in turn, exercise a significant effect on GDP. These extend previous evidence on the impact of systemic risk on monthly measures of economic activity, and carry implications for recent research exploring systemic risk and sentiments as factors driving the macro-economy.

Many features that characterize and influence complex structures in nearly every domain of nature, technology, and society can be derived from simple modeling processes in physics and chemistry. If one applies these features to the structure of social risks, a number of insights are gained that can be subject to further empirical analysis. In particular, they add-to the well-known steering mechanisms of hierarchy, competition, and cooperation-the contribution of self-organization, the effect of which is underestimated in almost all theories of social science.

Pathological vascular remodeling, such as atherosclerosis and stenosis, largely develop at arterial sites of curvature, branching, and bifurcation, where disturbed blood flow activates vascular endothelium. Current pharmacological treatments of vascular complications principally target systemic risk factors. Improvements are needed. We previously devised a targeted polyelectrolyte complex micelle to deliver therapeutic nucleotides to inflamed endothelium in vitro by displaying the peptide VHPKQHR targeting vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM-1) on the periphery of the micelle. This paper explores whether this targeted nanomedicine strategy effectively treats vascular complications in vivo. Disturbed flow-induced microRNA-92a (miR-92a) has been linked to endothelial dysfunction. We have engineered a transgenic line (miR-92aEC-TG Apoe-) establishing that selective miR-92a overexpression in adult vascular endothelium causally promotes atherosclerosis in Apoe-mice. We tested the therapeutic effectiveness of the VCAM-1-targeting polyelectrolyte complex micelles to deliver miR-92a inhibitors and treat pathological vascular remodeling in vivo. VCAM-1-targeting micelles preferentially delivered miRNA inhibitors to inflamed endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic effectiveness of anti-miR-92a therapy in treating atherosclerosis and stenosis in Apoe-mice is markedly enhanced by the VCAM-1-targeting polyelectrolyte complex micelles.

Forty-six represented MRSA infections (46 7904 eye samples 0.58%), most occurring in older patients the majority of whom had known local or systemic risk factors for colonisation.

They learn over time to whom to reassign tasks and preferably choose agents with higher fitness. A lock-in occurs if reassignments can no longer adapt. Agents overwhelmed with tasks then fail, leading to failure cascades. We find that the probability for lock-ins and systemic failures increase with the heterogeneity in fitness values.

Rather than identifying risk factors for peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis, exploring the effect of these risk factors might be a promising method to improve the outcomes of thrombosis. S: To analyze the effect of systemic and local risk factors on triggering peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis in the first two weeks post-insertion in cancer patients. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a 4500-bed university-affiliated medical center in China. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-three cancer patients with peripherally inserted central catheters were included. METHODS: Peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis was assessed using ultrasound at a series of timepoints, once every two days post-insertion. Data on age, body mass index, blood hypercoagulation, insertion attempts, catheter-to-vein ratio, and blood flow velocity were collected as risk factors. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling were used to describe the study samples and analyze the effects of systemic and local risk factors.Among the 173 cancer patients included, 126 (72.8%) patients were diagnosed with peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis. Most thromboses (n 118, 93.7%) were detected within five days, and 100% were detected within nine days post-insertion. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that local risk factors catheter-to-vein ratio (standardized path coefficient 0.32,0.05) and blood flow velocity (standardized path coefficient -0.35,0.05) had a greater effect than systemic factors age (standardized path coefficient 0.13,0.05) and blood hypercoagulation (standardized path coefficient 0.17,0.05) on triggering peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis is quite common and can occur very early post-insertion in cancer patients. Among the common risk factors, local risk factors reflecting peripherally inserted central catheter technology itself had a greater effect than systemic risk factors reflecting predisposition to thrombosis.

CAS is a consequence of systemic atherosclerotic disease affecting the majority of the aging population. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel imaging technique for visualizing retinal blood flow. It is a noninvasive, fast method for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the microcirculation. Cerebral and retinal circulation share similar anatomy, physiology, and embryology thus, retinal microvasculature provides a unique opportunity to study the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease in vivo. In this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of systemic risk factors on retinal blood flow in the eyes of patients with significant carotid artery stenosis using OCT angiography. A total of 112 eyes of 56 patients with significant carotid stenosis were included in the study. We found that several systemic factors, such as decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hypertension, and carotid occlusion have a significant negative effect on retinal blood flow, while statin use and carotid surgery substantially improve ocular microcirculation. Neither diabetes, clopidogrel or acetylsalicylic acid use, BMI, serum lipid level, nor thrombocyte count showed a significant effect on ocular blood flow. Our demonstrate that a systematic connection does exist between certain systemic risk factors and retinal blood flow in this patient population. OCTA could help in the assessment of cerebral circulation of patients with CAS due to its ability to detect subtle changes in retinal microcirculation that is considered to represent changes in intracranial blood flow.",2021,2021-11-27,2,Geroscience,"aged; angiography; carotid stenosis; humans; microcirculation; retina; tomography, optical coherence",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"István, L.

Upon observing a higher frequency of CVST cases presenting to our hospital in summer, we hypothesized that CVST may be influenced by variations in climate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who were diagnosed with CVST at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan between January 2010 and December 2019 was conducted. After dividing patients into groups based on the type of risk, the frequency of CVST in these groups between four seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter) was compared.A total of 256 patients diagnosed with CVST were included, of which 129 were female and 127 were male. The mean age was 41.7 15.2 years. Of the total patients, 91.4% had some sort of risk factor, either systemic (162 patients) or local (72 patients), while 22 patients did not have any identifiable risk factor. The number of patients with more than one known risk factor was 93 (36.3%). Of the total number of patients, 96 (37.5%) patients had hyperhomocysteinemia, followed by 85 patients (33.2%) with a prothrombotic risk factor other than hyperhomocysteinemia and 44 (17.2%) patients with central nervous system infections. The most commonly affected sinuses were a combination of the transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus (21%), There was a statistically significant seasonal variation in CVST cases among all patients (P 0.03) and in the systemic risk factor group (P 0.05), with the highest number of cases occurring in the summer season.CVST may be influenced by seasonal changes in atmospheric temperatures and humidity, especially in patients with underlying prothrombotic risk factors.",2021,2021-12-01,1,Asian Journal of Neurosurgery,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Mustansir, F.

"Braun, E.; Sebestyén, T.; Kiss, T.",The strength of domestic production networks: an economic application of the finn cycling index,"There has been an increasing interest in analyzing the structure of domestic and global supply chains networks in the past decade. Concerns about potential (systemic) risks resulting from overdependence on global supply networks have been magnified during the lockdowns triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last year. Strengthening local and or domestic networks may be an adequate approach to overcome the severe economic implications of this overdependence, but it also rises the question of how one can measure the strength of domestic supply production networks and design an appropriate structure. The of this paper is to propose a method for measurement and to provide a first-cut analysis with this method on a sample of economies. Building on ecological network analysis, we borrow the Finn cycling index from its toolbox and show a ranking of countries with respect to the strength of their domestic production networks based on this index. The suggest that the countries are very heterogeneous both in terms of the level of cycling index and its sectoral decomposition. Using panel-econometric techniques, we point out the role of the openness and structural asymmetry in shaping this strength, also controlling for other macroeconomic characteristics of the economies. The estimates reveal that openness has a negative, while asymmetry has a positive effect on this index, but other country-specific characteristics also play a role in shaping the systemic operation of national economies as measured by the Finn cycling index.",2021,2021-09-19,1,Applied Network Science,,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4601 Applied Computing,"Braun, E.

Risk factors and causes associated with CDVTinclude systemic risk factors that cause hypercoagulability, or local factors such as head trauma. While consensus is that non-traumatic sinus vein thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation therapy, treatment of patients with TBI-induced CDVT is not yet established.MethodsRetrospective review of clinical data of pediatric patients presented to our medical center from July 2017 to August 2020. Inclusion criteria were age, birth to 18 years, admission due to head trauma, head CT scan with positive traumatic findings, and follow-up in our clinic. Exclusion criteria were a normal head CT on admission and failure to follow-up. Data regarding demographics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment, and status on follow-up were recorded. Study protocol was approved by our institutional ethics committee.One hundred sixty-two patients were enrolled. Falling accident occurred in 90.1%, a minority suffered from direct head trauma or gunshot wound. Of the patients, 95.1% suffered from mild TBI. Forty-two percent suffered from an associated intracranial injury. Fourteen cases with CDVT were included in the cohort. Linear fractures were significantly correlated with CDVT. Additionally, occipital suboccipital fractures, associated intracranial injury, and proximity of injury to the sinus were correlated with CDVT. From this group, 12 were treated conservatively one patient was treated surgically due to EDH. All patients with CDVT were neurologically intact at discharge. Only one patient was treated with therapeutic dose of LMWH. A total of 86.7% of patients with CDVT who were treated conservatively had full recanalization on follow-up imaging. Four patients had CDVS all were neurologically intact at admission and discharge, and all were treated conservatively and had full recanalization on follow-up.DiscussionTreatment with ACT is established in pediatric CDVT but not in the sub-group of TBI. While ACT prevents progression of thrombosis, it might cause worsening of extra-axial hemorrhage. In our study, no clinical deterioration was noted with expectant management thus, we present an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of trauma-induced CDVTin children with frequent clinical and radiologic imaging while avoiding anticoagulation.ConclusionIn most cases, anticoagulation therapy is not necessary in traumatic CDVT S. Initial expectant management in children is safe.

"Chen, W.; Chen, Y.",Two-Step measurement of water energy food symbiotic coordination and identification of key influencing factors in the yangtze river basin,"With the intensification of people's production and life behaviors, the systemic risks of water, energy and food in the Yangtze River Basin have become increasingly prominent, which has become a bottleneck for sustainable development of social, economic and ecological in the basin. Therefore, studying the symbiotic coordination between water, energy and food is of great significance to promoting regional sustainable development. First, from the perspective of water-energy-food symbiosis, with the water-energy-food ecosystem conceptual model as the nexus, the two-step measurement model of the symbiotic index and the symbiotic level index is used to study the water-energy-food symbiosis of the Yangtze River. Then, we use the BP-DEMATEL-GTCW model to identify the key influencing factors that affect the symbiotic security of the water-energy-food ecosystem. In this research, it is found that the average value of the symbiotic degree of the water-energy-food ecosystem of the 11 provinces or municipalities in the Yangtze River Basin only reached the risk grade. It can also be seen from the identification of key influencing factors that energy microsystem-related indicators have a greater impact on the symbiotic development of the entire WEF ecosystem. Therefore, special attention needs to be paid to increasing energy sources and reducing expenditure. Relevant departments need to effectively develop primary energy production and expand energy-saving investment through multiple channels to expand energy self-sufficiency and ultimately promote the coordinated and effective development of water, energy and food in the Yangtze River Basin.",2021,2021-06-23,7,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Chen, W.

"LI, H.; WANG, X.; ZHAO, X.; QI, Y.",Understanding systemic risk induced by climate change,"The systemic risk induced by climate change represents one of the most prominent threats facing humanity and has attracted increasing attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019. The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk to conduct empirical research to assess future risks and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk.",2021,2021-06-01,15,Advances in Climate Change Research,,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,"LI, H.

The best healing modality for postextraction sockets is still debated. The aim of the study was to estimate the incidence of MRONJ after extractions whose sockets were left to heal by secondary intention. METHODS: A retrospective case series study was performed at the Department of Odontostomatological and Maxillofacial Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome. Only patients who underwent nonsurgical extractions, healed by secondary intention, were included in the study. The following parameters were considered: age, sex, pathologies for which bisphosphonates or other drugs related to MRONJ were prescribed, any local or systemic risk factors, type of drug used, route of administration, number of extractions performed, and number of sessions required to complete the extraction program. The main outcome variable was the occurrence of MRONJ. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistical software.Two hundred twenty-one patients were treated from 2007 to 2020 with 639 tooth root extractions. All patients were treated under antibiotic prophylaxis and with anesthesia without vasoconstrictors. No cases of MRONJ occurred. The mean age of patients was 68.02 11.17. Most of the study sample was represented by women (201 90.95%) undergoing treatment for osteometabolic pathologies, most frequently postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate was the most frequently prescribed drug, taken mainly orally. Most patients had local and or systemic risk factors. Each patient had fromto 17 tooth root extractions (mean 2.87 2.59) duringtosessions (mean 1.41 0.64). Extractions mainly involved single-rooted teeth roots, equally distributed between the maxilla and mandible.Secondary intention healing after nonsurgical tooth extraction does not seem to predispose to MRONJ.

Recently, proposals for large-scale interventions-carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM)-have started to redefine climate governance strategies. We describe how evolving modeling practices are trending toward optimized and ""best-case"" projections-portraying deployment schemes that create both technically slanted and politically sanitized profiles of risk, as well as idealfor CDR and SRM as mitigation-enhancing, time-buying mechanisms for carbon transitions or vulnerable populations. As promises, stylized and hopeful projections may selectively reinforce industry and political activities built around the inertia of the carbon economy. Some evidence suggests this is the emerging case for certain kinds of CDR, where the prospect of future carbon capture substitutes for present mitigation. Either of these implications are systemic: explorations of climatic futures may entrench certain carbon infrastructures.

The dimension of these risks is hard to grasp with the conceptual tools that have been developed to tackle conventional risks like fire or car accidents. While modern societies know quite well how to deal with conventional risks, we have not yet been equally successful at dealing with global systemic risks. For managing this kind of risks, one needs to understand critical features of specific global systems where many human agents interact in ever changing complex networks. Here we apply two specific dimensions of complexity theory for dealing with global systemic risk in an integrated fashion: normal accidents and extended evolution. Both of them have successfully been applied to the analysis of systemic risks. As a paradigmatic example of global systemic risks, we focus on the global financial crisis that began in 2008, and suggest that the future evolution of the financial system could either see a further increase in complexity, or a reversal to a less complex system. We explore and contrast the implications of normal accident theory and extended evolution perspectives and suggest a four-point research strategy informed by complexity theory for better understanding global systemic risks in financial systems.",2020,2020-11-03,2,Risk Analysis,accidents; humans,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","Haas, A.

"Bai, X.; Sun, H.; Lu, S.; Taghizadeh-Hesary, F.",A review of micro-based systemic risk research from multiple perspectives,"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about a heavy impact on the world economy, which arouses growing concerns about potential systemic risk, taking place in countries and regions. At this critical moment, it makes sense to interpret the systemic risk from the perspective of the financial crisis framework. By combing the latest research on systemic risks, we may arrive at some precautions relating to the current events. This literature review verifies the origin of systemic risk research. By comparing the retrieved and screened systemic literature with the relevant research on the financial crisis, more focus on the micro-foundations of systemic risk has been discovered. Besides, the measurement methods of systemic risks and the of interdisciplinary methods have made the research in this field particularly active. This paper synthesizes the previous research to find the appropriate definition of systemic risk and combs the research literature of systemic risk from two lines: Firstly, conducting the division according to the sub-branch fields within the financial discipline and the relevant interdisciplinary research methods, which is helpful for scholars within and outside the discipline to have a more systematic understanding of the research in this field.

DESIGN: A retrospective hospital record-based study was conducted in patients of paralytic strabismus presenting from April 2016 to December 2017. METHODS: Data included demographic and clinical details, diagnosis, underlying etiology, imaging, laboratory reports, and the outcome.Mean age of presentation of 345 patients included in the study was 38.2 19.5 years (range 365 years). Pediatric patients (age: 16 years) constituted 9.5% of the entire cohort. Mean duration of complaints was 5.87 months. Of the 372 eyes of 345 cases, 42.7% were sixth nerve palsy, 34.7% were third nerve palsy, 17.7% were fourth nerve palsy, and 4.8% had multiple ocular motor nerve involvement. Third and sixth nerve palsies were mostly due to ischemic event (58.1% and 69.8% cases, respectively), whereas fourth nerve palsies were commonly caused by trauma (63.6%). Amongst traumatic cases, road traffic accident was the most common mode of trauma. Systemic risk factors were preexistent in 18.2% cases (n 63) in the remaining (40.8% 141), they were diagnosed after presentation. Complete or partial recovery was noted in 69.7% cases in third nerve palsy, 67.9% cases in sixth nerve palsy, and 45% cases in fourth nerve palsy.Acquired cranial nerve palsy has younger onset in Indian scenario.

"Wang, C.J.; Brownell, I.",BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of papulopustular eruptions from MAPK pathway inhibitors,"Inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are commonly used in clinical oncology. However, with the exception of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), MAPK pathway inhibitors such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRi) or MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are associated with dose-limiting papulopustular eruptions. Interestingly, patients treated with a combination of systemic BRAFi and MEKi experience less skin toxicities than patients on monotherapy BRAFi or MEKi. The reduction in cutaneous adverse events with combination therapy is thought to be due to a paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway by BRAFi in keratinocytes carrying wildtype BRAF. Although treatment options for EGFRi- or MEKi-induced papulopustular eruptions exist, many patients still experience dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation of EGFRi or MEKi. With the goal of activating MAPK signaling in the skin via BRAFi while minimizing systemic risks, we propose topical BRAFi therapy for the treatment and prevention of papulopustular eruptions due to MAPK pathway inhibitors. If effective, patients will be able to tolerate higher doses of MAPK pathway inhibitors, stay on treatment longer, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes overall.",2020,2020-07-27,4,American Journal of Clinical Dermatology,"administration, cutaneous; antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols; dose-response relationship, drug; drug eruptions; drug resistance, neoplasm; erbb receptors; humans; map kinase signaling system; mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases; molecular targeted therapy; neoplasms; protein kinase inhibitors; proto-oncogene proteins b-raf; skin; treatment outcome",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"Wang, C.J.

"Yang, H.; Liu, C.; Chou, R.Y.",Bank diversification and systemic risk,"One of the controversies of diversification is that it may not be necessarily beneficial to the banks as it leads to more severe systemic risk. Recent studies have modelled theoretical frameworks for the role of diversification in systemic risks faced by banks. As an alternative, we provide empirical evidence on this by examining the effects of bank diversification on systemic risk. Based on the sources of revenue of banks to measure diversification and using data of U.S. commercial banks from 2000 to 2013, we find that the bank diversification is associated with an increase in systemic risk. However, such effect of diversification on systemic risk is significant in larger- and medium sized banks. The effects are also significant during the 2007 2009 credit crunch and 2010 2013 European Debt crisis, supporting the idea that bank diversification plays a crucial role to influence systemic risk.",2020,2020-08-01,27,the Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Yang, H.

However, the ocular occlusive events might also influence a patient's systemic condition. This study tried to investigate serum biomarkers associated with oxidative stress, before and after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (aVEGF) therapy in patients with RVOs. METHODS: Newly-onset RVO patients were categorized into two groups: comorbid with macular edema requiring aVEGF therapy (treatment group) and no edema (observation group). Age and sex-matched patients (who received cataract surgery) were included as the control group. Intravitreal ranibizumab with a pro-re-nata regimen were administered. Serum samples were collected prior to treatment, atand 12 months after therapy observation and were collected once before controls who received cataract surgery. mRNA expression of sirtuin-1, its downstream genes, anti-oxidative biomarkers, and proinflammatory cytokines were measured.There were 32, 26, and 34 patients enrolled in the treatment, observation, and control groups, respectively. The expressions of sirtuin-1 and its downstream genes were significantly lower in patients with RVO compared with the control group. Sirtuin-1 gene expression increased afteryear of aVEGF therapy in the treatment group but remained unchanged in the observation group. Biomarkers of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines were reduced afteryear of aVEGF therapy. These biomarkers remained with no changes in the observation group.Our study showed that the systemic oxidative stress increased in RVO patients.

AIM: To measure choroidal thickness in diabetic eyes and to correlate it with established systemic risk factors, the severity and the therapy of diabetic retinopathy. METHOD: Prospective cross-sectional study using swept-source optical coherence tomography has been performed. Choroidal and macular thickness maps of 117 eyes of 60 diabetic patients were compared to data from 45 eyes of 24 healthy controls. In all diabetic patients, the systemic risk factors (duration and type of diabetes, blood hemoglobin A1C level, hypertension), the type (no, non-proliferative or proliferative) and the therapy of diabetic retinopathy were recorded, and their relation to choroidal thickness was evaluated using multiple regression models.A significantly thinner choroid was measured in diabetic patients compared to controls (p 0.05). Analysing the whole cohort, aging (p 0.001) and the presence of hypertension (p 0.05) showed significant correlation with choroidal thinning. In diabetic patients, the duration of diabetes significantly correlated with choroidal thinning (p 0.05). In multivariable analysis, the duration of diabetes remained a significant predictor of choroidal thickness (β -0.18 0.02). A significantly thinner choroid was measured in patients with proliferative retinopathy and in patients after panretinal photocoagulation treatment compared to nonproliferative retinopathy (p 0.05). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus itself and diabetic retinopathy progression affects choroidal thickness significantly. Choroidal thickness is affected significantly by systemic risk factors (age, the presence of hypertension, disease duration). Choroidal thinning proved to be correlated with panretinal photocoagulation treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

RECENT FINDINGS: CMN are primarily caused by sporadic postzygotic somatic mutations, most frequently in NRAS, and studies of the genetic underpinnings of CMN have demonstrated a diverse array of genetic drivers. The primary complications of large and giant CMN include neurocutaneous melanocytosis and malignant melanoma. Abnormalities in CNS MRI may predict a worse clinical course for patients and increased risk of melanoma. Targeted therapies of the MEK pathway have begun to be studied for the treatment of CMN and prevention of associated complications.

"Zhang, W.; Zhuang, X.; Wang, J.; Lu, Y.",Connectedness and systemic risk spillovers analysis of chinese sectors based on tail risk network,"This paper investigates the systemic risk spillovers and connectedness in the sectoral tail risk network of Chinese stock market, and explores the transmission mechanism of systemic risk spillovers by block models. Based on conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and single index model (SIM) quantile regression technique, we analyse the tail risk connectedness and find that during market crashes, stock market exposes to more systemic risk and more connectedness. Further, the orthogonal pulse function shows that Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of edges has a significant positive effect on systemic risk, but the impact shows a certain lagging feature. Besides, the directional connectedness of sectors shows that systemic risk receivers and transmitters vary across time, and we adopt PageRank index to identify systemically important sector released by utilities and financial sectors. Finally, by block model we find that the tail risk network of Chinese sectors can be divided into four different spillover function blocks. The role of blocks and the spatial spillover transmission path between risk blocks are time-varying.

As the time series of stock markets contain rich information of the corresponding complex systems, a novel method using the complex network theory is proposed to measure the systemic risk in stock markets. Through the correlation analysis the time series of stock market financial indicators can be converted to the series of the complex networks. The dynamic topological indices of the networks can be used to analyze the network transmission characteristics and calculate the systemic risk. Based on the network dynamics we construct and test the systemic risk measurement model from the perspectives of regional, financial and global stock indices respectively. The topological parameter model is introduced to measure the systemic risk and the comparison is made with the traditional measurement model. The show that the new model can provide more detailed and accurate information on the systemic risk of stock markets.

As such, the existing Royal College of Ophthalmologists DR Guidelines (2013) are outdated, and to the best of our knowledge are not under revision at present. Furthermore, there are no other UK guidelines covering all available treatments, and there seems to be significant variation around the UK in the management of diabetic macular oedema (DMO). This manuscript provides a summary of reviews the pathogenesis of DR and DMO, including role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and non-VEGF cytokines, clinical grading classification of DMO vis a vis current terminology (of centre-involving CI-DMOor non-centre involving nCI-DMOsystemic risks and their management). The excellent UK DR Screening (DRS) service has continued to evolve and remains world-leading. However, challenges remain, as there are significant variations in equipment used, and reproducible standards of DMO screening nationally. The interphase between DRS and the hospital eye service can only be strengthened with further improvements. The role of modern technology including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and wide-field imaging, and working practices including virtual clinics and their potential in increasing clinic capacity and improving patient experiences and outcomes are discussed. Similarly, potential roles of home monitoring in diabetic eyes in the future are explored. The role of pharmacological (intravitreal injections IVT of anti-VEGFs and steroids) and laser therapies are summarised. Generally, IVT anti-VEGF are offered as first line pharmacologic therapy. As requirements of diabetic patients in particular patient groups may vary, including pregnant women, children, and persons with learning difficulties, it is important that DR management is personalised in such particular patient groups. First choice therapy needs to be individualised in these cases and may be intravitreal steroids rather than the standard choice of anti-VEGF agents.

"Cole, W.",Early-stage management of complex lower extremity wounds using negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and a reticulated open cell foam with through holes,"Treatment modalities that overcome stalled wound healing in lower extremity wounds are crucial for reducing lower limb amputations, which have a 5-year mortality rate of an astounding 70%. Recent non-comparative studies have shown negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) using a dressing comprised of reticulated open cell foam with through holes (ROCF-CC) provides favorable clinical outcomes for various wound types, including complex lower extremity wounds.The of this study is to compare NPWTi-d using ROCF-CC dressings (treatment group) with advanced wound dressings (control group) in patients with chronic lower extremity wounds and known systemic risk factors for delayed healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective assessment was performed for 10 patients with complex lower extremity wounds that underwent an initial debridement and then were treated with either advanced wound dressings (control group 5) or NPWTi-d using ROCF-CC dressings (treatment group 5). Advanced wound dressings were applied to wounds and changedtotimes per week. Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time was applied by instilling normal saline onto wounds, with a dwell time of 20 minutes, followed by continuous negative pressure (-125 mm Hg) forhours. The ROCF-CC dressings were changed everytodays.Patients in the treatment group had significantly fewer wound complications (P .024) and underwent significantly fewer surgical debridements (P .004) when compared with patients in the control group. All wounds in the treatment group healed without complication, whereas onlyof thewounds in the control group healed. Demographics and comorbidities were similar between groups.These data further support the use of NPWTi-d with ROCF-CC to help manage complex wounds of the lower limb.",2020,2020-03-31,2,Wounds a Compendium of Clinical Research and Practice,aged; bandages; debridement; female; humans; leg injuries; male; negative-pressure wound therapy; retrospective studies; wound healing,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Cole, W.

Projections commonly extrapolate from recent histories and adopt a 'business as usual' approach that risks failing to take account of shocks or unpredictable events that can have dramatic consequences for the status quo, as seen with the global Covid-19 pandemic. This study used an explorative stakeholder process and shock centred narratives to discuss the potential impact of a diversity of shocks, examining system characteristics and trends that may amplify their impact. Through the development of scenarios, stakeholders revealed concerns about the stability of the food system and the social, economic and environmental consequence of food related shocks. Increasing connectivity served as a mechanism to heighten volatility and vulnerability within all scenarios, with reliance on singular crops and technologies (i.e. low diversity) throughout systems highlighted as another potential source of vulnerability.

"Colon, C.; Brännström, Å.; Rovenskaya, E.; Dieckmann, U.",Fragmentation of production amplifies systemic risks from extreme events in supply-chain networks,"Climatic and other extreme events threaten the globalized economy, which relies on increasingly complex and specialized supply-chain networks. Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firms-a measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms.",2020,2020-12-28,5,Plos One,"disasters; economic development; game theory; logistic models; models, economic; resource allocation","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems","Colon, C.

These systems are exposed to scenarios of cascading outbreaks, whose impacts can ripple to very large scales through their strong interdependencies, as recently shown by the pandemic spreading of the Coronavirus. Considerable work has been conducted in recent years to develop frameworks to support the assessment, communication, management and governance of this type of risk, building on concepts like systemic risks, complexity theory, deep uncertainties, resilience engineering, adaptive management and black swans. Yet contemporary risk analysis struggles to provide authoritative societal guidance for adequately handling these types of risks, as clearly illustrated by the Coronavirus case. In this paper, we reflect on this situation. We aim to identify critical challenges in current frameworks of risk assessment and management and point to ways to strengthen these, to be better able to confront threats like the Coronavirus in the future.

"Kabundi, A.N.; De, S.F.N.",Growth and inflation implications of systemic risk in the euro area banking industry: lessons from the financial crisis,"This study has two s. It first assesses the output and inflation effects of systemic risk-taking in the euro area banking sector using a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model that exploits a 519 time-series rich dataset, including coherent measures of systemic risk in all its forms and its time dimension. Then, it evaluates whether the systemic risk measures can be used as early warning signals of severe negative nominal growth outcomes using the Receiver Operating Characteristic approach. The main findings are that, overall, real GDP growth and inflation react negatively to a one-standard deviation shock to systemic risk measures of the euro area banking industry. Inflation depicts a more pronounced response than GDP. There is heterogeneity in the strength of the responses across diverse forms of systemic risk and their time dimension. Specifically, short-term systemic risk measures tend to portray stronger effects on output and inflation than their conditional forward counterparts. In particular, systemic risk in the form of banking sector vulnerability associated with interconnectedness and contagion plays a considerable role in depressing economic activity in the euro area. Finally, all but one systemic risk measure predict with high accuracy the extreme macro-financial instability in the euro area that followed Lehman Brothers’ collapse. The systemic risk measures are potentially good candidates to be included in a macroprudential-policy toolkit for calibrating instruments at thresholds that reflect policymakers’ risk preferences.",2020,2020-01-01,2,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Kabundi, A.N.

"Shah, A.; Uy, M.; Yan, J.R.; Khan, M.; Alolabi, B.",Heterotopic ossification following total elbow arthroplasty in a patient with parkinson’s disease: case report and literature review,"ossification (HO) usually develops following surgery or trauma. Risk factors for HO following elbow fractures include delay to surgery7 days), floating fractures, and elbow subluxation. Systemic risk factors for HO include male sex concurrent cranial, neurological, or abdominal injury high-energy trauma previous development of HO and contralateral fracture. To date, no studies have reported on Parkinson's disease (PD) as a risk factor for the development of HO. Case Presentation. A 68-year-old female with PD (treated with levodopa-carbidopa) sustained a right closed (OTA type A3) distal humerus fracture and was treated with a total elbow arthroplasty. Postoperatively, development of significant near-ankylosing HO was observed and contributed to significant restriction of elbow motion with activities of daily living. After HO maturation, the osseous growth was excised, and the area irradiated. The patient regained excellent elbow motion with no recurrence of HO. Discussion. A literature review revealed six cases of HO development in PD patients following arthroplasty. Patients with PD have higher serum concentrations of interleukins (IL) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α. These factors stimulate BMP-2 production which may promote osteogenesis. Levodopa-carbidopa may also influence HO through stimulation of growth hormone and IGF-1. Conclusion. Parkinsonism may promote heterotopic bone growth through the release of osteoinductive factors. HO development may also be mediated by levodopa-carbidopa therapy. Future research should highlight the link between HO and PD and identify if prophylaxis is warranted in PD patients undergoing arthroplasty.",2020,2020-03-10,1,Case Reports in Surgery,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,"Shah, A.

The soft-tissue connection provides a barrier seal directly to the implant or implant abutment and plays a critical role in limiting peri-implant disease. Therefore, clinicicans must take great care in managing the soft tissue. This article discusses three key stages of soft-tissue connection that should be considered when providing dental implant therapy: the healing stage, where cellular adhesion and proliferation are attained the restorative phase, during which protection is provided to the mature soft-tissue site and maintenance, a phase where the soft tissue offers revealing information about the health of the implant.",2020,2020-01-01,1,Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry,dental implants; humans; peri-implantitis; tooth,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Wadhwani, C.P.K.

"Civan, Z.; Simsek, G.G.; Akay, E.C.",Identifying the systemically important banks of turkey with the covar method,"The purpose of this paper is to measure the systemic risk contributions of Turkish banks and to identify the systemically important banks of Turkey during the period from 2005 to 2016. We apply the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) method proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009) using quantile regression. The study includes thirteen major banks of Turkey, including both public and private banks, out of a total of 52 banks. The banks are ranked in terms of their systemic risk contribution to the Turkish financial system based on their asset returns, macroeconomic variables and individual bank variables. The study reveals that Akbank, Garanti, Yapi Kredi and Isbank have the highest systemic risk contribution to the financial system when adding macroeconomic variables to the model. This ranking is changed to Yapi Kredi, Garanti, TEB, Sekerbank and Akbank when taking into account bank-specific variables. One surprising result is that risk in isolation and the spillover risks of public banks are smaller than in large private banks. Furthermore, the marginal systemic risk contributions of public banks are smaller than those of private banks. In conclusion, authorities improve the regulatory framework according to the context of CoVaR in addition to monitor the idiosyncratic risks of banks.",2020,2020-09-01,2,Heliyon,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Civan, Z.

A general overview of Indigenous worldviews frames a discussion on the coherence of international human rights law and instruments, including the Convention, account for Indigenous Peoples' ontologies. The authors argue that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN General Assembly, 2007) and a new theoretical framework published by the Pan American Health Organization (2019) on health equity and inequity are useful tools to augment the Convention's coherence with Indigenous ontologies. The paper discusses how the Convention can be applied to structural and systemic risks driving the over-representation of First Nations and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out of home care in Canada and Australia. These two countries are included as First Nations and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in these countries have both had significant impact in advocating for their children despite experiencing similar barriers including contemporary colonialism. The advocacy work of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society in Canada and the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency in Victoria, Australia are discussed. The paper ends by outlining some of the challenges ahead that include the need to meaningfully recognize Indigenous self-determination and equitable funding and resources to enable the actualization of self-determination.

This retrospective clinical and radiological cohort study assessed the long-term outcome of VTTIs. Material and Methods: All patients treated in an OMFS practice with NobelActive Internal VTTI between October 2007 and September 2011 were invited for clinical examination. The outcome variables were (i) survival rate, (ii) implant success according to the ""Health Scale for Dental Implants"" and (iii) prevalence of peri-implantitis. Furthermore, the effect of local and systemic risk factors was investigated.In 81 subjects (46 females and 35 males, mean age 65.6 years) 270 implants (157 VTTIs and 113 others as a control group) were analyzed. Inout of 81 patients (8.6%),out of 157 VTTIs (5.1%) andout of 113 other implants (4.4%) were lost. Peri-implantitis, defined as (i) presence of bleeding on gentle probing (0.25 N) or exudation and (ii) radiographic bone loss exceeding 0.5 mm since implant insertion to last follow-up, was the most common reason for implant loss (11 out of 13, 84.6%). Sixty-six out of 87 VTTIs (75.9%) were successful. Seventeen out of 42 patients (40.5%) developed peri-implantitis on 29 out of 79 VTTI sites (36.7%).

"Kaszowska-Mojsa, J.; Pipień, M.",Macroprudential policy in a heterogeneous environment an application of agent-based approach in systemic risk modelling,"Assessment of welfare effects of macroprudential policy seems the most important application of the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework of macro-modelling. In particular, the DSGE-3D model, with three layers of default (3D), was developed and used by the European Systemic Risk Board and European Central Bank as a reference tool to formally model the financial cycle as well as to analyze effects of macroprudential policies. Despite the extreme importance of incorporating financial constraints in Real Business Cycle (RBC) models, the resulting DSGE-3D construct still embraces the representative agent idea, making serious analyses of diversity of economic entities impossible. In this paper, we present an alternative to DSGE modelling that seriously departs from the assumption of the representativeness of agents. Within an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) framework, we build an environment suitable for performing counterfactual simulations of the impact of macroprudential policy on the economy, financial system and society.

Though there are several well-documented channels through which monetary policy operates, we focus on the overlooked trading book channel, which arises because of adjustments in the accounting value of trading book exposures on banks' balance sheets that have to be marked to market when interest rates change. Variations in banks' net worth due these adjustments are used as input to a network model that incorporates the financial and corporate sectors. The framework permits us to determine the effects of interest rate changes on every bank and firm in the economy and any second-round (contagion) effects in the short run. We apply the model to a comprehensive database of Brazilian banks and firms from 2015 to 2020. We find that interest rate shocks affect more strongly financial stability in periods of monetary policy tightening. We also find notable asymmetric effects of positive and negative interest rate shocks in the Brazilian economy, with positive interest rate shocks affecting more financial stability.

Using medical history data and medical records, the presence of systemic disease, namely hypertension, typediabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia, was studied in these patients and evaluated for a possible association with NAION.In the group of patients who were treated with intravenous vasodilators, the resulting CVA improved by 0.083 on average. In the group of patients who, in addition to vasodilator therapy, also received treatment with corticosteroids, the resulting CVA improved by only 0.03 on average. Although there was a more prominent improvement in CVA in the group treated with intravenous vasodilators alone, this difference was not statistically significant. At least one risk factor was found in the vast majority of the patients (96%). Eighty percent of the patients had hypertension, 43.6% of them were treated for diabetes mellitus, and 72.7% of the patients took drugs for hypercholesterolaemia. A combination of all these conditions was found in 36.4% of the patients. The proportion of smokers and past smokers did not exceed that of non-smokers. CONCLUSION: The mean improvement in the resulting CVA in patients after systemic therapy with vasodilators alone was greater than in those treated with a combination of vasodilators and corticosteroids however, this difference was not statistically significant. In most patients in the group, at least one systemic risk factor was noted, most frequently hypertension. The prevalence rate of systemic risk factors was comparable to that reported in the literature.",2020,2020-10-01,3,Czech and Slovak Ophthalmology,"aged; aged, 80 and over; diabetes mellitus, type 2; female; humans; male; middle aged; optic neuropathy, ischemic; retrospective studies; risk factors; visual acuity",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Kalábová, S.

"Chen, M.","Normal tension glaucoma in asia: epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management","Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) has similar optic neuropathy as primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), but intraocular pressure (IOP) is within the normal range. Compared with high-pressure POAG, the development of NTG is possibly a consequence of a complex interaction of several ocular and systemic factors. Recent data have shown higher translaminar pressure gradient due to impaired cerebrospinal fluid dynamics may account for the pathogenic mechanism. Insufficient blood supply and vascular dysregulation may also be the cause of the disease. In clinical evaluation, NTG is a diagnosis by excluding other nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies. NTG is characterized by larger and deeper optic-disc cupping, more central visual field defects and a higher incidence of disc hemorrhage compared with POAG. In clinical practice, controlling IOP as low as possible (with medication, laser trabeculoplasty, or surgery) is the key to manage NTG patients. In addition to IOP reduction, the control of systemic risk factors or improving ocular perfusion may be beneficial therapies. NTG is more prevalent in Asia than in the Western countries. Due to increasing old population and underdiagnoses in the clinical settings, NTG became a great challenge for ophthalmologist in Asia. Therefore, the aim of this article is to focus on the epidemiology, to update pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management for NTG.",2020,2020-07-13,11,Taiwan Journal of Ophthalmology,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Chen, M.

"Bluher, A.; Kawai, K.; Wang, A.; Stiles, D.; Licameli, G.",Obesity as a possible risk factor for pediatric sensorineural hearing loss,"HYPOTHESIS: Childhood hearing loss impacts linguistic, academic, social, and psychologic development, and may have lasting implications for future workforce performance. Current evidence for obesity as a pediatric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) risk factor is intriguing but equivocal. We hypothesized that obesity is associated with a higher risk of SNHL. We additionally examined whether underweight is associated with a higher risk of SNHL. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review. METHODS: A single-institution audiologic database from 2015 to 2020 was queried for audiograms with type-A tympanograms from children agedto 18 years old. Comorbidities known to be associated with hearing loss were excluded. We then examined both for sub-clinical15 dB) high- or low-frequency hearing loss, and for clinical21 dB) hearing loss, with the aim of examining the association between obesity and SNHL. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism.A total of 3,142 children were included. Obesity was not associated with risk of SNHL (adjusted OR 0.82 95% CI: 0.60, 1.12). Underweight children had a higher risk of SNHL than normal weight children (adjusted OR 1.78 95% CI: 1.08, 2.95). Autism was significantly associated with increased risk of sub-clinical SNHL only (adjusted OR 2.00 95% CI 1.34, 2.98).No association was found between obesity and pediatric SNHL. Underweight children may represent a higher-risk population for SNHL. There appears to be an increasing risk of SNHL as children approach adolescence. Further study of systemic risk factors for SNHL is indicated.

"Scharf, J.; Freund, K.B.; Sadda, S.; Sarraf, D.",Paracentral acute middle maculopathy and the organization of the retinal capillary plexuses,"The retinal capillary vasculature serves the formidable role of supplying the metabolically active inner and middle retina. In the parafoveal region, the retinal capillary plexuses (RCP) are organized in a system of three capillary layers of varying retinal depths: the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP). While the dynamic flow through these plexuses is complex and not completely understood, current research points to a hybrid model that includes both parallel and in series components in which blood flows in a predominantly serial direction between the superficial vascular complex (SVC) and deep vascular complex (DVC). Each capillary plexus autoregulates independently, so that under most conditions the retinal vasculature supplies adequate blood flow and oxygen saturation at varying depths despite diverse environmental stressors. When the flow in the deep vascular complex (i.e. ICP and DCP) fails, an ischemic lesion referred to as Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy (PAMM) can be identified. PAMM is an optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding defined by the presence of a hyperreflective band at the level of the inner nuclear layer (INL) that indicates INL infarction caused by globally impaired perfusion through the retinal capillary system leading to hypoperfusion of the DVC or specifically the DCP. Patients present with an acute onset paracentral scotoma and typically experience a permanent visual defect. Lesions can be caused by a diverse set of local retinal vascular diseases and systemic disorders. PAMM is a manifestation of the retinal ischemic cascade in which the mildest forms of ischemia develop at the venular end of the DCP, i.e. perivenular PAMM, while more severe forms progress horizontally to diffusely involve the INL, and the most severe forms progress vertically to infarct the inner retina.

A case control study was conducted in the Department of Ophthalmology Visual Science, Eye ENT Hospital, Fudan University from April 2017 to December 2017. A total of 400 participants were consecutively recruited into this study (100 PACG, 100 POAG and 200 controls). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the association between serum NT level and PACG or POAG. Clinical were validated in cell and animal models. Among 200 glaucoma patients, 101 (50.5%) were women the age was 57.07 14.51 years. 106 (53%) control participants were women and age was 58.34 14.04 years.

METHODS: A total of 83 patients underwent bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of conjunctival swabs obtained from both eyes because of local risk factors at the pre-operative visit (i.e. chronic blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or lacrimal system disease), and or systemic risk factors (i.e. autoimmune or skin disorders) for developing post-operative infection. If the swab was found positive, an antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed, and a specific antibiotic therapy was administered. Surgery was performed when a repeat conjunctival swab (after antibiotic treatment) showed negative cultures.Cultures were found positive in 25.3% of patients.

This study was undertaken to determine the culture-positivity rate of P. aeruginosa and drug resistance among patients with suspected external ocular infections and to predict systemic risk factors for drug resistance in P. aeruginosa. Methods This retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional study involved 781 consecutive patients who provided samples for aerobic culture to test for a suspected external ocular infection. DRP was defined as a strain resistant to one or two of three antibiotics, levofloxacin, gentamicin, and imipenem MDRP was defined as that which was resistant to all three. Among 108 patients in whom gram-negative bacilli were observed, P. aeruginosa was isolated from nine patients, including three DRP-positive cases no MDRP was isolated. P. aeruginosa was not isolated from those 69 years of age. Among patients in whom gram-negative bacilli were detected, the isolation rate of P. aeruginosa wasfor patients aged 64 and 0.1 for those aged 65, indicating a significant difference. For patients with gram-negative bacilli, the DRP-positivity rate was significantly higher for hospitalized patients than outpatients. Thus, in addition to being geriatric, being hospitalized was a risk factor for DRP infection among patients with gram-negative bacilli. All the P. aeruginosa strains isolated were susceptible to colistin. Our findings may suggest that once gram-negative bacilli are isolated in an elderly hospitalized patient, possible DRP infection and the topical use of colistin should be taken into consideration even before the of culture and susceptibility testing are obtained.",2020,2020-05-13,0,Cureus,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3207 Medical Microbiology,"Sato, K.

"Dastkhan, H.",Principles of systemic risk in financial markets: A special focus on the application of financial networks,"Although the complex financial markets more often lead to more social welfare in modern economic systems, they can also cause more severe failures in the case of market downturns. Accordingly, Similar to other complex systems, financial markets are also exposed to systemic risks. Considering the importance of systemic risks in financial markets, we reviewed different concepts, definitions, and the related principles of the systemic risk. For this purpose, we represent a detailed review of the main characteristics of the complex systems which lead to systemic risk in different aspects. We also reviewed the main definitions of financial systemic risk in different aspects. To analyze the systemic risks in the financial markets, we introduce the main approaches of systemic risk analysis and elaborate financial network analysis as one of the main approaches. The show that the systemic risk events can be related to the buildup of small shock on different agents in the financial systems as well as great shocks in one or a few numbers of financial agents.",2020,2020-01-01,0,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","Dastkhan, H.

This financial information is derived from processes and their related monetary flows within a business. But as the flows are becoming larger and more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to distill the primary processes for large amounts of transaction data. However, by extracting the primary processes we will be able to detect possible inconsistencies in the information efficiently. We use recent advances in network embedding techniques that have demonstrated promising regarding node classification problems in domains like biology and sociology. We learned a useful continuous vector representation of the nodes in the network which can be used for the clustering task, such that the clusters represent the meaningful primary processes. The show that we can extract the relevant primary processes which are similar to the created clusters by a financial expert. Moreover, we construct better predictive models using the flows from the extracted primary processes which can be used to detect inconsistencies.

There was no satisfactory response to lubricants and patching, and the patient had no associated systemic risk factors. As the thinning increased, cyanoacrylate glue with bandage contact lens was applied, but the dellen reappeared seven days after glue removal. Dellen finally resolved with thermal punctal cautery applied to both puncta. Dellen most commonly respond to artificial tears, antibiotic ointment, and patch application.

We use novel event study methodology and find that securitization has a positive impact on European banks' systematic risk during the 2000 to 2007 period and that subsequent securitizations have not any impact on systematic risk. The increase in systematic risk is due to an increase in systemic risk and in banks' idiosyncratic risk. By dividing the sample into those countries on the periphery and those at the core of Europe, it is found that securitization only has an impact on the systematic risk during the pre-crisis period, and only when looking at the peripheral countries does this lead to an increase in systemic risk. For individual countries, there is an observable effect for Spain and the UK prior to the crisis. On controlling for the type of collateral, it is found that this effect occurs when dealing with mortgage-based securitizations.",2020,2020-02-03,4,Plos One,economic recession; europe; financial management; risk management,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Iglesias-Casal, A.

"Rossin, E.J.; Gilbert, A.L.; Koen, N.; Leslie-Mazwi, T.M.; Cunnane, M.E.; Rizzo, J.F.",Site of origin of the ophthalmic artery influences the risk for retinal versus cerebral embolic events,"Embolic events leading to retinal ischemia or cerebral ischemia share common risk factors however, it has been well documented that the rate of concurrent cerebral infarction is higher in patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) than in those with monocular vision loss (MVL) due to retinal ischemia. Despite the fact that emboli to the ophthalmic artery (OA) and middle cerebral artery share the internal carotid artery (ICA) as a common origin or transit for emboli, the asymmetry in their final destination has not been fully explained. We hypothesize that the anatomic location of the OA takeoff from the ICA may contribute to the differential flow of small emboli to the retinal circulation vs the cerebral circulation. METHODS: We report a retrospective, comparative, case-control study on 28 patients with retinal ischemia and 26 patients with TIA or cerebral infarction caused by embolic events. All subjects underwent either computed tomography angiography or MRA. The location of the ipsilateral OA origin off the ICA was then graded in a blinded fashion and compared between cohorts. Vascular risk factors were collected for all patients, including age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and smoking.We find that in patients with retinal ischemia of embolic etiology, the ipsilateral OA takeoff from the ICA is more proximal than in patients with cerebral infarcts or TIA (P 0.0002). We found no statistically significant differences in demographic, vascular, or systemic risk factors.We find that the mean anatomical location of the OA takeoff from the ICA is significantly more proximal in patients with MVL due to retinal ischemia compared with patients with TIA or cerebral ischemia. This finding contributes significantly to our understanding of a long observed but poorly understood phenomenon that patients with MVL are less likely to have concurrent cerebral ischemia than are patients with TIA.",2020,2020-01-24,0,Journal of Neuro-ophthalmology,"aged; brain ischemia; carotid artery, internal; case-control studies; computed tomography angiography; embolism; female; humans; intracranial embolism; ischemia; magnetic resonance angiography; male; middle aged; ophthalmic artery; retinal artery; retinal diseases; retrospective studies; risk factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Rossin, E.J.

"Anagnostopoulos, G.; Moosavi, V.",StationRank: aggregate dynamics of the swiss railway,"Increasing availability and quality of actual, as opposed to scheduled, open transport data offers new possibilities for capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of railway and other networks of social infrastructure. One way to describe such complex phenomena is in terms of stochastic processes. At its core, a stochastic model is domain-agnostic and algorithms discussed here have been successfully used in other applications, including Google's PageRank citation ranking. Our key assumption is that train routes constitute meaningful sequences analogous to sentences of literary text. A corpus of routes is thus susceptible to the same analytic tool-set as a corpus of sentences. With our experiment in Switzerland, we introduce a method for building Markov Chains from aggregated daily streams of railway traffic data. The stationary distributions under normal and perturbed conditions are used to define systemic risk measures with non-evident, valuable information about railway infrastructure.",2020,2020-12-21,0,Plos One,"markov chains; models, spatial interaction; railroads; stochastic processes; switzerland","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","Anagnostopoulos, G.

"Rakow, A.; Schoon, J.",Systemic effects of metals released from arthroplasty implants a brief summary,"In recent years, increasing concern has been raised regarding potential systemic toxicity of metals released from arthroplasty implants. A lack of valid metal thresholds for human (organ) toxicity and the prospect of multi-decade survival of modern hip and knee replacements pose special challenges. Indeed, evidence of systemic effects of metals released from such implants is largely missing. Systemic cobalt exposure has repeatedly been associated with cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects, and also with thyroid dysfunction. The toxic potential of chromium is considered less pronounced. Yet, in arthroplasty there is usually a co-exposure to chromium and cobalt which complicates evaluation of element-specific effects. Toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles has been subject to debate among international regulatory authorities. Their wide use in a variety of products in everyday life, such as toothpaste, cosmetics and food colorants, hampers the assessment of an arthroplasty-induced systemic titanium exposure. To date there is no clear evidence for systemic complications due to titanium dioxide released from arthroplasty implants. Release of further metals such as tantalum, niobium, nickel, vanadium and zirconium from hip and knee replacement implants has been described occasionally, but systemic effects of respective long-term exposure scenarios are unknown. Generally, the characterization of all released metals regarding their chemical and physical specifications is critical for the evaluation of potential systemic risks. Systematic studies investigating the accumulation of metals relevant in arthroplasty in different organs organ systems and the biological consequences of such accumulations are urgently needed.",2020,2020-09-17,4,Zeitschrift Für Orthopädie Und Unfallchirurgie,"arthroplasty, replacement, hip; arthroplasty, replacement, knee; chromium; cobalt; hip prosthesis; humans; zirconium",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology,"Rakow, A.

"Bek, T.",Systemic risk factors contribute differently to the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular oedema,"Aims hypothesisThe purpose of screening for diabetic retinopathy is to detect either of the two sight-threatening complications: proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or clinically significant diabetic macular oedema (DME). The aim of the study was to evaluate whether systemic risk factors affect the risk of developing these two complications differently.MethodsSurvival analysis with death as a competing risk was used to describe the effect of sex, age and time of onset of diabetes, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BPs, and the weighted exposure and CV of HbA1c for the development of PDR and DME from all 2773 patients treated for diabetic retinopathy in a defined population from the Aarhus area, Denmark, betweenJuly 1994 andJuly 2019.Increasing HbA1c above normal increased the risk of developing both PDR and DME (p 0.08). The risk of developing PDR increased with decreasing age of onset of diabetes (p 0.0001), whereas the risk of developing DME was maximal for a known onset of diabetes at about 30 years of age and decreased significantly for both lower and higher ages of onset (p 0.0001). The risk of developing both PDR and DME was lower in women than in men (p 0.004) and was reduced with lower variability of repeated HbA1c measurements (p 0.0001). interpretationSystemic risk factors such as metabolic regulation, arterial BP and the age of onset of diabetes contribute differently to the development of PDR and DME.

A common C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene in decreased enzyme activity, which contributes to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). Previous studies have shown that HHcy was correlated with various systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, renal failure and so on. However, we hypothesized that HHcy in different genotype and sex groups may have different risk factors, which would lead to various pathologic states. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore systemic information that are correlated with HHcy for specific MTHFR C677T genotypes and sex, which might be useful for predicting and preventing systemic diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, clinical evaluations of periodontal and peri-implant conditions were performed by a single examiner in a sample of 71 volunteers with 360 implants. Peri-implant mucositis was defined as the occurrence of bleeding on probing in association with redness and swelling or suppuration, without bone loss. Peri-implantitis was defined based on a radiograph of bone loss mm and or a probing depth mm with bleeding and or suppuration on probing. The systemic factors evaluated were obesity, hormone replacement therapy, osteopaenia and osteoporosis, high blood pressure and hypercholesterolaemia. Logistic models were applied to assess the associations between peri-implant diseases and systemic factors.Mucositis and peri-implantitis were found in 83.1% and 16.9% of the individuals, respectively. The regression analysis showed that obesity (prevalence ratio 5.23 95% confidence interval, 1.91 to 96.83 0.01) and high systolic blood pressure (prevalence ratio 4.23 95% confidence interval, 1.66 to 12.87 0.03) were associated with peri-implantitis at the individual and implant levels, respectively. No systemic factor was associated with peri-implant mucositis (P 0.06). CONCLUSION: Obesity and high systolic blood pressure were associated with peri-implantitis, whereas no systemic factor was associated with peri-implant mucositis.

Due to these characteristics, systemic risks are overextending established risk management and create new, unsolved challenges for policymaking in risk assessment and risk governance. Their negative effects are often pervasive, impacting fields beyond the obvious primary areas of harm. This article addresses these challenges of systemic risks from different disciplinary and sectorial perspectives. It highlights the special contributions of these perspectives and approaches and provides a synthesis for an interdisciplinary understanding of systemic risks and effective governance. The main argument is that understanding systemic risks and providing good governance advice relies on an approach that integrates novel modeling tools from complexity sciences with empirical data from observations, experiments, or simulations and evidence-based insights about social and cultural response patterns revealed by quantitative (e.g., surveys) or qualitative (e.g., participatory appraisals) investigations. Systemic risks cannot be easily characterized by single numerical estimations but can be assessed by using multiple indicators and including several dynamic gradients that can be aggregated into diverse but coherent scenarios. Lastly, governance of systemic risks requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation, a close monitoring system, and the engagement of scientists, regulators, and stakeholders to be effective as well as socially acceptable.",2020,2020-12-16,39,Risk Analysis,risk management,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,"Renn, O.

Therefore, based on the daily return of all a-shares in China, this paper constructs a dynamic complex network of individual stocks, and represents the systemic risk of the market using the average weighting degree, as well as the adjusted structural entropy, of the network. In order to eliminate the influence of disturbance factors, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) are used to decompose and reconstruct the sequences to obtain the evolution trend and periodic fluctuation of systemic risk.

While much resilience research focuses on ethnic and cultural minorities, little research focuses specifically on American Indian Alaskan Native (AI AN) families. The parent-child relationship has been demonstrated to be a key characteristic in families, and this relationship may also serve as a protective factor for AI AN families. Positive parent-child relationships are consistently linked to positive child outcomes, and parental psychological symptoms are linked with child psychological symptoms in non-Native families. These associations warrant further examination among AI AN families. We hypothesized that the parent-child relationship would moderate the link between parent distress (i.e., depressive and anxious symptoms) and child internalizing problems in a sample of 57 AI AN parents of children 3-5 years of age. As expected, the parent-child relationship moderated the associations between parent anxiety symptoms and child internalizing symptoms, and between parent depressive symptoms and child internalizing symptoms. Furthermore, the strength of the parent-child relationship buffered the effects of parent distress on child internalizing symptoms. highlight the potentially protective role of strong parent-child relationships in AI AN families.",2020,2020-11-01,3,Journal of Community Psychology,alaskan natives; american indian or alaska native; humans; parent-child relations; parents; protective factors,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"Tolliver‐Lynn, M.N.

By analyzing these model systems, the elementary processes and the generic mechanisms by which they generate macroscopic dynamic structures become evident.

"Hoffmann, U.; Clemens, V.; König, E.; Brähler, E.; Fegert, J.M.",Violence against children and adolescents by nursing staff: prevalence rates and implications for practice,"International studies show that child maltreatment is a widespread but often underestimated problem that causes high individual, social and economic costs. Child maltreatment is an important topic for the medical sector as well. On the one hand, affected persons often seek support and help from healthcare professionals, but on the other hand, assaults can also occur in medical institutions by healthcare professionals. Surprisingly, there is hardly any data on the frequency of child maltreatment by healthcare professionals in general and particularly by nursing staff.MethodsTherefore, in a large representative survey of the German population of 2,516 subjects aged between 14 and 91, the experience of child maltreatment in medical institutions by nursing staff was assessed retrospectively.Of the 46 subjects who had an inpatient stay in a child and adolescent psychiatry before the age of 18, 33.3% reported to have experienced maltreatment by nursing staff, while 17.3% of the 474 persons who had an inpatient stay in general or pediatric hospitals experienced maltreatment by nursing staff. All forms of maltreatment were significantly more frequent in psychiatric compared to general and pediatric hospitals.The of our representative retrospective survey demonstrate that maltreatment by nursing staff are not rare individual cases, but that medical facilities bear systemic risks for assault. Therefore, it is necessary that all medical institutions, in particular psychiatric hospitals, address this issue. In order to reduce the risk for assaults, it is important not only to implement structural measures but also to develop an attitude that emphasizes zero tolerance for violence against children and adolescents.",2020,2020-11-06,9,Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health,,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,"Hoffmann, U.

"Ramanathan, D.; Berkowitz, M.J.; Davis, A.; Pinney, S.J.; Miniaci-Coxhead, S.L.",Vitamindeficiency and outcomes after ankle fusion,"Category: Ankle Arthritis Ankle Basic Sciences Biologics Hindfoot Purpose: Ankle fusions are associated with a complication profile including nonunion with associated poor functional outcomes, chronic pain, and need for reoperation. Local risk factors (bone and soft-tissue loss, infection, ankle and hindfoot deformity, and neuropathy) and systemic risk factors (advanced age, smoking, alcohol abuse, worker’s compensation, noncompliance, obesity, and systemic comorbidities such as diabetes and immunodeficiency) have been shown to be associated with the development of a nonunion following fusion procedures. Vitaminhas an important role in bone healing, and vitamindeficiency has been proposed as a potential risk factor for the development of non-unions. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of low vitaminlevels on reoperation rates and the development of nonunions following ankle fusion surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all ankle fusions performed at a major health system from January 2010 to July 2019 was performed. In total, 240 ankle fusions were performed by seven surgeons. All patients who underwent primary fusion procedures were eligible for inclusion in this study. Exclusion criteria included: age less than 18 years revision surgery ankle fusion with the use of bulk allograft ankle fusion performed as part of an oncologic reconstruction and an absence of recorded vitaminlevels with 12 months of surgery. In total, 47 patients met inclusion criteria and formed the study group. In this group, 29 47 (61.7%) were female and 18 47 (38.3%) were male. Average age was 57.0 12.3 years (range: 18.6 to 75.7). Patients were grouped according to their vitaminlevels as being deficient31 ng ml) or normal (31-80 ng ml). Prevalence of vitamindeficiency was 36.2% (17 47) at average of 35.7 ng ml. In vitamindeficient subgroup (n 17), average vitaminlevel was 16.9 ng ml. In normal vitaminsubgroup (n 30), average vitaminwas 46.4 ng ml. Overall, reoperation rate was 21.3% (10 47). Reoperation rate was 35.3% (6 17) in vitamindeficiency subgroup compared with 13.3% (4 30) reoperation rate in normal vitaminsubgroup (p 0.05). In vitamindeficient subgroup,procedures for nonunion included: dynamization (n 1), revision fusion (n 1), staged revision (n 2) and amputation (n 1) due to infected nonunion. There was also a symptomatic hardware removal. In normal vitaminsubgroup, reoperation indications included: malunion (n 1), elective dynamization before weightbearing (n 1), and symptomatic hardware removal (n 2). Normal vitaminsubgroup had zero nonunions. Conclusion: In patients undergoing ankle fusion, vitamindeficiency31 ng ml) was associated with a reoperation rate over double that of patients with normal vitaminlevels. In the vitamindeficient subgroup, nearly all reoperations were for nonunion as compared to zero nonunion incidence in those with normal vitaminlevels. These suggest routine preoperative screening of vitaminlevel is indicated as a key component of ankle fusion care. Vitaminsupplementation during the perioperative period may be indicated in regions with low sunlight to improve fusion rates and lower the risk of reoperation.",2020,2020-10-01,0,Foot & Ankle Orthopaedics,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Ramanathan, D.

"Mieg, H.A.",Volatility as a transmitter of systemic risk: is there a structural risk in finance,"This article discusses the role of volatility in the context of systemic risk in finance. The main argument is that volatility transmits risks within the financial system and beyond, shaking the financial system and threatening in particular small or vulnerable clients (SMEs, households, and also low- and middle-income countries). In addition, it is argued that volatility-induced threats result from structural characteristics of the financial markets themselves (reactivity, reflexivity, and recursivity). The article introduces the concept of volatility, and different approaches to understanding risks related to the financial system (e.g., financial analysis, systems analysis). Two cases related to systemic risk are presented. The first concerns the role of volatility in three major financial crises (stock crash 1987, Asian crisis 1996-1997, global banking crisis 2007-2008), documenting that volatility spillovers have become a ""new normal."" The second case concerns the moderate reflection of systemic risk within The Journal of Finance (the leading financial journal). The two cases show that volatility plays a role in systemic risks, but that this role has not yet been examined in detail by the scientific community.",2020,2020-07-23,12,Risk Analysis,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","Mieg, H.A.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether systemic factors have the same impact on wound healing as limb characteristics in CLI patients undergoing endovascular therapy. METHODS: A total of 735 patients who were treated for the first time for CLI with tissue loss between April 2010 and December 2015 were extracted from a prospective registry and data for the Wound, Ischaemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification were searched retrospectively. The predictors of wound healing were explored with Cox proportional hazards regression.The one year wound healing rate was 60.2% in WIfI stage 1-3 patients and 53.6% in WIfI stage(p .01). In WIfI stage 1-3, no systemic factors were significantly associated with wound healing, whereas, in WIfI stagepatients, non-ambulatory status hazard ratio (HR) 1.98 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37-2.84haemodialysis (HR 1.90 95% CI 1.33-2.72) and an albumin level under 3.0dL (HR 1.53 95% CI 1.02-2.31), were identified as independent risk factors for failure to achieve wound healing. If none or one of these risk factors were present, wound healing was comparable with WIfIand WIfI 1-3 patients (67.7% vs. 63.6%,.89), whereas in patients with two or more risk factors wound healing was worse in WIfIthan in WIfI 1-3 patients (35.7% vs. 49.5%,.01). CONCLUSION: Non-ambulatory status, haemodialysis, and a low albumin level were additional systemic risk factors for impaired wound healing in patients with WIfI stage 4.

"O'Halloran, S.; Nowaczyk, N.",An artificial intelligence approach to regulating systemic risk,"We apply an artificial intelligence approach to simulate the impact of financial market regulations on systemic risk-a topic vigorously discussed since the financial crash of 2007-09. Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations to avert another market collapse, such as the collateralization of interbank (counterparty) derivatives trades to mitigate systemic risk. A limiting factor is the availability of proprietary bank trading data. Even if this hurdle could be overcome, however, analyses would still be hampered by segmented financial markets where banks trade under different regulatory systems. We therefore adapt a simulation technology, combining advances in graph theoretic models and machine learning to randomly generate entire financial systems derived from realistic distributions of bank trading data. We then compute counterparty credit risk under various scenarios to evaluate and predict the impact of financial regulations at all levels-from a single trade to individual banks to systemic risk. We find that under various stress testing scenarios collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations. Moreover, the concentration of credit risk does not necessarily correlate monotonically with systemic risk. While the analysis focuses on counterparty credit risk, the method generalizes to other risks and metrics in a straightforward manner.",2019,2019-05-29,16,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4611 Machine Learning","O'Halloran, S.

Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. METHODS: We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Febto June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. FINDINGS: A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22 5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5 5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8 1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was973 (95% CI969-0 978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92 25% (90 10-94 12) and specificity of 89 04% (87 85-90 28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99 42% (99 15-99 68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97 19% (96 61-97 77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. INTERPRETATION: An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

So we aimed to study the correlation between stage of DR and DME with stage of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and stage of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and to explore the systemic risk factors for DR and DME. DESIGN AND SETTING: This single-centre retrospective observational study was conducted from December 2017 to November 2018. PARTICIPANTS: 413 southern Chinese patients with typediabetes mellitus. OUTCOME MEASURES: The correlations between stage of DR and DME with stage of eGFR UACR were assessed by Spearman's oranalyses and represented with histograms. Risk factors associated with the occurrence of DR and DME were performed by logistic regression and represented with nomograms.Stage of DR had a positive correlation with stage of eGFR (r 0.264,0.001) and stage of UACR (r 0.542,0.001). With the stage of eGFR UACR being more severe, the prevalence of DME became higher as well (both0.001). The risk factors for DR were DM duration (OR 1.072 95% CI 1.032 to 1.114 0.001), stage of UACR (OR 2.001 95% CI 1.567 to 2.555 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (OR 1.301 95% CI 1.139 to 1.485 0.001), while risk factors for DME were stage of UACR (OR 2.308 95% CI 1.815 to 2.934 0.001) and LDL (OR 1.460 95% CI 1.123 to 1.875 0.008).Among southern Chinese patients, stage of DR and DME were positively correlated with renal function, while stage of UACR performed a better relevance than stage of eGFR.",2019,2019-09-06,42,Bmj Open,"aged; albuminuria; china; creatinine; cross-sectional studies; diabetes mellitus, type 2; diabetic retinopathy; disease progression; female; glomerular filtration rate; humans; kidney; logistic models; macular edema; male; middle aged; prevalence; retrospective studies; risk factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Zhuang, X.

METHODS: The case-control study was included 150 controls and 66 cases with PCV. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), HDL, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein(APOB) together with systemic risk factors including gender, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) and asthma were identified. All subjects were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from three genes in the HDL metabolic pathway: rs10468017 of hepatic lipase (LIPC), rs12678919 of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), rs3764261 and rs173539 of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Student's t-tests, chi-square tests, anova and logistic regression were used to evaluate associations.Hyperlipidemia was a risk factor (odds ratio (OR) 1.19,0.001) for PCV. HDL, LDL and APOB levels were associated with PCV (OR 0.001,0.004 OR 0.099,0.010 OR 0.839,0.018). Higher level of TC was potently associated with increased risk of PCV (OR 109.8,0.000). LIPC rs10468017 was a risk factor for PCV (OR 11.68,0.000). CETP rs3764261 conferred a decreased risk for PCV (OR 0.08,0.000). No associations of LPL rs12678919 or CETP rs173539 with PCV were found. Mean level of HDL increased withallele of the CETP gene (p 0.026): 1.24 mmol( 0.31) for the GG genotype and 1.66 mmol( 0.54) for the TT genotype. Additionally,allele was associated with the following increase in APOA1: 136.78 mg dl20.53) for the CC genotype and 149.57 mg dl22.67) for the TT genotype of LIPC and 137.91 mg dl20.36) for the GG genotype and 162.67 mg dl22.50) for the TT genotype of CETP gene.

METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with Moraxella keratitis between November 2012 and December 2017 at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin, Ireland was performed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to identify Moraxella subspecies.Forty-one cases of Moraxella keratitis were identified. Previous ocular surgery and diabetes were the most common local and systemic risk factors. The most common appearance on presentation was an oval-shaped paracentral infiltrate with a mean diameter of 4.2 mm. Mean presenting and final logarithm of minimal angle of resolution visual acuity were 1.307 0.74 and 0.99 1.01, respectively. Surgical procedures, including penetrating keratoplasty, corneal glueing or evisceration, were required to manage nine (22%) patients. Mean time to complete corneal epithelialisation was 32 (range, 7-109) days and mean duration of topical antibiotic therapy was 54 (range, 9-124) days. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the following Moraxella subspecies: nonliquifaciens (16 39%), lacunata (15 36%), osloensis (4 10%) and catarrhalis (2 5%). In four cases (10%), subspecies analysis was inconclusive. M.nonliquifaciens and M. lacunata were associated with larger infiltrates on presentation (p 0.05), required more surgical intervention and longer treatment duration (p 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this large series of patients from Ireland, Moraxella keratitis was notable for its severity on presentation, slow response to antimicrobial therapy, high risk of surgical intervention and poor visual outcome.

A typical feature of erysipelas, especially on the lower limbs, is the tendency to reoccur and the study aimed to define the comorbidities associated with it. AIM: We aimed to investigate systemic and local comorbidities in patients diagnosed with erysipelas on the lower limbs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospectively-prospective, population-based cohort study which included all patients diagnosed with erysipelas on the lower limbs, during two years. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with first episode and patients with recurrent erysipelas. These two groups were compared, with particular emphasis on systemic and local comorbidities.The study included 313 patients, of which 187 with the first episode of erysipelas and 126 with a recurrent. Regarding the analyzed systemic risk factors, the recurrent erysipelas was significantly associated with obesity (p 0.0001), insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (p 0.0015), history of malignant disease (p 0.02) and tonsillectomy (p 0.000001).

In the framework of Debt Rank algorithm, we introduce an approximate method of systemic risk evaluation which requires only node properties, such as total assets and liabilities, as inputs. We demonstrate that this approximation captures a large portion of systemic risk measured by Debt Rank. Furthermore, using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate network structures that can amplify systemic risk. Indeed, while no topology in general sense is em a priori more stable if the market is liquid , a larger complexity is detrimental for the overall stability . Here we find that the measure of scalar assortativity correlates well with level of systemic risk. In particular, network structures with high systemic risk are scalar assortative, meaning that risky banks are mostly exposed to other risky banks. Network structures with low systemic risk are scalar disassortative, with interactions of risky banks with stable banks.",2019,2019-02-22,0,Arxiv,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Krause, S.M.

The rate and extent of thrombus formation can significantly impact patient presentation and the resulting clinical outcomes. The presentation of acute PVT can range from abdominal pain to intestinal ischemia infarction and even death, while chronic PVT can remain clinically silent. A number of imaging modalities including US, CT and MRI can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In addition to addressing underlying risk factors, AC therapy forms a cornerstone of treatment and has demonstrated efficacy in both acute and chronic settings. Proper caution should be used when initiating AC therapy in cirrhotic patients given their underlying coagulopathic status with attention now being paid to NOACs and LMWH.

Our empirical reveal that the Chinese banks' systemic risk contribution reached the highest level during the stock market crash in 2015. The panel regression imply that banks' size, leverage, loans, non-performing loans and demand deposits positively drive their systemic risk contribution, and ROA, loan-loss provisions and time deposits shows a negative relationship. Moreover, individual bank's VaR increase its systemic risk contribution, which means that the riskier individual bank contributes more to the systemic risk.

Most importantly, the study highlights the sector level variables munificence, dynamism and concentration are also important in comprehending the risk dynamics along with the much-emphasized firm and country level variables, notably size, political stability, and bank claims. The imply that the repercussions of excessive risk taking can be ameliorated by increasing liquidity requirements and having a close watch on leverage. Accordingly, monetary policy should be aligned with macro prudential policy to alleviate systemic risk. Furthermore, the Granger causality indicate that systemic risk engenders idiosyncratic risk and not vice versa, implying regulation of systemic risk can lower the idiosyncratic risk as well.

"Kuyyamudi, C.; Chakrabarti, A.S.; Sinha, S.",Emergence of frustration signals systemic risk,"We show that the emergence of systemic risk in complex systems can be understood from the evolution of functional networks representing interactions inferred from fluctuation correlations between macroscopic observables. Specifically, we analyze the long-term collective dynamics in the New York Stock Exchange, the largest financial market in the world, for almost a century and show that periods marked by systemic crisis are associated with emergence of frustration. This is indicated by the loss of structural balance in the networks of interaction between stocks. Moreover, the mesoscopic organization of the networks during these periods exhibits prominent core-periphery organization. This suggests an increased degree of coherence in the collective dynamics of the system, which is reinforced by our observation of the transition to delocalization in the dominant eigenmodes when the systemic risk builds up. While frustration has been associated with phase transitions in physical systems such as spin glasses, its role as a signal for systemic risk buildup leading to severe crisis as shown here provides a novel perspective into the dynamical processes leading to catastrophic failures in complex systems.",2019,2019-05-21,12,Physical Review E,,51 Physical Sciences,"Kuyyamudi, C.

We evaluated exposure of the plate in such reconstructions by comparing the of a radial forearm flap (RFF) with a vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap (VLMF). We also analysed the resection margins and the incidence of secondary osseous reconstructions after one year free from relapse. We retrospectively examined all 48 mandibular reconstructions in which a reconstruction plate and RFF or VLMF had been used between 2007 and 2016. Exposure rates of plates were assessed and local (size and site of resection) and systemic risk factors (age, sex, treatment with radiation, and smoking) evaluated. Reconstruction plates, together with a RFF, were significantly more likely to be exposed than those with a VLMF (p 0.01). There was significantly more exposure in the RFF group in mandibular defects larger thancm, in contrast to the VLMF group (p 0.002). Younger age (p 0.001), lower body mass index (BMI) (p 0.05) and smoking (p 0.011) led to more exposure. In seven cases a second operation was necessary due to macroscopically invaded or close margins. Thirty-one patients had no bony reconstruction because of local recurrence, distant metastases, inadequate resection margins, poor general condition, or a second (different) tumour. Exposure of the plate after mandibular reconstruction happens less often with the VLM flap than with the RFF.

The morphology of the carotid artery (CA) changes in response to atherosclerotic development by expansive remodeling (ER), the clinical significance of which remains unclear. This study aimed to define associations between ER and local risk factors, including CA geometry and traditional systemic risk factors for ischemic events, to determine whether ER could serve as a clinical marker of carotid vulnerable plaque. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 66 patients with CA stenosis who were scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy or CA stenting. They calculated ER ratios in the internal CA (ICA) from long-axis MR images and as the maximal distance between the lumen and the outer borders of the plaque perpendicular to the axis of the ICA the maximal luminal diameter of the distal ICA at a region unaffected by atherosclerosis. Relative overall signal intensity (roSI) was calculated to assess intraplaque hemorrhage and defined as the signal intensity of plaque on an axial T1-weighted image with maximal stenosis relative to that of the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle. The authors evaluated CA geometry by calculating the angles between the common CA (CCA) and ICA, and between the CCA and external CA (ECA) using digital subtraction angiography. The ER ratios, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, roSI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, low-density lipoprotein, statin medication, diabetes, smoking habit, and ischemic heart disease were compared between 33 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic patients. The authors also compared symptomatic status, age, sex, percentage of stenosis, ICA angle, ECA angle, roSI, and other traditional atherosclerotic risk factors between groups with extensive and slight ER.The ER ratio was significantly greater in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (1.91 0.46 vs 1.68 0.40,0.05). The ICA angle was significantly larger in the group with extensive ER than in those with slight ER (33.9 20.2 vs 21.7 13.8p 0.01). The roSI, ECA angle, percentage stenosis, or any other traditional vascular risk factors were not associated with ER.Carotid ER might be an independent indicator of carotid vulnerable plaque, which should be validated in a longitudinal study of patients with carotid atherosclerosis, including those with nonstenotic to moderate stenosis.",2019,2019-10-04,8,Journal of Neurosurgery,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,"Yoshida, K.

"Gatfaoui, H.; de, P.P.",Flickering in information spreading precedes critical transitions in financial markets,"As many complex dynamical systems, financial markets exhibit sudden changes or tipping points that can turn into systemic risk. This paper aims at building and validating a new class of early warning signals of critical transitions. We base our analysis on information spreading patterns in dynamic temporal networks, where nodes are connected by short-term causality. Before a tipping point occurs, we observe flickering in information spreading, as measured by clustering coefficients. Nodes rapidly switch between ""being in"" and ""being out"" the information diffusion process. Concurrently, stock markets start to desynchronize. To capture these features, we build two early warning indicators based on the number of regime switches, and on the time between two switches. We divide our data into two sub-samples. Over the first one, using receiver operating curve, we show that we are able to detect a tipping point about one year before it occurs. For instance, our empirical model perfectly predicts the Global Financial Crisis. Over the second sub-sample, used as a robustness check, our two statistical metrics also capture, to a large extent, the 2016 financial turmoil. Our suggest that our indicators have informational content about a future tipping point, and have therefore strong policy implications.",2019,2019-04-05,12,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","Gatfaoui, H.

When the hog supply chain node enterprises are subjected to external shocks, on the basis of the commercial credit relationship in the supply chain, the entire supply chain generates liquidity risks and systemic risks. We analyze the input and output of the hog supply chain node enterprises under the constraint of liquidity, construct the mathematical model, discuss the dynamic differences of liquidity constraints in different situations, and measures the commercial credit risk and anti-risk ability of the pig supply chain node enterprises. If the external shock is less than a certain value, the current profits of the hog enterprise can entirely make up for the loss caused by external shocks, and the production of the firm will return to its state of equilibrium. If the external shock is large enough, liquidity constraints will seriously restrict the production input of the enterprise, which then leads to a deceleration of production input and may ultimately result in bankruptcy.

Resources are not increasing despite a 5% increase in the numbers of PWD nationwide each year. We describe the rationale, design and methodology for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the safety, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of personalised variable-interval risk-based screening for DR. This is the first randomised trial of personalised screening for DR and the largest ophthalmic RCT in the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PWD attending seven screening clinics in the Liverpool Diabetic Eye Screening Programme were recruited into a single site RCT with a 1:1 allocation to individualised risk-based variable-interval or annual screening intervals. A risk calculation engine developed for the trial estimates the probability that an individual will develop referable disease (screen positive DR) within the next 6, 12 or 24 months using demographic, retinopathy and systemic risk factor data from primary care and screening programme records. Dynamic, secure, real-time data connections have been developed. The primary outcome is attendance for follow-up screening. We will test for equivalence in attendance rates between the two arms. Secondary outcomes are rates and severity of DR, visual outcomes, cost-effectiveness and health-related quality of life. The required sample size was 4460 PWD. Recruitment is complete, and the trial is in follow-up.

We quantify systemic risk as possible risk spillovers from individual firms to the economy by taking into account time-varying linkages between the firm and the economy. Based on a novel dataset that combines data on international trade and foreign direct investments with daily stock data for 67 Dutch listed companies from 2006 2015, our indicate that high systemic risk contributions are not only present in the financial sector, but also occur in other sectors of the economy. We find that firms within the financial sector are more capable than non-financial firms of reverting to their pre-financial crisis level of systemic risk contribution. Having examined the potential role globalization fulfills in determining systemic risk, we find two main opposing effects. First, firms in internationally trade-intensive sectors contribute less to systemic risk than firms in sectors with low trade intensity. Second, systemic risk rises when firms are engaged in foreign direct investment activity, suggesting that international networks and global supply chains contribute to systemic risk propagation. Our empirical imply that macro-prudential policy aimed at monitoring systemic risk should be extended to non-financial sectors and should take into consideration globalization measures, such as foreign direct investments and global supply chains.",2019,2019-09-01,16,Economic Modelling,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Van Cauwenberge, A.

Excessive credit growth, the main cause of financial crises, is reflected in the undercapitalization of the financial sector. Market-based measures of systemic risk such as SRISK, which stands for systemic risk, enable monitoring how such weakness emerges and progresses in real time. In this paper, we develop quantitative estimates of the level of systemic risk in the financial sector that precipitates a financial crisis. Common approaches to reduce leverage correspond to specific scaling of systemic risk measures. In an econometric framework that recognizes financial crises represent left tail events for the economy, we estimate the relationship between SRISK and the financial crisis severity for 23 developed countries. We develop a probability of crisis measure and an SRISK capacity measure based on our estimates. Our analysis highlights the important global externality whereby the risk of a crisis in one country is strongly influenced by the undercapitalization of the rest of the world.",2019,2019-08-27,20,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Engle, R.F.

"Giudici, P.; Hadji-Misheva, B.; Spelta, A.",Network based scoring models to improve credit risk management in peer to peer lending platforms,"Financial intermediation has changed extensively over the course of the last two decades. One of the most significant change has been the emergence of FinTech. In the context of credit services, fintech peer to peer lenders have introduced many opportunities, among which improved speed, better customer experience, and reduced costs. However, peer-to-peer lending platforms lead to higher risks, among which higher credit risk: not owned by the lenders, and systemic risks: due to the high interconnectedness among borrowers generated by the platform. This calls for new and more accurate credit risk models to protect consumers and preserve financial stability. In this paper we propose to enhance credit risk accuracy of peer-to-peer platforms by leveraging topological information embedded into similarity networks, derived from borrowers' financial information.

"Paige, E.K.; Spelman, D.",Nocardiosis:year experience at an australian tertiary hospital,"Nocardiosis has historically been reported in immunocompromised patients, but Australian epidemiological and antimicrobial susceptibility data are limited. AIM: To describe the epidemiology, diagnosis and initial treatment of nocardiosis in an Australian tertiary hospital overyears. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all positive cultures for Nocardia species from any site isolated at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, betweenJanuary 2010 and 31 December 2016 were identified, and corresponding laboratory data and medical records reviewed.Sixty-eight non-duplicate isolates were identified from 67 patients. Common predisposing factors were chronic lung disease (38 67 57%), organ, particularly lung, transplantation (13 67 19%) and solid organ malignancy (6 67 9%) 12% (8 67) of patients had no identifiable systemic risk factors. Seventy-nine percent (53 67) of patients had pulmonary nocardiosis only. Nocardia nova was the most commonly isolated species (20 68 29%). In 48% (32 67) of patients, Nocardia species were isolated only on specific mycobacterial media. All tested species were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and amikacin, with the majority (58 63 92%) susceptible to imipenem. All-cause mortality rates atand 12 months where data were available were 15% (10 66 patients) and 22% (14 64 patients) respectively. CONCLUSION: In the largest Australian series in 25 years, nocardiosis predominantly affected patients with chronic lung disease or impaired cell-mediated immunity. A significant proportion of organisms from pulmonary sites were isolated on mycobacterial culture media only, suggesting that its use may improve yield.

Current published clinical approaches focused on mechanical debridement, adjunctive antiseptic therapy, adjunctive antibiotic therapy, laser-assisted therapy, and combination approaches were included in this analysis.Nonsurgical therapy of periimplantitis may result in complete healing of the disease and the patient is then placed on a supportive maintenance program. If the disease is not resolved and surgical intervention is not an option, active nonsurgical retreatment may be considered. In many cases where disease is not resolved, surgical therapy or implant removal could be considered.Nonsurgical treatment of periimplantitis usually provides clinical improvements in reducing bleeding tendency and in some cases pocket reduction.

METHODS: A total of 178 POAG patients (89 eyes showing at leastoccurrences of DH and 89 age-matched control eyes with a minimum of 10 years' follow-up without DH) were included in a retrospective, case-control study. Ocular factors were evaluated by a retrospective chart review, and systemic factors were evaluated by a telephone survey. Associations between factors and recurrent DH were investigated by logistic regression analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to evaluate glaucoma progression and to identify the factors predictive of glaucoma progression.Univariate regression analysis revealed the association of recurrent DH with low baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) odds ratio (OR), 0.88 95% confidential interval (CI), 0.80-0.98 0.014lower percentage reduction of IOP (OR, 0.96 95% CI, 0.93-0.99 0.020), cold extremities (OR, 2.80 95% CI, 1.03-7.60 0.043), prone or lateral decubitus sleeping position (OR, 2.14 95% CI, 1.13-4.03 0.019), and sleeping disorders (OR, 2.33 95% CI, 1.05-5.15 0.037). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a lower percentage reduction in IOP (OR, 0.96 95% CI, 0.93-1.00 0.046) increased the risk of recurrent DH. The control group exhibited a greater cumulative probability of non-progression than the recurrent DH group (P 0.01, by log-rank test).

The more recent toxicological concerns regarding parabens are more imposing, stemming from the gravity of the noncutaneous adverse health effects for which they have been scrutinized for the past 20 years. These include endocrine activity, carcinogenesis, infertility, spermatogenesis, adipogenesis, perinatal exposure impact, and nonallergologic cutaneous, psychologic, and ecologic effects. To assert that parabens are safe for use as currently used in the cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical industries, all toxicological end points must be addressed. We seek to achieve perspective through this exercise: perspective for the professional assessing systemic risk of parabens by all routes of exposure. The data reviewed in this article strive to provide a balanced perspective for the consumer hopefully to allay concerns regarding the safety of parabens and facilitate an informed decision-making process. Based on currently available scientific information, claims that parabens are involved in the genesis or propagation of these controversial and important health problems are premature.

Despite strict control of systemic risk factors, a fraction of patients with diabetes develop PDR, suggesting the existence of other potential pathogenic factors underlying PDR. This study aimed to investigate the plasma metabotype of patients with PDR and to identify novel metabolite markers for PDR. Biomarkers identified from this study will provide scientific insight and new strategies for the early diagnosis and intervention of diabetic retinopathy.MethodsA total of 1024 patients with typediabetes were screened. To match clinical parameters between case and control subjects, patients with PDR (PDR,21) or those with a duration of diabetes of 10 years but without diabetic retinopathy (NDR,21) were assigned to the present case-control study. Distinct metabolite profiles of serum were examined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).The distinct metabolites between PDR and NDR groups were significantly enriched inKEGG pathways (P 0.1), namely, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, caffeine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, purine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, sulfur metabolism, sphingosine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. A total of 63 altered metabolites played important roles in these pathways. Finally,metabolites were selected as candidate biomarkers for PDR, namely, fumaric acid, uridine, acetic acid, and cytidine. The area under the curve for these biomarkers were 0.96, 0.95, 1.0, and 0.95, respectively.This study suggested that impairment in the metabolism of pyrimidines, arginine and proline were identified as metabolic dysregulation associated with PDR. And fumaric acid, uridine, acetic acid, and cytidine might be potential biomarkers for PDR. Fumaric acid was firstly reported as a novel metabolite marker with no prior reports of association with diabetes or diabetic retinopathy, which might provide insights into potential new pathogenic pathways for diabetic retinopathy.",2019,2019-05-28,44,Nutrition & Metabolism,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3205 Medical Biochemistry and Metabolomics; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Zhu, X.

We propose to measure the resilience of health care systems with respect to changes in the density of primary care providers. We develop a computational model on a 1-to-1 scale for a countrywide primary care sector based on patient-sharing networks. Nodes represent all primary care providers in a country links indicate patient flows between them. The removal of providers could cause a cascade of patient displacements, as patients have to find alternative providers. The model is calibrated with nationwide data from Austria that includes almost all primary care contacts overy. We assignproperties to every provider: the ""CareRank"" measures the average number of displacements caused by a provider's removal (systemic risk) as well as the fraction of patients a provider can absorb when others default (systemic benefit). Below a critical number of providers, large-scale cascades of patient displacements occur, and no more providers can be found in a given region. We quantify regional resilience as the maximum fraction of providers that can be removed before cascading events prevent coverage for all patients within a district. We find considerable regional heterogeneity in the critical transition point from resilient to nonresilient behavior. We demonstrate that health care resilience cannot be quantified by physician density alone but must take into account how networked systems respond and restructure in response to shocks. The approach can identify systemically relevant providers.",2019,2019-11-11,14,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,austria; computer simulation; delivery of health care; electronic health records; health personnel; health workforce; humans; primary health care,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,"Sardo, D.R.L.

However, relevant research has ignored the systemic risk in dynamic banking network systems and the effects of inter-bank lending ratio (the ratio of interbank lending assets to total assets) and the asset volatility on the systemic risk in the dynamic banking networks. For this, the present paper constructs a dynamic evolutional banking network system firstly, which contains the dynamic evolutional equation of banks’ assets and liabilities and the dynamic clear algorithm of banks default. Then we analyze the systemic risk in the dynamic evolutional banking network system. The show that when lending ratio is small, the systemic risk of the banking system will change greatly with different market volatility. The greater the volatility, the higher probability of default that are mainly basic default when the volatility is larger, it can reduce the systemic risk through increased lending ratios when the volatility is smaller, it need to reduce lending ratios to reduce the systemic risk when the volatility reaches a particular critical value, the relevant departments need to control other factors (such as capital adequacy ratio) to reduce the systemic risk.",2019,2019-01-27,1,,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Hong, F.

Further systemic risk factors are: supportive therapies, concomitant disease, way of life, individual factors. Local risk factors may be: dentoalveolar surgery, periapical and periodontal inflammation, ill-fitting denture, presence of some anatomical structures. The accumulation of risk factors determines the probability of the manifestation of osteonecrosis.

Global Ceacam1 gene deletion impaired insulin clearance to cause chronic hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance . It also caused spontaneous endothelial dysfunction and hypertension in addition to atherogenic-like plaques in addition to lipid and macrophage deposition, as well as elevated leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the aortic wall in the absence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia when the mutation was propagated on the C57BLgenetic . Because CEACAM1 promotes endothelial survival, vascular integrity, and pro-angiogenesis, we investigated the cell-autonomous role of endothelial cell CEACAM1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To this aim, we generated endothelial cell CEACAM1 knockout mice and backcrossed them with low density lipoprotein receptor deficient mice (ldlr VECad Cc1fl fl) prior to feeding them a high cholesterol diet formonths and characterizing both of their metabolic and vascular phenotypes. By comparison to ldlr mice, the mutants exhibited insulin sensitivity and moderate hypercholesterolemia. However, they exhibited decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability with a reciprocal increase in plasma endothelin-1 and increased oxidative stress. The mutants also developed fibrotic plaques with elevated macrophage recruitment on the aortic wall without lipid deposition. We postulate that endothelin-1 contributes to fibrosis in these mice. Elevated endothelin-1 levels could stem from increased ras-MAPKinase signaling pathways in response to lower sequestration of Shc and increased coupling of Grb2 to insulin and VEGR in the absence of Ceacam1. Moreover, in the absence of Ceacam1, binding of Shp2 phosphatase to IRS1 increases to reduce IRS-1 Akt eNOS activity and subsequently, lower NO production. Thus, the ldlr VECad Cc1fl fl mouse can provide an in vivo system to delineate the endothelial cell-specific CEACAM1 effect on fibrosis independent of systemic risk factors. References: 1.

"Valeriani, E.; Riva, N.; Di, N.M.; Ageno, W.",Splanchnic vein thrombosis: current perspectives,"Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) including portal, mesenteric, splenic vein thrombosis and the Budd-Chiari syndrome, is a manifestation of unusual site venous thromboembolism. SVT presents with a lower incidence than deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs and pulmonary embolism, with portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome being respectively the most and the least common presentations of SVT. SVT is classified as provoked if secondary to a local or systemic risk factor, or unprovoked if the causative trigger cannot be identified. Diagnostic evaluation is often affected by the lack of specificity of clinical manifestations: the presence of one or more risk factors in a patient with a high clinical suspicion may suggest the execution of diagnostic tests. Doppler ultrasonography represents the first line diagnostic tool because of its accuracy and wide availability. Further investigations, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography, should be executed in case of suspected thrombosis of the mesenteric veins, suspicion of SVT-related complications, or to complete information after Doppler ultrasonography. Once SVT diagnosis is established, a careful patient evaluation should be performed in order to assess the risks and benefits of the anticoagulant therapy and to drive the optimal treatment intensity. Due to the low quality and large heterogeneity of published data, guidance documents and expert opinion could direct therapeutic decision, suggesting which patients to treat, which anticoagulant to use and the duration of treatment.",2019,2019-10-01,57,Vascular Health and Risk Management,"anticoagulants; humans; mesenteric veins; portal vein; predictive value of tests; risk factors; splanchnic circulation; splenic vein; treatment outcome; ultrasonography, doppler; venous thrombosis",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Valeriani, E.

"Wong, T.Y.; Sabanayagam, C.",Strategies to tackle the global burden of diabetic retinopathy: from epidemiology to artificial intelligence,"Diabetes is a global public health disease projected to affect 642 million adults by 2040, with about 75% residing in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affectsinpeople with diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in working-aged adults. There arebroad strategic imperatives to prevent blindness caused by DR. Primary prevention requires preventing or delaying the onset of DR in those with diabetes by systems-level lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical activity or dietary modifications, pharmacological interventions for glycaemic and blood pressure control, and systematic screening for the onset of DR. Secondary prevention requires preventing the progression of DR in patients with DR by continuing systemic risk factor control, regular screening to monitor for the progression of mild DR to vision-threatening stages, and the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for managing DR. In this aspect, telemedicine-based DR screening incorporating artificial intelligence technology has the potential to facilitate more widespread and cost-effective screening, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Tertiary prevention of DR blindness has been the main focus of the clinical ophthalmology community, classically based on laser photocoagulation treatment and ocular surgery but with an increasing use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) for vision-threatening DR. Evidence from serial epidemiological studies shows blindness due to DR has declined in high-income countries (e.g., the USA and UK) due to coordinated public health education efforts, increased awareness, early detection by DR screening, sustained systemic risk factor control, and the availability of effective tertiary level treatment. However, the progress made in reducing DR blindness in high-income countries may be overwhelmed by the increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and DR in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, etc.). Thus, to tackle DR at a global level, a paradigm shift in strategic focus from tertiary towards secondary and primary prevention measures with a multi-pronged whole-of-society approach at regional and national levels is urgently needed.",2019,2019-08-13,130,Ophthalmologica,artificial intelligence; diabetic retinopathy; global health; humans; mass screening; morbidity; risk factors; telemedicine,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Wong, T.Y.

"Středová, M.; Hejsek, L.; Nekolová, J.; Jirásková, N.","Suprachoroideal haemorrhage in postoperative period of antiglaucoma surgery, case report","Suprachoroidal haemorrhage (SCH) is a serious complication of intraocular procedures. Physiologically there is only a minimal amount of fluid in the suprachoroid space, pathologically the fluid volume increases, which causes ablation of the choroid. SCH could be divided into different cathegories, according to the character of the fluid into serous and haemorrhagic by the time of occurrence in relation to the surgery into peroperative and postoperative. Diagnosis is based on biomicroscopic and ultrasound examinations. The ocular risk factors for SCH are glaucoma, myopia and aphakia systemic risk factors include vascular fragility, arterial hypertension and blood coagulation disorders. In the pathogenesis hypotonia of the eye, that causes rupture of the ciliary vessels, plays a very important role. SCH can be treated both conservatively and surgically. As to pharmacotherapy we use gabapentin to suppress neuropathic pain and prednisone, topical mydriatics and anti-inflammatory agents. The type of surgical treatment differs according to time of occurrence, if SCH occurs during the operation, the intervention consists mainly in the wound closure and the repositioning of the weakening tissues in postoperative forms, we choose drainage procedures, possibly vitreoretinal procedures. Our patient, an 80-year-old myop and chronic glaucomatic treated intensively both topically and systematically underwent trabeculectomy on his left eye due to unsatisfactory intraocular pressure (IOP) and significant glaucoma progression. The surgical intervention went without any complications. In the early post-operative period, there was persisting elevation of IOP, therefore sclera lap was discontinued and 5-fluorouracil was applied under the filter blister. Subsequent hypotonia caused a hemorrhagic SCH with intraocular hypertension, which was resolved by draining the blood with sclerotomias and thus releasing intraocular hypertension. The visual acuity of the left eye gradually improved to almost original values. Intraocular pressure, however, is not well compensated despite many following antiglaucoma surgeries. Therefore, even with the patients maximum therapy, glaucoma continues to progress. In our case, we confirm that it is possible to solve even the relatively most complicated cases of SCH. We stress the necessity to consider the presence of risk factors of the occurrence of SCH before indicating intraocular procedures and also recommend thinking carefully about other less invasive surgical techniques. In glaucoma, it is appropriate taking in account the prediction of life compared to the expected rate of progression of vision loss.",2019,2019-02-21,1,Czech and Slovak Ophthalmology,"aged, 80 and over; choroid hemorrhage; glaucoma; humans; intraocular pressure; postoperative complications; tonometry, ocular; trabeculectomy; treatment outcome",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Středová, M.

"Stout, A.; Friedly, J.; Standaert, C.J.",Systemic absorption and side effects of locally injected glucocorticoids,"Local glucocorticoid injections are often used to treat joint, soft tissue, or spinal pain, but the systemic side effects associated with these injections are poorly understood and not well recognized. There are significant known risks to systemic administration of glucocorticoids. However, there are no guidelines that address issues of systemic absorption, overall systemic risks, or other side effects of locally injected glucocorticoids. For this review, a literature search was performed, and the available evidence on systemic absorption and clinical side effects of intra-articular and epidural glucocorticoids was synthesized. The goal was to improve clinical understanding of risks associated with these injections. Existing data suggest there is significant individual variability in the amount of systemic absorption and clinical effects of locally injected glucocorticoids. However, it is clear that both intra-articular and epidural injections can have systemic effects for weeks and that complications may be associated with their use, including Cushing syndrome, loss of bone density, infection, and hyperglycemia. The concurrent use of oral steroids, the number of injections, and the type and dose of glucocorticoids used all are important considerations in estimating risks. The total dose calculation of cumulative glucocorticoid exposure should include all local injections. Caution should be exercised when local glucocorticoid injections are used in higher risk patients, such as postmenopausal women, people with diabetes, and those considering surgery in the near term. Better provider awareness of possible systemic risks should improve decision making and informed consent with patients when considering intra-articular and epidural steroid injections for painful conditions.

The analysis of the structure of investment portfolios is a major application since their eventual correlation and overlap impact the actual risk by individual investors. We investigate the bipartite network of US mutual fund portfolios and their assets. We follow its evolution during the Global Financial Crisis and study the diversification, as understood in modern portfolio theory, and the similarity of the investments of different funds. We show that, on average, portfolios have become more diversified and less similar during the crisis. However, we also find that large overlap is far more likely than expected from benchmark models of random allocation of investments. This indicates the existence of strong correlations between fund investment strategies. We exploit a deliberately simplified model of shock propagation to identify a systemic risk component stemming from the similarity of portfolios. The network is still partially vulnerable after the crisis because of this effect, despite the increase in the diversification of multi asset portfolios.

The result from the regressions shows that credit risk and liquidity risk significantly affect systemic risk at the market distress. Meanwhile, credit risk and liquidity risk do not affect systemic risk of individual bank. The crisis affects systemic risk is showed by two regressions which are conducted in four ASEAN banks.

Success should include not only survival but also lack of mechanical, biological, and esthetics problems.

This review discusses the role of controlling different risk factors and prevention treatment of peri-implant mucositis in order to avoid peri-implantitis. Although the literature addressing the topic is still scarce, the existing evidence shows that performing optimal plaque control and regular visits to the dentist seem to be adequate to prevent peri-implant lesions. Due to impossibility of defining a probing depth associate with peri-implant health, radiographic evaluations may be considered in the daily practice.

This new criterion, already validated on continuous and binary data, is extended also to the case of discrete data providing which are coherent to those obtained with the classical predictive accuracy measures. To shed light on the usefulness of our approach, we apply Poisson autoregressive models with exogenous covariates (PARX) to the quarterly count of defaulted loans among Italian real estate and construction companies, comparing the performance of several specifications.

"Diem, C.; Pichler, A.; Thurner, S.",What is the minimal systemic risk in financial exposure networks,"Management of systemic risk in financial markets is traditionally associated with setting (higher) capital requirements for market participants. There are indications that while equity ratios have been increased massively since the financial crisis, systemic risk levels might not have lowered, but even increased. It has been shown that systemic risk is to a large extent related to the underlying network topology of financial exposures. A natural question arising is how much systemic risk can be eliminated by optimally rearranging these networks and without increasing capital requirements. Overlapping portfolios with minimized systemic risk which provide the same market functionality as empirical ones have been studied by pichler2018Here we propose a similar method for direct exposure networks, and apply it to cross-sectional interbank loan networks, consisting of 10 quarterly observations of the Austrian interbank market. We show that the suggested framework rearranges the network topology, such that systemic risk is reduced by a factor of approximately 3.5, and leaves the relevant economic features of the optimized network and its agents unchanged.

"Petrone, D.; Latora, V.",A dynamic approach merging network theory and credit risk techniques to assess systemic risk in financial networks,"The interconnectedness of financial institutions affects instability and credit crises. To quantify systemic risk we introduce here the PD model, a dynamic model that combines credit risk techniques with a contagion mechanism on the network of exposures among banks. A potential loss distribution is obtained through a multi-period Monte Carlo simulation that considers the probability of default (PD) of the banks and their tendency of defaulting in the same time interval. A contagion process increases the PD of banks exposed toward distressed counterparties. The systemic risk is measured by statistics of the loss distribution, while the contribution of each node is quantified by the new measures PDRank and PDImpact. We illustrate how the model works on the network of the European Global Systemically Important Banks. For a certain range of the banks’ capital and of their assets volatility, our reveal the emergence of a strong contagion regime where lower default correlation between banks corresponds to higher losses. This is the opposite of the diversification benefits postulated by standard credit risk models used by banks and regulators who could therefore underestimate the capital needed to overcome a period of crisis, thereby contributing to the financial system instability.",2018,2018-04-03,26,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Petrone, D.

These frontiers include integrated assessments, dealing with climate risks across borders and scales, addressing systemic risks, and innovative co-production methods to prioritize solutions to climate challenges with decision-makers. By reviewing recent developments in the use of large-scale risk assessment for adaptation policy-making, we suggest a forward-looking research agenda to meet ongoing strategic policy requirements in local, national and international contexts.This article is part of the theme issue 'Advances in risk assessment for climate change adaptation policy'.",2018,2018-04-30,88,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society a Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences,,41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,"Adger, W.N.

Total arsenic, cadmium and lead concentrations in fresh and processed tuna (110 samples) marketed in Galicia (NW Spain) were determined by ICP-MS spectrometry. The average concentrations of As and Cd, 3.78 and 0.024 mg kg-1 w.w., respectively, in fresh tuna were statistically significantly higher than those in processed tuna (p natural pickled sauce. Of the two species studied in canned tuna, Thunnus alalunga showed statistically significant higher levels both for As 1.28 mg kg-1 (p 0.001) and Pb 0.013 mg kg-1 (p 0.0496) than Thunnus albacares. No samples surpassed the limits set by the EU for Cd and Pb. The limit for As in fish has not been established, but the arsenic contents in fresh tuna reported here are important, as they are among the highest reported in the literature. Considering public health in children and adults with respect to the investigated metals, the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) did not exceed the tolerable intakes. No chronic systemic risk was found since all the target hazard quotients (THQs-TTHQs) were far below(critical value), and the carcinogenic risk (CR) for As did not exceed the acceptable value of 10-5. Thus, tuna consumption in the Galician diet does not pose a risk for different population groups in terms of these studied metals metalloids.",2018,2018-02-03,39,the Science of the Total Environment,"animals; arsenic; cadmium; dietary exposure; food contamination; humans; lead; mercury; metals, heavy; risk assessment; seafood; spain; tuna; water pollutants, chemical",41 Environmental Sciences; 4105 Pollution and Contamination,"Núñez, R.

"Brown, I.",Assessing climate change risks to the natural environment to facilitate cross-sectoral adaptation policy,"Climate change policy requires prioritization of adaptation actions across many diverse issues. The policy agenda for the natural environment includes not only biodiversity, soils and water, but also associated human benefits through agriculture, forestry, water resources, hazard alleviation, climate regulation and amenity value. To address this broad agenda, the use of comparative risk assessment is investigated with reference to statutory requirements of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment. Risk prioritization was defined by current adaptation progress relative to risk magnitude and implementation lead times. Use of an ecosystem approach provided insights into risk interactions, but challenges remain in quantifying ecosystem services. For all risks, indirect effects and potential systemic risks were identified from land-use change, responding to both climate and socio-economic drivers, and causing increased competition for land and water resources. Adaptation strategies enhancing natural ecosystem resilience can buffer risks and sustain ecosystem services but require improved cross-sectoral coordination and recognition of dynamic change. To facilitate this, risk assessments need to be reflexive and explicitly assess decision outcomes contingent on their riskiness and adaptability, including required levels of human intervention, influence of uncertainty and ethical dimensions. More national-scale information is also required on adaptation occurring in practice and its efficacy in moderating risks.This article is part of the theme issue 'Advances in risk assessment for climate change adaptation policy'.",2018,2018-04-30,17,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society a Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences,climate change; conservation of natural resources; environment; intersectoral collaboration; policy; risk assessment; united kingdom,38 Economics; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4101 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation,"Brown, I.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study set at the Lo Fong Siu Po Eye Centre (Grantham Hospital), Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 80 Chinese participants, aged 18 or above, with T2DM recruited from the specialist outpatient setting were included. METHODS: The Oculus Keratograph 5M (Oculus Inc., Wetzlar, Germany) was used to measure the non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT). Ocular symptoms were evaluated using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). The association between OSDI, NITBUT and metabolic parameters relating to diabetes were evaluated using multiple linear regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The associations between long-term glycaemic control and NITBUT and OSDI scores.Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed glycated haemoglobin to be the only significant independent variable for NITBUT (R2 0.099,0.014) and OSDI (R2 0.062,0.044) after controlling for potential confounders. The age-adjusted prevalence of DES was 20% (95% confidence interval: 11-30%) in the Chinese T2DM population. The odds of DES for increasing percentage of glycated haemoglobin was 1.49 (95% confidence interval: 1.03-2.17,0.04).

METHODS: 42 patients (22 male and 20 female) were recruited from January 2016 to December 2017. Intravenous methylprednisolone and or intratympanic corticosteroid were used as salvage therapy. The main measures included systemic risk factors and audiometric outcomes as proposed by American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Hearing Loss Scale. All individuals were assessed at baseline, discharge (2 weeks post-treatment) and at 1,andmonths.The mean ages of patients were 39.3 14.8 yrs. Cardiovascular disorders were seen in 19.0-33.3% of cases. Restoration of hearing and speech discrimination abilities were assessed at the first month post-treatment versus initial levels (95.5 15.5 vs. 109.2 9.6 dB,0.000 and 17.6 24.4 vs. 1.3 4.0%,0.003, respectively).

Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until ""everything is connected to everything else"" poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her his connected surrogates. We propose Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal-in that they allow ""digital detox"" by employing pathways unrelated unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material article trails on vital medical information (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: ""Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research"" (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking. Industry 5.0 is poised to harness extreme automation and Big Data with safety, innovative technology policy, and responsible implementation science, enabled by 3D symmetry in innovation ecosystem design.",2018,2018-01-02,236,Omics a Journal of Integrative Biology,artificial intelligence; big data; humans; internet; technology,31 Biological Sciences,"Özdemir, V.

The aim of our study was to investigate whether carotid bifurcation geometry as assessed by ultrasound is associated with early carotid atherosclerosis, regardless of the presence of known atherosclerotic risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nonrandomized prospective study was undertaken, including subjects of both genders, aged 50-60 years, without known cardiovascular family history, and symptoms and or signs of cardiovascular disease. Clinical assessment and ultrasound of the carotid bifurcation evaluating geometrical characteristics, ultrasonic biopsy score (UBS), intima-media thickness (IMT), and the presence of plaque were recorded.Two hundred one subjects (95 men 106 women mean age: 55 years) provided 286 carotid bifurcations associated with atherosclerotic risk factors and 114 without (one poor imaging). While UBS in the right common carotid artery (CCA) was higher in subjects with atherosclerotic risk factors but free of plaque (P 0.035), larger diameter of the bulb (dBULB) (P 0.001), lower ratios of internal carotid artery diameter external carotid artery diameter diameter of CCAdICA dECA dCCA) (P 0.004), and (dICA2 dECA2) dCCA2 (P 0.025) were independently associated with higher CCA IMT. The presence of plaque among the total 400 carotid bifurcations was associated in the left and right CCA with lower values of bulb diameter dCCA (dBULB dCCA) (P 0.014) and (dICA dECA) dCCA (P 0.001), respectively. Among subjects without atherosclerotic risk factors (n 114), the presence of plaque in the right CCA was associated with lower values of (dBULB dECA) dCCA (P 0.001) and that in the left with lower values of dBULB dCCA (P 0.001).Different dimensional ratios of the carotid bifurcation assessed by ultrasound are associated with the development of early carotid atherosclerosis independently from the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors.

Informed by principal components analysis,composite categories were created: oral rule-breaking risks (eg, mouth cancer, getting in trouble), systemic risks (eg, heart attack), and benefits (eg, relaxation). Standardized composite scores and harm ratings were compared by product and by tobacco use status.Cigarettes were perceived as likely to impart oral rule-breaking risks and systemic risks, unlikely to cause benefits, and as very harmful overall. ST was perceived similarly as cigarettes regarding oral rule-breaking risks, but less likely to cause systemic risks, and more beneficial. Most participants rated cigarettes as more harmful than ST. Similar patterns existed in all tobacco use groups, including non-users and dual-users.In this population, cigarettes were perceived as very harmful.

Their citations (165,133) were 82% of the total. The proportion of annual papers scored as three was initially high, as were their citations but declined to almost zero by 1996, before rising slightly from 2006.The enormous expansion of the literature appropriately reflects increased understanding of the importance of climate change to global health.

Based on data for the period from 2011 to 2015, we perform an analysis in two steps. In the first step, we measure the systemic risk in Brazil based on ΔCoVaR framework. In the second step, we present empirical evidence from a panel data analysis regarding the determinants (banking and macroeconomic variables) of the systemic risk. The findings denote that the systemic risk measured using the ΔCoVaR methodology is consistent with the main events contained in the Financial Stability Reports issued by the Central Bank of Brazil. Furthermore, the empirical evidence highlights the importance of bank liquidity, profitability, leverage, and interest rate in determining systemic risk.

This method might help to assess microangiopathy in diabetic retinopathy during screening and follow-up. AIM: To quantify retinal microvasculature alterations in both eyes of diabetic patients in relation to systemic risk factors using optical coherence tomography angiography. METHOD: Both eyes of 36 diabetic patients and 45 individuals without diabetes were examined. Duration of diabetes, insulin therapy, blood pressure, HbA1c, dyslipidemia, axial length and the presence of diabetic retinopathy were recorded. Retinal vessel density was measured by optical coherence tomography angiography. The effect of risk factors on vessel density and between-eye asymmetry was assessed using multivariable regression analysis.Vessel density was significantly lower and between-eye difference was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to controls (p 0.05). Both vessel density and between-eye asymmetry significantly correlated with diabetes duration (p 0.05) after controlling for the effect of risk factors. The between-eye asymmetry in vessel density was significantly higher in patients without clinically detectable diabetic retinopathy compared to control subjects (p 0.001).There is a decrease in retinal vessel density and an increase in between-eye asymmetry in patients with diabetes compared to healthy subjects. By using optical coherence tomography angiography, the detection of these microvascular alterations is possible before clinically detectable diabetic retinopathy and might serve as a useful tool in both screening and timing of treatment.

"Acan, D.; Karahan, E.; Kocak, N.; Kaynak, S.",Evaluation of systemic risk factors in different optical coherence tomographic patterns of diabetic macular edema,"AIM: To elucidate the relationship between systemic risk factors and different patterns of diabetic macular edema (DME) determined with optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, DME was classified by OCT as diffuse retinal thickness (DRT), cystoid macular edema (CME) and serous retinal detachment (SRD) and the relationship between the systemic risk factors and DME patterns was evaluated.Of the 57 patients with DME, 21 (36.8%) had DRT, 24 (42.1%) had CME and 12 (21.0%) had SRD. Micro- or macro-albuminuria was significantly higher in the DRT pattern (61.9%) compared with the SRD (50.0%) and CME patterns (25.0% 0.040). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was significantly higher and patients were younger in the DRT pattern group (P 0.034,0.032). Best corrected visual acuity was the worst and central macular thickness was the thickest in the CME pattern group. CONCLUSION: Micro- or macro-albuminuria may be more frequent and HbA1c level may be higher in patients with DRT. These patients are also seen to be younger than patients with non-DRT.",2018,2018-07-18,13,International Journal of Ophthalmology,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Acan, D.

"Burkholz, R.; Herrmann, H.J.; Schweitzer, F.",Explicit size distributions of failure cascades redefine systemic risk on finite networks,"How big is the risk that a few initial failures of nodes in a network amplify to large cascades that span a substantial share of all nodes Predicting the final cascade size is critical to ensure the functioning of a system as a whole. Yet, this task is hampered by uncertain and missing information. In infinitely large networks, the average cascade size can often be estimated by approaches building on local tree and mean field approximations. Yet, as we demonstrate, in finite networks, this average does not need to be a likely outcome. Instead, we find broad and even bimodal cascade size distributions. This phenomenon persists for system sizes up to 107 and different cascade models, i.e. it is relevant for most real systems. To show this, we derive explicit closed-form solutions for the full probability distribution of the final cascade size. We focus on two topological limit cases, the complete network representing a dense network with a very narrow degree distribution, and the star network representing a sparse network with a inhomogeneous degree distribution. Those topologies are of great interest, as they either minimize or maximize the average cascade size and are common motifs in many real world networks.",2018,2018-05-02,16,Scientific Reports,,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 51 Physical Sciences,"Burkholz, R.

Prominent examples are MES, SRISK or ΔCoVaR. Based on a simulation study in an extended banking network model that incorporates several sources of systemic risk, we analyze how well these systemic risk measures perform in indicating the risk of a systemic event. For this analysis, the systemic risk measures of the banks that default and whose default is followed by a systemic event are compared with the systemic risk measures of those defaulting banks for which no subsequent systemic event can be observed. Within the simulation study, we find that many bank-individual systemic risk measures are statistically significant in explaining the likelihood of a systemic event after a bank’s default.

"Rovira, J.; Domingo, J.L.",Human health risks due to exposure to inorganic and organic chemicals from textiles: A review,"It is well known that a number of substances used in the textile industry can mean not only environmental, but also health problems. The scientific literature regarding potential adverse health effects of chemical substances in that industry is mainly related with human exposure during textile production. However, information about exposure of consumers is much more limited. Although most research on the health effects of chemicals in textiles concern allergic skin reactions, contact allergy is not the only potential human health problem. In this paper, we have reviewed the current scientific information regarding human exposure to chemicals through skin-contact clothes. The review has been focused mainly on those chemicals whose probabilities of being detected in clothes were rather higher. Thus, we have revised the presence of flame retardants, trace elements, aromatic amines, quinoline, bisphenols, benzothiazoles benzotriazoles, phthalates, formaldehyde, and also metal nanoparticles. Human dermal exposure to potentially toxic chemicals through skin-contact textiles clothes shows a non-negligible presence in some textiles, which might lead to potential systemic risks.

"Poledna, S.; Hinteregger, A.; Thurner, S.",Identifying systemically important companies by using the credit network of an entire nation,"The notions of systemic importance and systemic risk of financial institutions are closely related to the topology of financial liability networks. In this work, we reconstruct and analyze the financial liability network of an entire economy using data of 50,159 firms and banks. Our analysis contains 80.2% of the total liabilities of firms towards banks and all interbank liabilities in the Austrian banking system. The combination of firm-bank networks and interbank networks allows us to extend the concept of systemic risk to the real economy. In particular, the systemic importance of individual companies can be assessed, and for the first time, the financial ties between the financial and the real economy become explicitly visible. We find that firms contribute to systemic risk in similar ways as banks do. We identify a set of mid-sized companies that carry substantial systemic risk. Their default would affect up to 40% of the Austrian financial market. We find that all firms together create more systemic risk than the entire financial sector. In 2008, the total systemic risk of the Austrian interbank network amounted to only 29% of the total systemic risk of the entire financial network consisting of firms and banks. The work demonstrates that the notions of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) can be directly extended to firms.",2018,2018-10-16,16,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Poledna, S.

In this study, we identified odor compounds in urine obtained from IC patients and healthy controls. Using comprehensive solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-TOF-MS) profiling and bioinformatics, we found that levels of urinary volatile metabolites, such as menthol, were significantly reduced in IC patients, compared to healthy controls. In an attempt to understand the mechanistic meaning of our volatile metabolites data and the role of menthol in the immune system, we performed two independent experiments: (a) cytokine profiling, and (b) DNA microarray. Our findings suggest that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory events, such as the production and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and the activation of NF-κB and associated proteins within a large signaling network (e.g., Akt, TLR1, TNFAIP3, and NF-κB), are suppressed by the presence of menthol.

"Ellinas, C.",Modelling indirect interactions during failure spreading in a project activity network,"Spreading broadly refers to the notion of an entity propagating throughout a networked system via its interacting components. Evidence of its ubiquity and severity can be seen in a range of phenomena, from disease epidemics to financial systemic risk. In order to understand the dynamics of these critical phenomena, computational models map the probability of propagation as a function of direct exposure, typically in the form of pairwise interactions between components. By doing so, the important role of indirect interactions remains unexplored. In response, we develop a simple model that accounts for the effect of both direct and subsequent exposure, which we deploy in the novel context of failure propagation within a real-world engineering project. We show that subsequent exposure has a significant effect in key aspects, including the: (a) final spreading event size, (b) propagation rate, and (c) spreading event structure. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of hidden influentials’ in large-scale spreading events, and evaluate the role of direct and subsequent exposure in their emergence. Given the evidence of the importance of subsequent exposure, our findings offer new insight on particular aspects that need to be included when modelling network dynamics in general, and spreading processes specifically.",2018,2018-03-12,11,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Ellinas, C.

The only report of such a case in an osteoporosis patient found in current literature was related to short-term bisphosphonate but long time corticosteroid and methotrexate treatment.Case presentationIn this article, we report a case of necrotizing fasciitis secondary to osteonecrosis of the jaw related to long-term oral bisphosphonate treatment in an osteoporosis patient additionally suffering from poorly controlled typediabetes. Diabetes mellitus not only has been reported to be a systemic risk factor regarding BRONJ but also to be the most common comorbidity in patients presenting with necrotizing fasciitis and to increase mortality of this condition. Necrotizing fasciitis and BRONJ in the patient could eventually be resolved by a surgical approach and intravenous antibiotic therapy.The case presented suggests diabetes mellitus potentially having been an important factor in the particularly unfavorable course of therapy. It emphasizes the importance of an adequate therapy and surveillance of modifiable systemic risk factors like diabetes mellitus in patients being at risk for development of BRONJ.

The study elaborates ocular and systemic risk factors of NTG in the South Indian population. It determines the correlation between risk factors and severity of glaucomatous damage. Methods This descriptive study was done on 81 eyes of 41 patients. A brief history of hypertension, heart disease, migraine, and family history of glaucoma were noted. The parameters measured include blood pressure, lipid profile, visual acuity, refraction, intraocular pressure (IOP) by applanation tonometry, diurnal variation, slit lamp biomicroscopy, central corneal thickness (CCT), and perimetry (Humphrey 24-2). The mean age was 51.75 years. There was female predilection (63.41%). Thirteen patients (32.5%) had hypertension, five (12.5%) had migraine, and seven had hyperlipidemia (17.5%). Perfusion pressure demonstrated a negative correlation value of -0.319 (rho value) with visual field defects (p 0.05) and -0.266 (rho value) with glaucomatous cupping (p 0.093). The IOP varied from 10 mmHg to 19 mmHg with a mean of 15.34. The average CCT was 522.06 36.09 microns. Neuroretinal rim thinning was seen in 12 eyes (14.8%), polar notching in six eyes (7.4%), and peripapillary atrophy in 20 eyes (24.6%). Two eyes (2.4%) had splinter hemorrhage at disc margin. A lower value of CCT was associated with lower IOP, a weak positive correlation (r value 0.121). Optic disc cupping is strongly associated with severity of field defects,value 0.743, (p 0.00). Conclusion Normal tension glaucoma is common in females. Hypertension and lower diastolic perfusion pressure are important risk factors.

The optimal adjuvant treatment for early-stage patients is unclear. Our was to evaluate the outcomes of stage IA serous endometrial cancers only treated at a single institution and determine whether our current approach of chemotherapy plus vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) is sufficient. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of our institution's pathology database, including all cases of stage IA serous endometrial carcinoma from 2000-2014 was completed. Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for Overall and Recurrence-Free Survival (OS and RFS) hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling for independent prognostic factors.There were 63 patients with stage IA serous endometrial cancer of whom 79.4% were surgically staged. Percent RFS was 76.5% at five years while OS was 84.7% for the whole cohort. One of the 23 patients receiving VBT and chemotherapy recurred at the vagina versus four of 32 patients who were observed. Two patients in the observation group recurred in the pelvis while there were no first pelvic recurrences in the VBT and chemotherapy group (non- significant). Overall survival was 95% in the brachytherapy and chemotherapy group versus 79.6% in the observation group (non-significant). Post-operative management included observation (n 33), combination VBT and chemotherapy (n 21), or chemotherapy with or without external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (n 9). DISCUSSION: We report one of the largest cohorts of serous endometrial cancer stage IA patients. Our emphasize the inferior RFS and OS of stage IA serous versus endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. While some centers continue to use EBRT for these patients, our demonstrate low pelvic recurrence rates with radiotherapy limited to VBT, as well as the high systemic risk regardless of treatment.

"Mafimisebi, O.P.",Risky business: data on trading results for UK general insurance firms during and after the global financial crisis,"This article contains dataset on the trading for UK general insurance industry performance during and after the global financial crisis. The data covers the net written premiums by line of business and trading for UK general insurance firms over a decade period (2007-2016). Additionally, the data comprises areas that are peculiar to evaluate general insurance business such as net written premiums, underwritingclaims incurred, investment income and trading which makes it important to investigate the probability of default of different business lines and insolvency risk. The data presented could serve as useful tool to supervise local insurance firms and take earlier action in the case of risky firms before they breach solvency capital requirements. The data are useful to evaluate growth performance of UK non-life insurance industry which can be compare with other countries. Likewise, the data analysis can allow for measurement of insurance firms competitiveness and detect systemic risk which may disrupt the financial industry. The uniqueness of this data is its focus on insurance business as risky which is an area where Solvency II concentrates on as a risk-based approach to prevent the failure of insurance firms. The failure of insurance companies may disrupt the financial industry, increase systemic risk and affect negatively the real economy. Therefore, the extent to which the determinants of insolvency risk for UK general insurance firms can be established the better the attractiveness of the sector and improve risk regulation.",2018,2018-11-26,3,Data in Brief,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Mafimisebi, O.P.

METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with SCD and 30 matched controls underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and automated thickness measurement for each retinal layer thicknesses for SCD patients were then compared to normal controls. Demographic data, systemic data, and lab were collected for each SCD patient multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential risk factors for sickle cell maculopathy.Ongoing chelation treatment (p 0.0187) was the most predictive factor for the presence of sickle cell maculopathy the odds were 94.2% lower when chelation was present. HbF level tended to influence sickle cell maculopathy (p 0.0775) the odds decreased by 12.9% when HbF increased by 1%. Sickle cell maculopathy was detected in 43% of SCD patients as patchy areas of retinal thinning on SD-OCT thickness map, mostly located temporally to the macula, especially in eyes with more advanced forms of sickle cell retinopathy (p 0.003). In comparison to controls, SCD patients had a subtle thinning of the overall macula and temporal retina compared to controls (most0.0001), involving inner and outer retinal layers. Thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium was also detected in SCD eyes (p 0.0001).Chronic chelation therapy and, potentially, high levels of HbF are possible protective factors for the presence of sickle cell maculopathy, especially for patients with more advanced forms of sickle cell retinopathy. A subtle thinning of the overall macula occurs in SCD patients and involves multiple retinal layers, suggesting that ischemic vasculopathy may happen in both superficial and deep capillary plexi. Thinning of the outer retinal layers suggests that an ischemic insult of the choriocapillaris may also occur in SCD patients.",2018,2018-03-01,20,Plos One,"adult; aged; anemia, sickle cell; chelation therapy; female; fetal hemoglobin; fluorescein angiography; humans; macula lutea; male; middle aged; odds ratio; retinal diseases; risk factors; tomography, optical coherence; young adult",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Dell’Arti, L.

However, local processes in the artery wall are becoming increasingly recognized to exacerbate atherosclerosis both in mice and humans. We show that arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) glucose metabolism markedly synergizes with metabolic syndrome in accelerating atherosclerosis progression, using a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mouse model. SMCs in proximity to atherosclerotic lesions express increased levels of the glucose transporter GLUT1. Cytokines, such as TNF-α produced by lesioned arteries, promote GLUT1 expression in SMCs, which in turn increases expression of the chemokine CCL2 through increased glycolysis and the polyol pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of GLUT1 in SMCs, but not in myeloid cells, accelerates development of larger, more advanced lesions in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome, which also exhibits elevated levels of circulating Ly6Chi monocytes expressing the CCL2 receptor CCR2. Accordingly, monocyte tracing experiments demonstrate that targeted SMC GLUT1 overexpression promotes Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment to lesions. Strikingly, SMC-targeted GLUT1 overexpression fails to accelerate atherosclerosis in mice that do not exhibit the metabolic syndrome phenotype or monocytosis. These reveal a potentially novel mechanism whereby arterial smooth muscle glucose metabolism synergizes with metabolic syndrome to accelerate monocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis progression.",2018,2018-06-07,15,Jci Insight,"animals; arteries; atherosclerosis; dicarbethoxydihydrocollidine; disease models, animal; disease progression; female; glucose; glucose transporter type 1; glycolysis; humans; male; metabolic syndrome; mice; mice, knockout; monocytes; muscle, smooth, vascular; myocytes, smooth muscle; receptors, ldl",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3208 Medical Physiology,"Wall, V.Z.

"Bouzouita, R.; Craioveanu, M.; Young, A.",Systemic risk in the insurance industry and its impact on the economy,"Systemic risk, defined as the risk that a failure of a large financial institution could lead to counterparty failures and could trigger adverse effects for the real economy, has been a priority for both academicians and policy-makers. The literature focuses on the measures and definition of systemic risk and on its impact on the financial sector with little or no attention given to the relationship between systemic risk and the real economy. In this paper, we investigate the link between the systemic risk in the insurance sector and the macro economy during the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, we test the predictive power of insurance companies’ systemic risk of macroeconomic downturns using various measures of systemic risk constructed from daily returns for 169 insurance companies between 1988 and 2011. Our findings show that insurance systemic risk forecasts macroeconomic downturns three months into the future.",2018,2018-06-30,0,Journal of Finance Issues,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Bouzouita, R.

However, the financial markets are becoming more and more complicate, which makes the usual study of systemic risk to be restricted. In this paper, we will study the systemic risk measures on a special space $L p( cdot)where the variable exponent $p( cdot)$ is no longer a given real number like the space $L$, but a random variable, which reflects the possible volatility of the financial markets. Finally, the dual representation for this new systemic risk measures will be studied.

In addition, comparisons of ranibizumab 0.3 mg with sham and ranibizumab 0.5 mg to 0.3 mg were performed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents carry potential increased systemic risks, including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. Pooled safety analyses allow better interpretation of safety outcomes seen in individual clinical trials, especially for less common events. To our knowledge, this is the largest patient-level pooled analysis of patients with nAMD treated with ranibizumab. METHODS: Patient-level pooled analysis of data fromGenentech- and Novartis-sponsored phase II, III, and IV studies in nAMD that were completed by December 31, 2013. Pairwise comparisons (primary comparison: ranibizumab 0.5 mg globally approved dose for nAMD vs. sham or verteporfin) were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression (hazard ratios HRs95% confidence intervals CIsand rates per 100 patient-years. Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries (SMQs) and extended searches were used to identify relevant safety endpoints, including arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke (excluding TIA), vascular deaths, and major vascular events as defined by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC).The HRs (95% CIs) for the primary comparison of ranibizumab 0.5 mg (n 480) versus sham or verteporfin (n 462) were 1.16 (0.72-1.88) for ATE, 1.33 (0.59-2.97) for MI, 1.43 (0.54-3.77) for stroke excluding TIA, 1.25 (0.61-2.55) for stroke or TIA, 0.57 (0.18-1.78) for vascular death, and 1.12 (0.64-1.98) for APTC events. Hazard ratio 95% CIs included 1, indicating no significant treatment differences, for all endpoints for comparison of ranibizumab 0.5 mg versus sham or verteporfin.The rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were low in these patients with nAMD and not clinically meaningfully different for patients treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg versus sham or verteporfin, which supports the favorable benefit-risk profile of ranibizumab in the patient population with nAMD.

"Ram, R.",Tectonic corneal lamellar grafting for surgically-induced necrotizing scleritis after strabismus surgery: case report literature review,"PURPOSE: To report the first case of infectious surgically-induced necrotizing scleritis following strabismus surgery which was treated successfully with a tectonic corneal graft. OBSERVATIONS: We report a case of surgically-induced necrotizing scleritis after strabismus surgery in a 61-year-old gentleman with gout and a subconjunctival abscess. Surgical drainage of the subconjunctival abscess led to a diagnosis of scleral melt which was subsequently treated with a tectonic corneal graft along with aggressive medical management. Over the following eight months, the patient showed no signs of endophthalmitis, graft necrosis, nor graft dehiscence, and serial anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated anatomic stability. AND IMPORTANCE: This case offers further insights into a rare but vision-threatening and potentially life-threatening diagnosis. In conjunction with aggressive local and systemic treatment, tectonic lamellar keratoplasty provides good therapeutic and tectonic for scleral necrosis after strabismus surgery. This case also demonstrates the importance of screening for associated systemic risk factors in any patient with scleritis for appropriate, targeted therapy.",2018,2018-05-01,8,American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,"Ram, R.

"Jokivuolle, E.; Tunaru, R.; Vioto, D.",Testing the systemic risk differences in banks,"This paper contains a testing framework for the reliability of systemic risk measurement of banks, using the three leading market-based measures of systemic risk. We test whether the difference within the same category and across dfferent categories of systemic risk of individual banks is signifcant. We find that in general the systemic risk categories defined by the Financial Stability Board are dfferent from those constructed in a full pairwise comparison approach based on the market measures. Moreover, these dfferences were more pronounced during episodes of high market turbulence.To account for model risk we introduce a more robust ranking method based on nonparametric confidence intervals. We show that there is a large number of banks with overlapping confidence intervals of their market-based systemic risk measures.Further, similarity measures indicate that the scoring based rankings are not perfectly aligned with rankings produced by market based systemic risk measures.",2018,2018-01-01,3,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Jokivuolle, E.

The demographics, type and duration of diabetes mellitus, treatment modality, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, as well as the systemic blood pressure, renal functional tests, hemoglobulin A1c level, serum lipid profile, and 24-h urine albumin level were noted and statistically analyzed. The relationships between the systemic findings and DME were studied.Four-hundred and thirteen eyes of 413 diabetic patients who were examined between January 2011 and July 2012 were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of DME was 15.3% among the patients. The males exhibited DME significantly more frequently than the females (p 0.031), and the duration of diabetes was significantly longer in those patients with DME (p 0.001). Those patients without DME frequently used antihyperlipidemic drugs and had a higher level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (p 0.040 and0.046, respectively). The patient’s alcohol consumption, nephropathy, neuropathy, previous cataract surgery, severity of diabetic retinopathy, and insulin usage were statistically significant factors with regard to the DME prevalence.This study demonstrated the prevalence of DME in Turkey by utilizing OCT.

"Parker, E.",The relationship between the US economy’s information processing and absorption ratios: systematic vs systemic risk,"After the 2008 financial collapse, the now popular measure of implied systemic risk called the absorption ratio was introduced. This statistic measures how closely the economy's markets are coupled. The more closely financial markets are coupled the more susceptible they are to systemic collapse. A new alternative measure of financial market health, the implied information processing ratio or entropic efficiency of the economy, was derived using concepts from information theory. This new entropic measure can also be useful in predicting economic downturns and measuring systematic risk. In the current work, the relationship between these two ratios and types of risks are explored. Potential methods of the joint use of these different measures to optimally reduce systemic and systematic risk are introduced.",2018,2018-09-02,4,Entropy,,49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Parker, E.

"Hurd, T.R.; Gleeson, J.P.; Melnik, S.",A framework for analyzing contagion in assortative banking networks,"We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking networks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous work on random financial networks assumes independent connections between banks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge probabilities (i.e., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge probabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition, analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 in epidemic modelling, that characterizes whether or not a single initially defaulted bank can trigger a cascade that extends to a finite fraction of the infinite network. This cascade condition is an easily computed measure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology. We use percolation theory for random networks to derive a formula for the frequency of global cascades. These analytical are shown to provide limited quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo simulation studies of finite-sized networks. We show that edge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade condition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and we propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the graph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.",2017,2017-02-23,14,Plos One,"algorithms; banking, personal; computer simulation; humans; models, economic; risk","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 51 Physical Sciences","Hurd, T.R.

"Moosavi, V.; Isacchini, G.",A markovian model of evolving world input-output network,"The initial theoretical connections between Leontief input-output models and Markov chains were established back in 1950s. However, considering the wide variety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, so far there has not been a full investigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism. In this work, using the recently available world input-output database, we investigated the evolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a time series of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving system via different known properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time, Kemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the transition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and Kemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we focused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of the economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional index of economies welfare. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk, called systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio of number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock in the activity of a node, and the latter is based on the number of times a specific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the other nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of monetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect of a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the world economic network. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high structural power to a slower average monetary flow over the network, there are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the network in terms of connectivity and the average flow of the money.",2017,2017-10-24,14,Plos One,"economics; internationality; markov chains; models, theoretical",38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics,"Moosavi, V.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 158 type-2 diabetic patients were divided into three groups based on their DR status. RNFL thickness and other optic disc parameters were obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and then compared among different groups. We investigated the potential association between RNFL loss and systemic risk factors for DR, including diabetes duration, body mass index (BMI), serum lipids, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). One-way ANOVA was carried out to compare RNFL thickness among different groups, Pearson correlation and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed to determine potential risk factors related to RNFL thickness in these patients.There were significant differences in the average (F 8.872,0.003), superior (F 8.769,0.004), and inferior (F 8.857,0.003) RNFL thickness of both eyes among the groups, but no obvious difference in optic disc parameters was found. Diabetic duration, BMI, TG, High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), HbA1c, and ACR were found negatively related to the RNFL thickness in both or single eye according to Pearson correlation analysis. After controlling for age, gender, and axis length (AL) in multivariate linear regression analysis, the diabetic duration was associated significantly with RNFL thickness of superior in both eye (right eye:0.016, left eye:0.024), BMI was related to the nasal quadrant of the right eye (p 0.034), and TG was related to the inferior of the right eye (p 0.037), HbA1c (p 0.026) was associated significantly with the average RNFL thickness of the right eye. In addition, ACR was found negatively related to average (p 0.042) and inferior quadrant (p 0.014) of the left eye, respectively.RNFL loss might be the earliest structural change of retina in diabetic patients, and associated with diabetic duration, BMI, TG, HbA1c, and ACR.

With international concern about the GBR’s declining ecological health, this paper identifies and focuses on implementation failure (primarily at catchment scale) as a systemic risk within the overall GBR governance system. There has been limited integrated analysis of the full suite of governance subdomains that often envelop defined policies, programs and delivery activities that influence water quality in the GBR. We consider how the implementation of separate purpose-specific policies and programs at catchment scale operate against well-known, robust design concepts for integrated catchment governance. We find design concerns within ten important governance subdomains that operate within GBR catchments. At a whole-of-GBR scale, we find a weak policy focus on strengthening these delivery-oriented subdomains and on effort integration across these subdomains within catchments. These governance problems when combined may contribute to failure in the implementation of major national, state and local government policies focused on improving water quality in the GBR, a lesson relevant to landscapes globally.",2017,2017-10-04,9,Environmental Management,agriculture; conservation of natural resources; coral reefs; decision making; environmental policy; forests; government regulation; queensland; rivers; water quality,41 Environmental Sciences; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,"Dale, A.P.

"Wittström, E.",Central retinal vein occlusion in younger swedish adults: case reports and review of the literature,"PURPOSE: To investigate associated systemic diseases, other conditions, visual outcome, ocular complications and treatment in Swedish patients younger than 50 years with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and reviewing the literature. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with CRVO, younger than 50 years, were examined with full-field electroretinography (ERG) withinmonths after a thrombotic event, or were periodically examined and were observed for at leastmonths. In 18 of these patients, the initial retinal ischemia was studied using the cone b-wave implicit time in the 30 Hz flicker ERG. Fifteen patients also underwent fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed in 14 patients. The patients studied were divided into two groups, non-ischemic and ischemic, which were compared. All patients underwent ocular and systemic examination, as well as complete screening for thrombophilic risk factors.Of the 22 patients, 15 had non-ischemic type of CRVO andthe ischemic type. Patients with non-ischemic CRVO showed significantly improved visual acuity (VA) at the final examination (p 0.006). Patients with ischemic CRVO showed no significant reduction in VA at the final examination (p 0.225). Systemic hypertension (27% in non-ischemic CRVO and 29% in ischemic CRVO) was the most prevalent systemic risk factor for CRVO. The mean central foveal thickness (CFT) decreased significantly from 402.3 136.2m) at the initial examination to 243.8 48.1m) at the final examination in the non-ischemic group (p 0.005). The mean initial CFT was 444.5 186.1m) in the ischemic CRVO group, which decreased to 211.5 20.2m) at the final visit (p 0.068). Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) pigmentary glaucoma (PG), ocular hypertension and dehydration were equally frequent four patients each (18%) out of 22. The clinical course ofyounger patients with PDS PG are described. CONCLUSION: The patients with non-ischemic CRVO showed significantly improved VA and significantly decreased CFT at the final examination. Systemic hypertension was the most prevalent risk factor for CRVO. Younger adults with CRVO also had a high prevalence of PDS PG, ocular hypertension and dehydration. This study highlights the importance of careful IOP monitoring, and the need to investigate possible PDS PG and to obtain an accurate history of the patient including alcohol intake and intense exercise.",2017,2017-05-22,9,the Open Ophthalmology Journal,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Wittström, E.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two POAG patients with an initial parafoveal scotoma (IPFS) within a 10 radius inhemifield and 42 POAG patients with an initial nasal step (INS) within the nasal periphery outside 10 of fixation inhemifield. METHODS: The peripapillary choroidal microvasculature was evaluated on en face images obtained using swept-source OCT angiography. Microvasculature dropout was defined as a focal sectoral capillary dropout with no visible microvascular network identified in the choroidal layer. Factors associated with IPFS, compared with INS, were assessed using logistic regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors associated with IPFS rather than INS.Microvasculature dropout was observed in 25 of 32 eyes (78.1%) in the IPFS group, but in onlyof 42 eyes (2.4%) in the INS group (P 0.001). In logistic regression analyses, only MvD was a significant factor influencing the presence of IPFS. Systemic risk factors such as cold extremities (P 0.026), migraine (P 0.044), lower mean arterial pressure (P 0.037), and lower ocular perfusion pressure (P 0.024) were associated significantly with the presence of MvD.The presence of MvD in the parapapillary choroid was a strong predictor for IPFS.",2017,2017-12-08,62,Ophthalmology,"adult; aged; blood pressure; choroid; choroid diseases; cross-sectional studies; female; fluorescein angiography; glaucoma, open-angle; humans; intraocular pressure; male; microvessels; middle aged; nerve fibers; optic disk; prospective studies; retinal ganglion cells; tomography, optical coherence; vision disorders; visual field tests; visual fields",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Lee, E.J.

"Srinivasan, K.; Ravikumar, S.; Chandra, S.R.; Ganapathy, S.; Ravi, G.S.",Cerebral and coronary vasculature in disease associations and dissociations in the south indian population,"Cerebrovascular accidents constitute the most common cause of disability all over the world. In India prevalence rate is 545 per 100000 and mortality rate is around 7.5 per thousand. Therefore the authors undertook a study on patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). They were investigated for clinical and or radiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) with the aim to decide on early neurological intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 210 patients who had undergone CABG were evaluated with neck vessel Doppler using high resolution duplex scanner system and computed tomography (CT) scan as well as MR angiogram (MRA) in addition to assessment of co morbid risk factors.91% of patients who had undergone CABG had radiological evidence of CVD. The most common risk associated with CAD and CVD was Hypertension (HT), DM, dyslipidemia and combined HT and DM in that order. Neck vessels were normal in 59%. Significant disease was found in only 7.2%. Internal carotids were abnormal in 82%. Infarcts were seen in 82.1%. DISCUSSION: This study reveals patients with CAD have a high degree of asymptomatic CVD. It is mostly due to small vessel disease including internal carotids but not so much with large vessels. Therefore, patients with CAD carry a high risk of vascular cognitive dysfunction. This can be reduced by effective management of the systemic risk factors. Screening for large vessel disease which is commonly done is likely to give a false sense of security. CONCLUSION: As against western population Indians seem to have small and medium sized vessels disease in the setting of CAD.",2017,2017-07-01,4,Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Srinivasan, K.

We first measure industry's conditional-value-at-risk (CoVaR) and the systemic risk contribution (ΔCoVaR) using the fitted time-varying t-copula function. The network of the stock industry is established based on dynamic conditional correlations with the minimum spanning tree. Then, we investigate the connection characteristics and topology of the network. Finally, we utilize seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SUR) of panel data to analyze the relationship between network topology of the stock industry and the industry's systemic risk contribution. The show that the systemic risk contribution of small-scale industries such as real estate, food and beverage, software services, and durable goods and clothing, is higher than that of large-scale industries, such as banking, insurance and energy. Industries with large betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficient and small node occupancy layer are associated with greater systemic risk contribution.

"Buch, C.M.; Krause, T.; Tonzer, L.",Drivers of systemic risk: do national and european perspectives differ,"In Europe, the financial stability mandate generally rests at the national level. But there is an important exception. Since the establishment of the Banking Union in 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) can impose stricter regulations than the national regulator. The precondition is that the ECB identifies systemic risks which are not adequately addressed by the macroprudential regulator at the national level. In this paper, we ask whether the drivers of systemic risk differ when applying a national versus a European perspective. We use market data for 80 listed euro-area banks to measure each bank's contribution to systemic risk (SRISK) at the national and the euro-area level. Our research delivers three main findings. First, on average, systemic risk increased during the financial crisis. The difference between systemic risk at the national and the euro-area level is not very large, but there is considerable heterogeneity across countries and banks. Second, an exploration of the drivers of systemic risk shows that a bank's contribution to systemic risk is positively related to its size and profitability. It decreases in a bank's share of loans to total assets. Third, the qualitative determinants of systemic risk are similar at the national and euro-area level, whereas the quantitative importance of some determinants differs.",2017,2017-01-01,2,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Buch, C.M.

Accumulating evidence links phagocytic signaling in the heart to cardiac development, adult myocardial homeostasis, and the resolution of cardiac inflammation of infectious, ischemic, and aging-associated etiology. Phagocytic clearance in the heart may be carried out by professional phagocytes, such as macrophages, and non-professional cells, including myofibrolasts and potentially epithelial cells. During cardiac development, phagocytosis initiates growth cues for early cardiac morphogenesis. In diseases of aging, including myocardial infarction, heightened levels of cell death require efficient phagocytic debridement to salvage further loss of terminally differentiated adult cardiomyocytes. Additional risk factors, including insulin resistance and other systemic risk factors, contribute to inefficient phagocytosis, altered phagocytic signaling, and delayed cardiac inflammation resolution. Under such conditions, inflammatory presentation of myocardial antigen may lead to autoimmunity and even possible rejection of transplanted heart allografts.

"Squartini, T.; Almog, A.; Caldarelli, G.; van, L.I.; Garlaschelli, D.; Cimini, G.",Enhanced capital-asset pricing model for the reconstruction of bipartite financial networks,"Reconstructing patterns of interconnections from partial information is one of the most important issues in the statistical physics of complex networks. A paramount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and amplification of financial distress in capital markets are strongly affected by the interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate balance sheets of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single positions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches to reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically dense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover, reconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of bilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing bipartite networks of security holdings (e.g., investment portfolios). Here we propose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization, tailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the traditional capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and allows us to reproduce the correct topology of the network. We test this enhanced CAPM (ECAPM) method on a dataset, collected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of European institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009-2015). Our approach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed maximum-entropy CAPM both in reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk due to fire sales spillovers. In general, ECAPM can be applied to the whole class of weighted bipartite networks described by the fitness model.",2017,2017-09-27,26,Physical Review E,,40 Engineering; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Squartini, T.

"Dethlefsen, C.; Pedersen, K.S.; Hojman, P.",Every exercise bout matters: linking systemic exercise responses to breast cancer control,"Cumulative epidemiological evidence shows that regular exercise lowers the risk of developing breast cancer and decreases the risk of disease recurrence. The causality underlying this relation has not been fully established, and the exercise recommendations for breast cancer patients follow the general physical activity guidelines, prescribing 150 min of exercise per week. Thus, elucidations of the causal mechanisms are important to prescribe and implement the most optimal training regimen in breast cancer prevention and treatment. The prevailing hypothesis on the positive association within exercise oncology has focused on lowering of the basal systemic levels of cancer risk factors with exercise training. However, another rather overlooked systemic exercise response is the marked acute increases in several potential anti-cancer components during each acute exercise bout. Here, we review the evidence of the exercise-mediated changes in systemic components with the ability to influence breast cancer progression. In the first part, we focus on systemic risk factors for breast cancer, i.e., sex hormones, insulin, and inflammatory markers, and their adaptation to long-term training. In the second part, we describe the systemic factors induced acutely during exercise, including catecholamines and myokines. In conclusion, we propose that the transient increases in exercise factors during acute exercise appear to be mediating the positive effect of regular exercise on breast cancer progression.",2017,2017-01-30,61,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,"adaptation, physiological; biomarkers; breast neoplasms; exercise; female; humans; immune system; risk factors; stress, physiological",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"Dethlefsen, C.

"Feinstein, Z.; Rudloff, B.; Weber, S.",Measures of systemic risk,"Systemic risk refers to the risk that the financial system is susceptible to failures due to the characteristics of the system itself. The tremendous cost of systemic risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the efficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current paper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk. Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures from the structure of the underlying system and theof a financial regulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms of capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two ingredients: A cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations of the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome and an acceptability criterion, i.e., a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a regulatory authority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of additional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual framework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm for their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case studies. Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal amount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after aggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail out. In contrast, our approach emphasizes operational systemic risk measures that include both ex-post-bailout costs as well as ex-ante-capital requirements and may be used to prevent systemic crises.",2017,2017-01-01,98,Siam Journal on Financial Mathematics,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment","Feinstein, Z.

In general, increasing age, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disorder, and cerebral stroke are systemic risk factors of RVO. However, RVO often occur in the unilateral eye and sometimes develop in young subjects who have no arteriosclerosis. In addition, RVO show different variations on the degrees of severity some RVO are resolved without any treatment and others develop vision-threatening complications such as macular edema, combined retinal artery occlusion, vitreous hemorrhage, and glaucoma. Clinical conditions leading to RVO are still open to question. In this review, we discuss how to treat RVO in practice by presenting some RVO cases.

"Squartini, T.; Cimini, G.; Gabrielli, A.; Garlaschelli, D.",Network reconstruction via density sampling,"Reconstructing weighted networks from partial information is necessary in many important circumstances, e.g. for a correct estimation of systemic risk. It has been shown that, in order to achieve an accurate reconstruction, it is crucial to reliably replicate the empirical degree sequence, which is however unknown in many realistic situations. More recently, it has been found that the knowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the strength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the total number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational requirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure valid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that, apart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network is homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling subsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of sampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased towards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our core technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the unknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data sets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect to the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever the available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes.",2017,2017-01-28,20,Applied Network Science,,"46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4607 Graphics, Augmented Reality and Games","Squartini, T.

Nevertheless, it is only able to capture a limited view of macula and does not show leakage. S: To evaluate the retinal microvasculature using OCT-A in patients with typediabetes as well as the association of OCT-A characteristics with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and systemic risk factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, observational study was conducted from Januaryto June 30, 2016, at medical retina clinics at the Singapore National Eye Center among 50 patients with typediabetes with and without DR (n 100 eyes). We examined the retinal microvasculature with swept-source OCT-A and a semiautomated software to measure the capillary density index (CDI) and fractal dimension (FD) at the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep retinal vascular plexus (DVP). We collected data on histories of patients' glycated hemoglobin A1c, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and renal impairment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CDI and FD at the SVP and DVP for each severity level of DR and the association of systemic risk factors vs the CDI and FD.The mean (SD) glycated hemoglobin A1c of the 50 patients (26 men and 24 women 35 Chinese mean SD age, 59.5 8.9 years) was 7.9% (1.7%). The mean (SD) CDI at the SVP decreased from 0.358 (0.017) in patients with no DR to 0.338 (0.012) in patients with proliferative DR (P .001) and at the DVP decreased in patients with no DR from 0.361 (0.019) to 0.345 (0.020) in patients with proliferative DR (P .04). The mean (SD) FD at the SVP increased from 1.53 (0.05) in patients with no DR to 1.60 (0.05) in patients with proliferative DR (P .01) and at the DVP increased from 1.55 (0.06) in patients with no DR to 1.61 (0.05) in patients with proliferative DR (P .02). For systemic risk factors, hyperlipidemia (odds ratio OR9.82 95% CI, 6.92-11.23 .001), smoking (OR, 10.90 95% CI, 8.23-12.34 .001), and renal impairment (OR, 3.72 95% CI, 1.80-4.81 .05) were associated with reduced CDI, while increased glycated hemoglobin A1c8%) (OR, 8.77 95% CI, 5.23-10.81 .01) and renal impairment (OR, 10.30 95% CI, 8.21-11.91 .001) were associated with increased FD. AND RELEVANCE: Optical coherence tomographic angiography is a novel imaging modality to quantify the retinal capillary microvasculature in patients with diabetes. It can be potentially used in interventional trials to study the effect of systemic risk factors on the microvasculature that was previously not accessible in a noninvasive manner.

PDR and maculopathy prevalence wereand 0.7% for 10 years T1DM duration. PDR prevalence was 4%, 8%, and 16% for 10 19.9 years, 20 29.9, years and 30 years duration, respectively. Maculopathy prevalence was 15.6%, 18%, and 11% for 10 19.9 years, 20 29.9 years, and 30 years duration, respectively. In univariate analysis, PDR was associated with T1DM duration (odds ratio (OR) 1.07 year), age (OR 1.03 year), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.03 mmHg), and antihypertensive therapy (OR 10.63), while maculopathy was associated with duration (OR 1.03 year) and statin therapy (OR 2.83). In multivariate analysis, disease duration (OR 1.07 year) and antihypertensive therapy (OR 6.87) remained significantly associated with PDR, and maculopathy with statin therapy (OR 2.27).ConclusionThis study confirms T1DM duration is a strong risk factor for sight-threatening DR.

A 9-member team was assembled, comprising of a leader and process experts who prospectively assessed the medicine dispensing process by brainstorming, quantified the attributed risks, proposed corrective actions, and reassessed the risks.The analysis identified 39 failure modes, out of which the highest criticality scores were assigned to inadequate assessment of therapy appropriateness (Risk Priority Number 45), reluctance to deviate from rebate contracts (36), and dispensing the wrong medicine (30). The corrective actions proposed demonstrated a considerable potential for risk reduction in most failure modes, the most effective of which were introducing obligatory continuous education for pharmacists, organizing communication training, and implementing electronic prescribing.

"Bilodeau, E.A.; Guggenheimer, J.",Relevance of smoking interventions for dental clinic patients with smoking related disease,"Despite a decline in cigarette smoking in the United States, high rates persist among the socioeconomically underserved who consequently are at risk for smoking-related disease (SRD). Since academically affiliated dental clinics are more likely to encounter underserved patients, smoking interventions could address both the oral and systemic risks of continued smoking. To determine the relevance of providing smoking counseling in the context of SRD, this study examined the prevalence of smoking and its associations with socioeconomic status (SES), SRD and its sequela, and medication use. METHODS: Socioeconomic and smoking status was determined from 1,797 electronic health records of a sample of patients at a Pennsylvania dental clinic in 2010. Low SES included patients who were covered by a Medicaid program (MA) or ""self-payers."" High SES encompassed those with an employment-based commercial dental insurance (COM). Self-reported smoking rates were compared with patients' SES, SRDs or sequela, and medications being used for the management of their SRDs.Overall, 41.7 percent of these patients were smoking. Smoking was related to SES with the highest rate (52.7 percent) among MA patients compared with 31.5 percent in patients with COM. In addition, 37 percent of patients with SRD or sequela and 33 percent who were taking medications for their management were smoking.Academically affiliated dental clinics are more likely to encounter underserved patients who smoke and have SRD.

"Chan, T.C.W.; Bala, C.; Siu, A.; Wan, F.; White, A.",Risk factors for rapid glaucoma disease progression,"PURPOSE: To determine the intraocular and systemic risk factor differences between a cohort of rapid glaucoma disease progressors and nonrapid disease progressors. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. METHODS: Setting: Five private ophthalmology clinics. STUDY POPULATION: Forty-eight rapidly progressing eyes (progression dB mean deviation MD year) and 486 non-rapidly progressing eyes (progression dB MD year). Patients were eligible if they had a diagnosis of glaucoma from their ophthalmologist and if they had greater than or equal toHumphrey visual fields (24-2) conducted. Patients were excluded if their sequential visual fields showed an improvement in MD or if they had greater thandB MD variation in between visits. Patients with obvious neurologic fields were excluded. OBSERVATION PROCEDURE: Clinical and demographic data (age, sex, central corneal thickness CCTintraocular pressure IOPrefraction, medications), as well as medical, surgical, and ocular histories, were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk factor differences between the cohorts were measured using the independenttest, Wald χ2, and binomial regression analysis.Rapid progressors were older, had significantly lower CCT and baseline IOPs, and were more likely to have pseudoexfoliation, disc haemorrhages, ocular medication changes, and IOP-lowering surgery. They also had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease and hypotension. Subjects with cardiovascular disease were 2.33 times more likely to develop rapidly progressive glaucoma disease despite significantly lower mean and baseline IOPs.

Therefore, DES design, materials, and coatings have been technologically revolutionized. Herein, we designed a novel abluminal groove-filled biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (AGF-BP-SES), with a sirolimus content of only about one-third of traditional DES. The mechanical performances of AGF-BP-SES during compression and expansion were investigated. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sirolimus was studied in the swine model. The in vivo efficacy of AGF-BP-SES was compared with that of Xience PRIME stent. The showed that AGF-BP-SES exhibited mechanical properties similar to traditional DES, including the rebound ratio of radial contraction direction, rebound ratio of axial contraction direction, and inhomogeneity of compression expansion. Despite utilizing a reduced dose of sirolimus, AGF-BP-SES delivered sirolimus to the coronary artery in a controlled and efficient manner. The stent maintained a safe and effective local drug concentration without local or systemic risks. In the swine model, histopathological indicators predicted safety and biocompatibility of AGF-BP-SES. In conclusion, AGF-BP-SES maintained similar mechanical properties as other stents while reducing the drug-loading capacity, and showed a favorable safety and efficacy profile of the targeted DES.Graphical Abstract",2017,2017-02-14,4,Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine,"absorbable implants; animals; area under curve; biocompatible materials; coronary artery disease; coronary vessels; drug delivery systems; drug-eluting stents; finite element analysis; humans; microscopy, electron, scanning; patient safety; polymers; sirolimus; stents; swine; thrombosis",40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering,"Zhu, J.

Measuring the systemic risk of an individual hedge fund by using the marginal expected shortfall (MES), we find evidence for a positive and statistically significant relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns. The risk-adjusted return of a hedge fund portfolio with a high systemic risk is 0.64% per month higher than for one with a low systemic risk during 1994 2012, while negative performance is observed during crisis periods. The relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns holds for both live and defunct funds. Moreover, the relation holds even after controlling for a large set of fund characteristics. Hence, systemic risk is a powerful determinant of cross-sectional variations in hedge fund returns.

The hierarchy increased in all minor crises in the observation time window except for the sharp crisis of 2007-2008 when the global financial crisis occurred. The sudden increase in hierarchy just before the global financial crisis can be used for the early detection of an upcoming crisis. Clearly, the higher the hierarchy, the higher the threats to financial stability. The scaling relations were developed to observe the changes in hierarchy with the network topology.

"Nakamura, M.; Abrouk, M.; Zhu, H.; Farahnik, B.; Koo, J.; Bhutani, T.",Update on the systemic risks of superpotent topical steroids,"The potential for systemic effects due to percutaneous absorption of superpotent topical steroids has been a longstanding concern. The Food and Drug Administration currently recommends limiting the use of superpotent topical steroids to 50g per week fororconsecutive weeks depending on the formulation, which is mostly based on the exact duration with which phaseclinical trials were allowed to be conducted per the FDA. This article reviews all published clinical incidence of adrenal adverse effects in the medical literature, specifically Cushing's syndrome (CS) and pathologic adrenal suppression (PAAS), to try to ascertain a more realistic limit for the safe use of superpotent topical steroids as it pertains to its potential systemic effects. METHODS: Literature search was conducted using PubMed. Only cases of CS and PAAS secondary to the use of Classsuperpotent topical steroids were included. Pediatric cases and full articles unavailable in English were excluded.There were a total of 14 cases of CS andcases of subsequent PAAS found in the current literature. DISCUSSION: From our review of these cases, if the amount used per week is within FDA guidelines, it appears that patients needed to use superpotent topical steroids for far greater thanorweeks to develop CS or PAAS. CS did not necessarily predict occurrence of PAAS, but in all cases CS appeared to be a prerequisite for developing PAAS. All cases of CS and all but one case of PAAS were reversible. If excessive amount of greater than 50g per week is avoided, it appears that superpotent topical steroids may be safe to use consecutively for months, perhaps even years, without causing systemic effects.Drugs Dermatol. 2017 16(7):643-648..",2017,2017-07-01,4,Journal of Drugs in Dermatology,"administration, topical; adrenal gland diseases; adult; aged; cushing syndrome; eczema; female; humans; male; middle aged; psoriasis; risk factors; steroids",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Nakamura, M.

Better tools to identify indolent tumors are needed to avoid overtreatment.To determine if a multigene classifier is associated with indolent behavior of invasive breast cancers in women followed fordecades. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen vs no systemic therapy, with more than 20-year follow-up. An indolent threshold (ultralow risk) of the US Food and Drug Administration-cleared MammaPrint 70-gene expression score was established above which no breast cancer deaths occurred after 15 years in the absence of systemic therapy. Immunohistochemical markers (n 727 women) and Agilent microarrays, for MammaPrint risk scoring (n 652 women), were performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor blocks. Participants were postmenopausal women with clinically detected node-negative breast cancers treated with mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation enrolled in the Stockholm tamoxifen (STO-3) trial, 1976 to 1990. EXPOSURES: Afteryears of tamoxifen vs no systemic therapy, regardless of hormone receptor status, patients without relapse who reconsented were further randomized toadditional years or none. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Breast cancer-specific survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling, adjusted for treatment, patient age, year of diagnosis, tumor size, grade, hormone receptors, and ERBB2 HER2 and Ki67 status.In this secondary analysis of node-negative postmenopausal women, conducted in the era before mammography screening, among the 652 women with MammaPrint scoring available (median age, 62.8 years of age), 377 (58%) and 275 (42%) were MammaPrint low and high risk, respectively, while 98 (15%) were ultralow risk. At 20 years, women with 70-gene high and low tumors but not ultralow tumors had a significantly higher risk of disease-specific death compared with ultralow-risk patients by Cox analysis (hazard ratios, 4.73 95% CI, 1.38-16.22 and 4.54 95% CI, 1.40-14.80respectively). There were no deaths in the ultralow-risk tamoxifen-treated arm at 15 years, and these patients had a 20-year disease-specific survival rate of 97%, whereas for untreated patients the survival rate was 94%. Recursive partitioning identified ultralow risk as the most significant predictor of good outcome. In tumors ""not ultralow risk,"" tumor size greater thancm was the most predictive of outcome.

Relevant articles were selected and analysed.Patients with diabetic retinopathy were more likely to have poor glycaemic control as reflected by a higher glycated haemoglobin, longer duration of diabetes, and use of insulin therapy for treatment. For other systemic risk factors, hypertension was positively associated with prevalence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. No clear association between obesity, hyperlipidaemia, gender, or smoking with diabetic retinopathy has been established as studies reported inconsistent findings. Myopia was a protective factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy.

From the study of arterial bifurcation regions, emerges ample evidence that haemodynamics are involved in the local onset and progression of the atherosclerotic disease. This observed co-localisation of disturbed flow regions and lesion prevalence at geometrically predisposed districts such as arterial bifurcations has led to the formulation of a 'haemodynamic hypothesis', that in this review is grounded to the most current research concerning localising factors of vascular disease. In particular, this review focuses on carotid and coronary bifurcations because of their primary relevance to stroke and heart attack. We highlight reported relationships between atherosclerotic plaque location, progression and composition, and fluid forces at vessel's wall, in particular shear stress and its 'easier-to-measure' surrogates, i.e. vascular geometric attributes (because geometry shapes the flow) and intravascular flow features (because they mediate disturbed shear stress), in order to give more insight in plaque initiation and destabilisation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of premature infants who were treated with bedside transpupillary diode laser photocoagulation under remifentanil analgesia for ROP were evaluated for clinical and demographic characteristics, accompanying systemic risk factors, laser parameters, complications of treatment, retreatment rate and one-year structural outcomes.One-hundred and ninety-five eyes of 99 infants (59 males, 40 females) were recruited for the study. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 27.4 2.3 weeks (23-34) and 1003.3 297.8(570-2250), respectively. Laser therapy was performed for high-risk prethreshold ROP in 66.2% of eyes, aggressive posterior ROP (APROP) in 15.4% and threshold ROP in 18.4%. The mean number of laser spots was 1510.4 842.1 per laser session. No adverse effects of laser photocoagulation were observed except small lens opacities in two eyes and corneal opacity in one eye. Retreatment was needed in only three eyes, and vitreoretinal surgery was needed in six eyes of six patients despite laser treatment. Anatomic outcome was favorable in 189 eyes (96.9%) at the end of a 1-year follow-up.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of eyes that developed recurrent CRVO was performed. Key exclusion criteria were follow-up of less than six months after the recurrence, incomplete documentation, and recurrent macular edema in an eye with a CRVO but without evidence of increased superficial hemorrhage or disc edema (recurrent CRVO). Collected data included demographic information, history of presenting illness including the previous CRVO, ocular and systemic co-morbidities, and clinical examination findings that included visual acuities and imaging details from the time of initial CRVO diagnosis until the final examination.Thirteen eyes of 12 subjects with recurrent CRVO were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 63 years (range: 42 to 79 years). The mean interval between treatment of the initial CRVO and the onset of the recurrent CRVO was 9.0 9.3 months. The visual acuity declined by approximately eight lines at the time of recurrence. Treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors and corticosteroids significantly improved mean central macular thickness (CMT) from the time of recurrence until the final examination (808 169 vs. 511 302 P 0.004), but failed to change visual acuity (1.28 0.31 logMAR vs. 1.24 0.43 logMAR 0.8).

The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of implant failure and complications between obese and nonobese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts from 220 partially edentulous patients with 321 implants were examined for demographic information, medical health history, diabetes, smoking, patient-reported height and weight, periodontal status (no, mild, moderate, or severe periodontitis), tooth number, date of the implant and prosthesis placement, and treatment notes pertinent to the complications or failure. Subjects were classified according to their body mass index (BMI) as normal (18.5 to 24.5 kg m(2)), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg m(2)), or obese30 kg m(2)) based on self-reported height and weight. Variables including sex, smoking, diabetes, and periodontal condition were considered as confounders. Data were analyzed to examine differences in frequency of complications and occurrence of failures.Implant failure was low (2.1%) and did not differ by BMI category. Compared with normal BMI patients, obese patients had increased odds of experiencing an implant complication (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.4, 17.6after adjustment for other variables. Diabetes was not associated with an increased risk of complications obese patients with diabetes had decreased odds of an implant complication compared with obese patients without diabetes. CONCLUSION: No association was observed between obesity and implant failures.

Local and systemic risk factors can result in higher failure rates. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that goes in with hyperglycemia and causes multifarious side effects. Diabetes as a relative contraindication for implant surgery is controversially discussed. Because the number of patients suffering from diabetes increases, there are more diabetic patients demanding implant procedures. We aimed to answer the PICO question Do diabetic patients with dental implants have a higher complication rate in comparison to healthy controls by a systematic literature search based on the PRISMA statement. We identified 22 clinical studies and 20 publications of aggregated literature, which were quite heterogeneous concerning methods andWe conclude that patients with poorly controlled diabetes suffer from impaired osseointegration, elevated risk of peri-implantitis, and higher level of implant failure. The influence of duration of the disease is not fully clear. The supportive administration of antibiotics and chlorhexidine seems to improve implant success.

However, systemic metabolism and biosafety of MBG nanospheres which are crucial issues for clinical application are yet to be fully understood. Isotope quantitative tracing combined with biochemical parameters and histopatological changes were used to analyze biodistribution, excretion path and the effect on metabolism and major organs, and then we focused on the hepatocellular location and damaging effect of MBG. The indicated MBG possessed a longer residence time in blood. After being cleared from circulation, nanospheres were mainly distributed in the liver and were slightly internalized in the form of exogenous phagosome by hepatocyte, whereby more than 96% of nanospheres were located in the cytoplasm (nearly no nuclear involvement). A little MBG was transferred into the mitochondria, but did not cause ROS reaction. Furthermore, no abnormal metabolism and histopathological changes was observed. The accumulation of MBG nanospheres in various organs were excreted mainly through feces.

However, systemic risk taxation also may inform banks about the regulatorconcern for financial stability and thereby its bailout policy.

"Cimini, G.; Serri, M.",Entangling credit and funding shocks in interbank markets,"Credit and liquidity shocks represent main channels of financial contagion for interbank lending markets. On one hand, banks face potential losses whenever their counterparties are under distress and thus unable to fulfill their obligations. On the other hand, solvency constraints may force banks to recover lost fundings by selling their illiquid assets, resulting in effective losses in the presence of fire sales-that is, when funding shortcomings are widespread over the market. Because of the complex structure of the network of interbank exposures, these losses reverberate among banks and eventually get amplified, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole financial system. Inspired by the recently proposed Debt Rank, in this work we define a systemic risk metric that estimates the potential amplification of losses in interbank markets accounting for both credit and liquidity contagion channels: the Debt-Solvency Rank. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183 European banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013, showing indeed that liquidity spillovers substantially increase systemic risk, and thus cannot be neglected in stress-test scenarios. We also provide additional evidence that the interbank market was extremely fragile up to the global financial crisis, becoming slightly more robust only afterwards.",2016,2016-08-25,28,Plos One,"commerce; financial management; financial support; models, economic; probability; risk; solvents","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Cimini, G.

There is evidence that the prevalence of glaucoma is higher in OSA patients, which independent of intraocular pressure (IOP). Studies have reported thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), alteration of optic nerve head, choroidal and macular thickness, and reduced VF sensitivity in patients of OSA with no history glaucoma. A negative correlation of apnea-hypopnea index with RNFL and VF indices has been described in some studies. Raised IOP was noted which is possibly related to obesity, supine position during sleep, and raised intracranial pressure. Diurnal fluctuations of IOP show more variations in OSA patients before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy when compared with the normal cases. The vascular factors behind the pathogenesis include recurrent hypoxia with increased vascular resistance, oxidative stress damage to the optic nerve. In conclusion, comprehensive glaucoma evaluation should be recommended in patients with OSA and should also periodically monitor IOP during CPAP treatment which may trigger the progression of glaucomatous damage.",2016,2016-01-01,35,Oman Journal of Ophthalmology,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Chaitanya, A.

"Burkholz, R.; Garas, A.; Schweitzer, F.",How damage diversification can reduce systemic risk,"We study the influence of risk diversification on cascading failures in weighted complex networks, where weighted directed links represent exposures between nodes. These weights result from different diversification strategies and their adjustment allows us to reduce systemic risk significantly by topological means. As an example, we contrast a classical exposure diversification (ED) approach with a damage diversification (DD) variant. The latter reduces the loss that the failure of high degree nodes generally inflict to their network neighbors and thus hampers the cascade amplification. To quantify the final cascade size and obtain ourwe develop a branching process approximation taking into account that inflicted losses cannot only depend on properties of the exposed, but also of the failing node. This analytic extension is a natural consequence of the paradigm shift from individual to system safety. To deepen our understanding of the cascade process, we complement this systemic perspective by a mesoscopic one: an analysis of the failure risk of nodes dependent on their degree. Additionally, we ask for the role of these failures in the cascade amplification.",2016,2016-04-22,20,Physical Review E,,51 Physical Sciences,"Burkholz, R.

"Bandivadekar, P.; Gupta, S.; Sharma, N.",Intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage after penetrating keratoplasty,"To describe four cases of intraoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) during penetrating keratoplasty and to review the literature. METHODS: Cases with intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty over 3-year period were reviewed. The parameters evaluated were ocular and systemic risk factors, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes. A review of literature of intraoperative SCH during penetrating keratoplasty was also conducted.Of the 543 cases that underwent penetrating keratoplasty for optical indications during the study period, four cases developed intraoperative SCH, which is an incidence of 0.73%. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurred in the following cases: failed pediatric graft, donor eye in a case of contralateral autokeratoplasty, Marfan syndrome with aphakic bullous keratopathy who had undergone multiple ocular surgeries, and a case of healed keratitis with corneoiridic scar. The mean age, axial length, and intraocular pressure were 32.75 22.17 years (range, 4-57 years), 23.29 2.12 mm (range, 20.38-25.2 mm), and 16.25 3.86 mm Hg (range, 16-20 mm Hg), respectively.

METHODS: This retrospective, institutional, case control study included 499 patients, wherein 262 patients diagnosed as acute CSCR, were compared with an age and gender matched control group of 237 patients. All patients were evaluated with a detailed systemic and ocular history, and subjective refractions for both eyes and complete ocular examination by a retina specialist, at all visits. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the diagnosis of CSCR.The mean age was found to be 40 7y in the study group (Group 1) compared to 38 10y in the control group (Group 2). Most common refractive status in the study group, was emmetropia seen in 191 patients (72.9%), followed by hypermetropia seen in 47 patients (17.9%) and astigmatism seen in 21 patients (8.0%). Onlysubjects (1.1%) had myopia, which was less than or equal to 1.0 D, compared to 70 subjects (29.5%) in the control group, suggesting a statistically significant lower incidence of CSCR among the myopic patients (P 0.0001). With respect to the systemic factors, 26 (9.9%) patients were using systemic steroids in the study group (Group 1) compared to none in the control group (Group 2) suggesting a statistically significant association of CSCR with systemic steroid use (P 0.05). No other significant systemic risk factors were noted. CONCLUSION: Though CSCR is a multifactorial disease, myopia serves as a protective factor for CSCR. Thus, myopic eyes are less likely to develop CSCR. Since both retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris are postulated in the pathogenesis of CSCR, chorio-retinal thinning and atrophy seen in myopic eyes are less likely to cause CSCR.",2016,2016-02-18,28,International Journal of Ophthalmology,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Manayath, G.J.

"Guttal, V.; Raghavendra, S.; Goel, N.; Hoarau, Q.","Lack of critical slowing down suggests that financial meltdowns are not critical transitions, yet rising variability could signal systemic risk","Complex systems inspired analysis suggests a hypothesis that financial meltdowns are abrupt critical transitions that occur when the system reaches a tipping point. Theoretical and empirical studies on climatic and ecological dynamical systems have shown that approach to tipping points is preceded by a generic phenomenon called critical slowing down, i.e. an increasingly slow response of the system to perturbations. Therefore, it has been suggested that critical slowing down may be used as an early warning signal of imminent critical transitions. Whether financial markets exhibit critical slowing down prior to meltdowns remains unclear. Here, our analysis reveals that three major US (Dow Jones Index,P 500 and NASDAQ) and two European markets (DAX and FTSE) did not exhibit critical slowing down prior to major financial crashes over the last century. However, all markets showed strong trends of rising variability, quantified by time series variance and spectral function at low frequencies, prior to crashes. These suggest that financial crashes are not critical transitions that occur in the vicinity of a tipping point. Using a simple model, we argue that financial crashes are likely to be stochastic transitions which can occur even when the system is far away from the tipping point. Specifically, we show that a gradually increasing strength of stochastic perturbations may have caused to abrupt transitions in the financial markets. Broadly, our highlight the importance of stochastically driven abrupt transitions in real world scenarios. Our study offers rising variability as a precursor of financial meltdowns albeit with a limitation that they may signal false alarms.",2016,2016-01-13,43,Plos One,financial management; germany; risk; stochastic processes; time factors; united kingdom,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics","Guttal, V.

We examined the relationship between epistemic cultures in citizen science projects and learning potential related to matters of concern. We then developed a typology of purposes and a citizen science epistemic-cultures heuristic and mapped 56 projects in southern Africa using this framework. The purpose typology represents the range of knowledge-production purposes, ranging from laboratory science to social learning, whereas the epistemic-cultures typology is a relational representation of scientist and citizen participation and their approach to knowledge production. showed an iterative relationship between matters of fact and matters of concern across the projects the nexus of citizens' engagement in knowledge-production activities varied. The knowledge-production purposes informed and shaped the epistemic cultures of all the sampled citizen science projects, which in turn influenced the potential for learning within each project. Through a historical review ofphases in a long-term river health-monitoring project, we found that it is possible to evolve the learning curve of citizen science projects. This evolution involved the development of scientific water monitoring tools, the parallel development of pedagogic practices supporting monitoring activities, and situated engagement around matters of concern within social activism leading to learning-led change.

Even though predictive risk classifications are a widely accepted tool to define a suitable treatment protocol a classification is still missing considering the difficulty in treating the -causative pathogen antibiotically. In this study, we present and evaluate a new predictive risk stratification for prosthetic joint infections in 120 cases, treated with a two-stage exchange. Treatment outcomes in 120 patients with proven prosthetic joint infections in hip and knee prostheses were regressed on time of infection, systemic risk factors, local risk factors and the difficulty in treating the causing pathogen. The main outcome variable was ""definitely free of infection"" after two years as published. Age, gender, and BMI were included as covariables and analyzed in a logistic regression model. 66 male and 54 female patients, with a mean age at surgery of 68.3 years 12.0 and a mean BMI of 26.05 6.21 were included in our survey and followed for 29.0 11.3 months. We found a significant association (p 0.001) between our score and the outcome parameters evaluated. Age, gender and BMI did not show a significant association with the outcome. These show that our score is an independent and reliable predictor for the cure rate in prosthetic joint infections in hip and knee prostheses treated within a two-stage exchange protocol. Our score illustrates, that there is a statistically significant, sizable decrease in cure rate with an increase in score. In patients with prosthetic joint infections the validation of a risk score may help to identify patients with local and systemic risk factors or with infectious organisms identified as ""difficult to treat"" prior to the treatment or the decision about the treatment concept. Thus, appropriate extra care should be considered and provided.",2016,2016-03-01,10,Acta Orthopaedica Belgica,"age factors; aged; aged, 80 and over; alcoholism; anti-bacterial agents; arthroplasty, replacement; arthroplasty, replacement, hip; arthroplasty, replacement, knee; body mass index; comorbidity; female; hepatic insufficiency; hip prosthesis; humans; immunosuppressive agents; joint prosthesis; kidney failure, chronic; knee prosthesis; logistic models; male; malnutrition; middle aged; odds ratio; postoperative complications; prognosis; prosthesis-related infections; renal dialysis; reoperation; respiratory insufficiency; risk assessment; risk factors; sex factors; time factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Wimmer, M.D. (); Randau, T.M.

Patients with diabetes often develop DR despite appropriate control of systemic risk factors, suggesting the involvement of other pathogenic factors. We hypothesize that the plasma metabolic signature of DR is distinct and resolvable from that of diabetes alone. A nested population-based case-control metabonomic study was first performed on 40 DR cases and 40 control subjects with diabetes using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Eleven metabolites were found to be correlated with DR, and the majority were robust when adjusted for metabolic risk factors and confounding kidney disease. The metabolite markers 2-deoxyribonic acid 3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid erythritol gluconic acid and ribose were validated in an independent sample set with 40 DR cases, 40 control subjects with diabetes, and 40 individuals without diabetes. DR cases and control subjects with diabetes were matched by HbA1c in the validation set. Activation of the pentose phosphate pathway was identified from the list of DR metabolite markers.

However, the systemic risk factors for this condition remain unclear. Therefore, patients with NPC who received radiotherapy between 2004 and 2007 at the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center were retrospectively reviewed in this case-control study. The study included 40 RION patients and 40 patients in the control group, who were strictly matched to the RION patients by tumor histopathology, location, Union for International Cancer Control-Tumor Node Metastasis classification and radiotherapy protocol. Univariate and multivariate statistical regression analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of RION. The univariate analysis demonstrated that age60 years), gender (female) and chemotherapy significantly affected the risk of RION, whereas diabetes, hypertension and hepatitisvirus infection did not exert a significant effect. The of the multivariate analysis suggested that only gender and chemotherapy were significantly associated with an increased incidence of RION. Therefore, the of the present study suggested that female gender and chemotherapy constitute risk factors for the development of RION following radiotherapy for NPC.

METHODS: This population-based study of 10,033 participants (75.7% response rate) included Chinese, Indian and Malay persons aged 40 years and older. A comprehensive ophthalmic examination, standardized interviews and laboratory blood tests were performed. Digital fundus photographs were assessed for presence of RVO following the definitions used in the Blue Mountains Eye Study. Regression analysis models were constructed to study the relationship between ocular and systemic factors and RVO. Age-specific prevalence rates of RVO were applied to project the number of people affected in Asia from 2013 to 2040.The overall crude prevalence of RVO was 0.72% (n 71 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.54-0.87%). The crude prevalence of RVO was similar in Chinese, Indian and Malay participants (p 0.865). In multivariable regression models, significant risk factors of RVO included increased age (odds ratio, OR, 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06), hypertension (OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.61-8.31), increased serum creatinine (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, per 10 mmolincrease), history of heart attack (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.11-4.54) and increased total cholesterol (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07-1.59, permmolincrease). None of the ocular parameters were associated with RVO. RVO is estimated to affect up to 16 and 21 million people in Asia by 2020 and 2040, respectively.

At a high level, financial systems may be represented as weighted graphs that characterize the complex web of interacting agents and information flow (for example, debt, stock returns, and shareholder ownership). Such a representation often turns out to provide keen insights. We show that fragility is a system-level characteristic of ""business-as-usual"" market behavior and that financial crashes are invariably preceded by system-level changes in robustness. This was done by leveraging previous work, which suggests that Ricci curvature, a key geometric feature of a given network, is negatively correlated to increases in network fragility. To illustrate this insight, we examine daily returns from a set of stocks comprising the Standard and Poor's 500 (S500) over a 15-year span to highlight the fact that corresponding changes in Ricci curvature constitute a financial ""crash hallmark.""

"Cassidy, A.; Feinstein, Z.; Nehorai, A.",Risk measures for power failures in transmission systems,"We present a novel framework for evaluating the risk of failures in power transmission systems. We use the concept of systemic risk measures from the financial mathematics literature with models of power system failures in order to quantify the risk of the entire power system for design and comparative purposes. The proposed risk measures provide the collection of capacity vectors for the components in the system that lead to acceptable outcomes. Keys to the formulation of our measures of risk are two elements: a model of system behavior that provides the (distribution of) outcomes based on component capacities and an acceptability criterion that determines whether a (random) outcome is acceptable from an aggregated point of view. We examine the effects of altering the line capacities on energy not served under a variety of networks, flow manipulation methods, load shedding schemes, and load profiles using Monte Carlo simulations. Our provide a quantitative comparison of the performance of these schemes, measured by the required line capacity.

Hence, it is clinically relevant to determine whether ESRD is a predictor of retinal artery occlusion (RAO).To investigate the risk of RAO in ESRD patients.A retrospective, nationwide, matched cohort study. The study included 93,766 ESRD patients recruited between 2000 and 2009 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The same number control group included age- and sex-matched patients without ESRD selected from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, 2000. Data for each patient were collected from the index date until December 2011.The incidence and risk of RAO were compared between thegroups. The hazard ratio (HR) for RAO after adjustment for potential confounders was calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative RAO incidence rate.In total, 237 ESRD patients and 73 controls exhibited RAO during follow-up thus, the RAO incidence rate in ESRD patients was 4.49 times (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.45-5.83) that in the control patients. After adjustment for potential confounders, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease, ESRD patients were 2.78 times (95% CI, 2.02-3.84) more likely to develop RAO in cohort for the total sample. Among patients with hypertension, the RAO incidence rate was significantly higher in the ESRD group, and hypertension significantly increased RAO risk even after adjustment for other confounders in the cohort.ESRD increases the risk of RAO, particularly in ESRD patients with hypertension.

We propose a method to assess the statistical significance of the overlap between heterogeneously diversified portfolios, which we use to build a validated network of financial institutions where links indicate potential contagion channels. The method is implemented on a historical database of institutional holdings ranging from 1999 to the end of 2013, but can be applied to any bipartite network. We find that the proportion of validated links (i.e. of significant overlaps) increased steadily before the 2007 2008 financial crisis and reached a maximum when the crisis occurred. We argue that the nature of this measure implies that systemic risk from fire sales liquidation was maximal at that time. After a sharp drop in 2008, systemic risk resumed its growth in 2009, with a notable acceleration in 2013. We finally show that market trends tend to be amplified in the portfolios identified by the algorithm, such that it is possible to have an informative signal about institutions that are about to suffer (enjoy) the most significant losses (gains).",2016,2016-12-21,90,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Gualdi, S.

Bilateral vitrectomy has been especially associated with a poor visual prognosis in patients with PDR. The authors investigated the systemic risk factors for PDR requiring bilateral vitrectomy compared with unilateral vitrectomy. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 86 consecutive patients with Typediabetes mellitus with PDR who underwent vitrectomy. These patients were divided intogroups: bilateral vitrectomy withinyear (n 25) and unilateral vitrectomy (n 61). The authors compared the systemic risk factors: age, sex, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, uric albumin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of ischemic heart disease, arteriosclerosis obliterans, and smoking.There were significantly more cases with severe renal dysfunction in the bilateral vitrectomy group compared with the unilateral one (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 mL minute 1.73bilateral cases 25 unilateral cases 61 0.02). CONCLUSION: The authors found that severe renal dysfunction may be a risk factor in PDR requiring bilateral vitrectomy, indicating that careful attention needs to be paid to prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy to severe PDR in the other eye if patients have severe unilateral PDR and severe renal dysfunction.",2016,2016-07-01,12,Retina,"aged; body mass index; diabetes mellitus, type 2; diabetic retinopathy; female; glomerular filtration rate; glycated hemoglobin a; humans; male; middle aged; renal insufficiency; retrospective studies; risk factors; vitrectomy",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Song, Y.

"Derbali, A.; Hallara, S.",Systemic risk of european financial institutions: estimation and ranking by the marginal expected shortfall,"The task of processing systemic events and its negative externalities requires approaches to measure systemic risks and break it down into contributions of different institutions. The main of the present paper is to estimate the systemic risk of European banks following the financial crisis of 2007. To do so, we estimate the systemic risk of a sample composed of 281 financial institutions grouped in 16 European countries during the period from January 01, 2006 to December 31, 2012. We use the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) to measure systemic risk. The empirical show that the systemic risk supported by European banks is very high. Moreover, the contribution of financial institutions in the risk of their system is very important as a result of the high correlation between institution returns and market returns. This correlation is measured by DECO-GARCH (1,1) introduced for the first time to assess systemic risk of financial institutions. This high level of systemic risk prompted the international authorities to intervene, as is the case of the countries of the Euro zone, where the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the World Bank intervened but did not lead to a permanent solution to limit the accumulation of systemic risk.",2016,2016-05-01,21,Research in International Business and Finance,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","Derbali, A.

"Lin, E.M.H.; Sun, E.W.; Yu, M.","Systemic risk, financial markets, and performance of financial institutions","This paper studies the exposure and contribution of financial institutions to systemic risks in financial markets. We employ three popular indicators of a financial institution’s exposure to systemic risks: the systemic risk index (SRISK) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) of Brownlees and Engle (Volatility, correlation and tails for systemic risk measurement, Social Science Research Network, Rochester, NY, 2012) and the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). We use a primary database of Taiwan financial institutions for our empirical study. A panel contains data of stock market returns and balance sheets of 31 Taiwan financial institutions for 2005 2014. We focus on systemic risk analysis so as to understand the dynamics of volatility, interdependency, and risk during the recent financial crisis. We then report the time series dynamics and cross sectional rankings of these systemic risk measures. The main indicate that although these three measures differ in their definition of the contributions to systemic risk, all are quite similar in identifying systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Moreover, we find empirical evidence that systemic risk contributions are closely related to certain institution characteristic factors.

However, work over the past several decades has established that atherosclerotic plaque development involves a complex coordination of both systemic and local cues that ultimately determine where plaques form and how plaques progress. Although current therapeutics for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease primarily target the systemic risk factors, a large array of studies suggest that the local microenvironment, including arterial mechanics, matrix remodelling and lipid deposition, plays a vital role in regulating the local susceptibility to plaque development through the regulation of vascular cell function. Additionally, these microenvironmental stimuli are capable of tuning other aspects of the microenvironment through collective adaptation. In this review, we will discuss the components of the arterial microenvironment, how these components cross-talk to shape the local microenvironment, and the effect of microenvironmental stimuli on vascular cell function during atherosclerotic plaque formation.",2016,2016-05-11,121,Biochemical Journal,"animals; atherosclerosis; endothelium, vascular; humans; models, biological; plaque, atherosclerotic; risk factors",31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,"Yurdagul, A.

An empirical implementation reveals that the primitive asset structure and interbank connections are main drivers of each bank's systemic risk. In addition, different types of interbank linkages (debt or share) make significant differences in affecting an individual bank's systemic risk.",2016,2016-04-06,4,Pacific Economic Review,,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,"Lin, J.

In this setting, aspiration thrombectomy with Indigo has the greatest advantage of not increasing systemic risk of bleeding. The Indigo system from Penumbra (Alameda, CA, USA) promotes active thrombectomy using a vacuum pump that generates substantial suction, enabling aspiration of clots of varying sizes and lengths. The device has three components: aspiration catheter, separator and pump. There areaspiration catheter sizes: CATand CAT 5. The separators are intended to mobilize the clot and clean the catheter lumen, and therefore restoring flow for continuous aspiration. The pump is small-sized equipment capable of applying near pure vacuum aspiration pressure of -29 mmHg. Aspiration thrombectomy with Indigo has two key advantages: it does not require the use of lytics, and it provides immediate flow reestablishment.

To enable assessment of healthcare value in stroke management, an international standard set of patient-centered stroke outcome measures was defined for use in a variety of healthcare settings. METHODS: A modified Delphi process was implemented with an international expert panel representing patients, advocates, and clinical specialists in stroke outcomes, stroke registers, global health, epidemiology, and rehabilitation to reach consensus on the preferred outcome measures, included populations, and baseline risk adjustment variables.Patients presenting to a hospital with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage were selected as the target population for these recommendations, with the inclusion of transient ischemic attacks optional. Outcome categories recommended for assessment were survival and disease control, acute complications, and patient-reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes proposed for assessment at 90 days were pain, mood, feeding, selfcare, mobility, communication, cognitive functioning, social participation, ability to return to usual activities, and health-related quality of life, with mobility, feeding, selfcare, and communication also collected at discharge. One instrument was able to collect most patient-reported subdomains (9 16, 56%). Minimum data collection for risk adjustment included patient demographics, premorbid functioning, stroke type and severity, vascular and systemic risk factors, and specific treatment care-related factors.A consensus stroke measure Standard Set was developed as a simple, pragmatic method to increase the value of stroke care.

"Vozza, I.; Fusco, F.; Corridore, D.; Ottolenghi, L.",Awareness of complications and maintenance mode of oral piercing in a group of adolescents and young italian adults with intraoral piercing,"The aim of the study was to focus the awareness of complications of oral piercing among a group of adolescents and young Italian adults with intraoral piercings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 225 teenagers were asked to complete a questionnaire on the awareness of complications of oral piercing. An additional questionnaire was administered in case of oral piercing worn, based on site piercing, knowledge about piercer license, oral and systemic risks due to oral piercing, disinfection and sterilization of the material pierced, information by the piercer about piercing hygiene maintenance and post-piercing dentist check-up. After questionnaire all participants received a brochure with some information about risks and maintenance mode of piercing.Data revealed that more than 50% of teens surveyed was found to wear a piercing. Only 25.3% was aware of the risk of HCV cross-infection and only 17.3% reported of knowledge about risk of endocarditis. Only 17% checked the piercer license and only 18% sterilization and disinfection of the materials used. 53.7% did not received explanations about the risks associated with piercing. With regard to the maintenance mode of the piercing, it has been suggested to brush the piercing bar in 17% of cases. The post piercing specialist visits have been suggested only in 7% of cases.The general lack of awareness of complications and maintenance mode related to oral piercing needs to be addressed by some education programs performed at school and by dentists.",2015,2015-07-01,6,Medicina Oral Patología Oral y Cirugia Bucal,"adolescent; body piercing; female; health knowledge, attitudes, practice; humans; italy; male; oral hygiene; surveys and questionnaires; young adult",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Vozza, I.

"Masys, A.J.; Yee, E.; Vallerand, A.","Black swans’, Dragon kings’ and beyond: towards predictability and suppression of extreme all-hazards events through modeling and simulation","Shocks to regional, national and global systems stemming from natural or man-made hazards can have dramatic implications. Disasters such as Katrina (2005), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) Floods (2013), and Super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are examples that highlight the vulnerability of communities to natural hazards and the crippling effect they have on the social and economic well-being. Through foresight and scenario planning, such events can be expected but can they be predicted to support resilience and enable suppression of the impacts With consideration of emerging and systemic risks and inherent uncertainty associated with surprising events, planning for and managing risk, crisis and disasters requires understanding of the outliers that challenge our resilience. Black Swans’ represent the unpredictable. They represent our misunderstanding of the likelihood of surprises (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable, 2007). A Black Swan’ is described by Taleb (2007) as that which is an outlier, that which is outside the realm of regular expectations which carries with it an extreme impact such as natural disasters, market crashes, catastrophic failure of complex socio-technical systems and terrorist events such as11. Sornette (IntTerraspace Sci Eng 2(1):1 18, 2009) identifies a different class of extreme events (outliers) that he calls Dragon Kings’. Sornette (2009) argues that Dragon Kings may have properties that make them not only identifiable in real time but also predictable. The evolving science on complexity (and, more specifically, on complex networks) and on resilience suggest that modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, and financial events. Furthermore, the science of complex networks is developing rapidly and has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of complexity, potentially leading to innovative methods for the prediction of emergent behavior on natural and technological networks, as well as specific strategies for designing networks that are more resistant (resilient) to both failure and attack. Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible Dragon-King type of low probability extremely high consequence extreme events, as well as from the utilization of recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency. This chapter contributes to the discourse on Dragon Kings arguing for continued and concerted efforts to explore this domain.",2015,2015-09-15,5,Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 37 Earth Sciences; 3701 Atmospheric Sciences","Masys, A.J.

"Heiberger, R.H.",Collective attention and stock prices: evidence from google trends data on standard and poor's 100,"Todayconnected world allows people to gather information in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. As a dramatic economic event, recent financial crisis increased public interest for large companies considerably. In this paper, we exploit this change in information gathering behavior by utilizing Google query volumes as a ""bad news"" indicator for each corporation listed in the Standard and Poor100 index.

"Kang, J.; Park, B.; Cho, B.J.",Comparison of risk factors for initial central scotoma versus initial peripheral scotoma in normal-tension glaucoma,"PURPOSE: To investigate the risk factors for initial central scotoma (ICS) compared with initial peripheral scotoma (IPS) in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). METHODS: Fifty-six NTG patients (56 eyes) with an ICS and 103 NTG patients (103 eyes) with an IPS were included. Retrospectively, the differences were assessed between the two groups for baseline characteristics, ocular factors, systemic factors, and lifestyle factors. Also, the mean deviation of visual field was compared between the two groups.Patients from both ICS and IPS groups were of similar age, gender, family history of glaucoma, and follow-up periods. Frequency of disc hemorrhage was significantly higher among patients with ICS than in patients with IPS. Moreover, systemic risk factors such as hypotension, migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, and snoring were more prevalent in the ICS group than in the IPS group. There were no statistical differences in lifestyle risk factors such as smoking or body mass index. Pattern standard deviation was significantly greater in the ICS group than in the IPS group, but the mean deviation was similar between the two groups.NTG Patients with ICS and IPS have different profiles of risk factors and clinical characteristics. This suggests that the pattern of initial visual field loss may be useful to identify patients at higher risk of central field loss.",2015,2015-03-17,22,Korean Journal of Ophthalmology,female; humans; incidence; intraocular pressure; low tension glaucoma; male; middle aged; optic disk; republic of korea; retrospective studies; risk assessment; risk factors; scotoma; visual fields,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Kang, J.

"Cimini, G.; Squartini, T.; Gabrielli, A.; Garlaschelli, D.",Estimating topological properties of weighted networks from limited information,"A problem typically encountered when studying complex systems is the limitedness of the information available on their topology, which hinders our understanding of their structure and of the dynamical processes taking place on them. A paramount example is provided by financial networks, whose data are privacy protected: Banks publicly disclose only their aggregate exposure towards other banks, keeping individual exposures towards each single bank secret. Yet, the estimation of systemic risk strongly depends on the detailed structure of the interbank network. The resulting challenge is that of using aggregate information to statistically reconstruct a network and correctly predict its higher-order properties. Standard approaches either generate unrealistically dense networks, or fail to reproduce the observed topology by assigning homogeneous link weights. Here, we develop a reconstruction method, based on statistical mechanics concepts, that makes use of the empirical link density in a highly nontrivial way. Technically, our approach consists in the preliminary estimation of node degrees from empirical node strengths and link density, followed by a maximum-entropy inference based on a combination of empirical strengths and estimated degrees. Our method is successfully tested on the international trade network and the interbank money market, and represents a valuable tool for gaining insights on privacy-protected or partially accessible systems.",2015,2015-10-08,47,Physical Review E,,40 Engineering; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 51 Physical Sciences,"Cimini, G.

This elevated exposure to Au-NPs poses systemic risks in humans, particularly risks associated with the biodistribution of Au-NPs and their potent interaction with biological barriers. We treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with Au-NPs and comprehensively examined the expression levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5, junctional adhesion molecules, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), as well as endothelial paracellular permeability and the intracellular signaling required for TJ organization. Moreover, we validated the effects of Au-NPs on the integrity of TJs in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and obtained direct evidence of their influence on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in vivo. Treatment with Au-NPs caused a pronounced reduction of PKCζ-dependent threonine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1, which resulted in the instability of endothelial TJs and led to proteasome-mediated degradation of TJ components. This impairment in the assembly of TJs between endothelial cells increased the permeability of the transendothelial paracellular passage and the BBB. Au-NPs increased endothelial paracellular permeability in vitro and elevated BBB permeability in vivo. Future studies must investigate the direct and indirect toxicity caused by Au-NP-induced endothelial TJ opening and thereby address the double-edged-sword effect of Au-NPs.",2015,2015-08-13,64,Toxicological Sciences,"animals; blood-brain barrier; capillary permeability; cell line, tumor; cells, cultured; drug carriers; endothelium, vascular; gene expression regulation; gold; humans; male; metal nanoparticles; mice, inbred icr; nerve tissue proteins; particle size; phosphorylation; proteasome endopeptidase complex; protein kinase c; protein processing, post-translational; tight junction proteins; tight junctions; toxicokinetics",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3206 Medical Biotechnology; 3208 Medical Physiology,"Li, C.

"Ellinas, C.; Allan, N.; Durugbo, C.; Johansson, A.",How robust is your project from local failures to global catastrophes: A complex networks approach to project systemic risk,"Current societal requirements necessitate the effective delivery of complex projects that can do more while using less. Yet, recent large-scale project failures suggest that our ability to successfully deliver them is still at its infancy. Such failures can be seen to arise through various failure mechanisms this work focuses on one such mechanism. Specifically, it examines the likelihood of a project sustaining a large-scale catastrophe, as triggered by single task failure and delivered via a cascading process. To do so, an analytical model was developed and tested on an empirical dataset by the means of numerical simulation. This paper makes three main contributions. First, it provides a methodology to identify the tasks most capable of impacting a project. In doing so, it is noted that a significant number of tasks induce no cascades, while a handful are capable of triggering surprisingly large ones. Secondly, it illustrates that crude task characteristics cannot aid in identifying them, highlighting the complexity of the underlying process and the utility of this approach. Thirdly, it draws parallels with systems encountered within the natural sciences by noting the emergence of self-organised criticality, commonly found within natural systems. These findings strengthen the need to account for structural intricacies of a project's underlying task precedence structure as they can provide the conditions upon which large-scale catastrophes materialise.",2015,2015-11-25,27,Plos One,"algorithms; models, theoretical","33 Built Environment and Design; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","Ellinas, C.

METHODS: Questionnaires were conducted in 365 POAG patients to assess history of falls and falls with injury and general patient health. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relationship between visual function, as measured by a patient's binocular integrated visual field and visual acuity (VA), general health and the risks of falling and injurious falls.Among the 365 subjects, 55 subjects experienced falls in the past year. A significant difference was observed in worse-eye VA between the faller and non-faller groups (p 0.03). SEM of fallers obtained a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.035 and a Comparative Fit Index (CFI) of 0.99. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) of regression coefficients from this model suggested better VA and worse VA were significant risk factors for falling. Among the 55 fallers, 22 subjects experienced an associated injury. There was a significant difference in gender between the non-injurious and injurious faller groups (p 0.002). SEM of injurious fallers obtained a RMSEA of 0.074 and a CFI of 0.97. In this SEM model, the 95% CI of regression coefficients suggested gender and average total deviation values in the lower peripheral visual field were significant risk factors for an injurious fall.This study suggests that worse-eye and better-eye VAs are associated with falls.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of complete ophthalmic examinations, including fluorescein angiography and visual field testing, performed on all patients with the first attack of acute NA-AION admitted to our department during the period of ten years (2004 to 2013). Of 120 NA-AION patients, 10 (8.3 %) were under 50 years of age.The majority of these were men:of 10 (80 %). The average best corrected visual acuity on admission was 0.34 (fingers counted up to 1.0) and on discharge 0.53 (fingers counted up to 1.0). Of 10 eyes,were emmetropic andhyperopic, from 0.50to 2.0 D. Aside from the clinical picture of AION, other ophthalmological findings were normal. In fluorescein angiography, typical changes for ischaemic optic neuropathy were observed in all patients. In a majority of patients, an inferior altitudinal visual field defect was found. As regards systemic risk factors, hyperlipidaemia was observed in 7, arterial hypertension in 3, diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy in 3, and ischaemic heart disease inof 10 patients. One patient was treated for rheumatoid arthritis without signs of vasculitis. Inpatients, more than one systemic risk factor was observed. Two of our patients had no systemic risk factors except moderate hyperopia. Bilateral manifestation was observed only in one patientmonths after the first attack. None of the patients experienced recurrent attacks. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of younger patients in our study was lower than in previous studies. The reason could be the better medical prevention in our region. Our study confirmed that even in young NA-AION patients, moderate hyperopia could be a predisposing factor.

"Smerlak, M.; Stoll, B.; Gupta, A.; Magdanz, J.S.",Mapping systemic risk: critical degree and failures distribution in financial networks,"The financial crisis illustrated the need for a functional understanding of systemic risk in strongly interconnected financial structures. Dynamic processes on complex networks being intrinsically difficult to model analytically, most recent studies of this problem have relied on numerical simulations. Here we report analytical in a network model of interbank lending based on directly relevant financial parameters, such as interest rates and leverage ratios.

"Slots, J.","Periodontal herpesviruses: prevalence, pathogenicity, systemic risk","Periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease characterized by the loss of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Herpesviruses are frequent inhabitants of periodontitis lesions, and the periodontopathogenicity of these viruses is the topic of this review. In 26 recent studies from 15 countries, subgingival cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex virus type 1, respectively, yielded median prevalences of 49%, 45% and 63% in aggressive periodontitis, 40%, 32% and 45% in chronic periodontitis, and 3%, 7% and 12% in healthy periodontium. An active herpesvirus infection of the periodontium exhibits site specificity, is a potent stimulant of cellular immunity, may cause upgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria and tends to be related to disease-active periodontitis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by the herpesvirus infection may activate matrix metalloproteinases and osteoclasts, leading to breakdown of the tooth-supportive tissues. The notion that a co-infection of herpesviruses and specific bacteria causes periodontitis provides a plausible etiopathogenic explanation for the disease. Moreover, herpesvirus virions from periodontal sites may dislodge into saliva or enter the systemic circulation and cause diseases beyond the periodontium. Periodontal treatment can diminish significantly the periodontal load of herpesviruses, which may lower the incidence and magnitude of herpesvirus dissemination within and between individuals, and subsequently the risk of acquiring a variety of medical diseases. Novel and more effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis and related diseases may depend on a better understanding of the herpesvirus-bacteria-immune response axis.",2015,2015-08-07,87,Periodontology 2000,"aggressive periodontitis; bacterial infections; chronic periodontitis; cytokines; herpesviridae; herpesviridae infections; humans; immunity, cellular; periodontium; risk factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Slots, J.

We model this process with an urn scheme that runs until hitting a threshold, and we characterize an inherent tradeoff between the speed and the accuracy of a decision. The proposed common mechanism provides a robust and effective means by which a decentralized system can navigate the speed-accuracy tradeoff and make reasonably good, quick decisions in a variety of environments. Additionally, consensus choice exhibits systemic risk aversion even while individuals are idiosyncratically risk-neutral. This too is adaptive. The model illustrates how natural systems make decentralized decisions, illuminating a mechanism that engineers of social and artificial systems could imitate.",2015,2015-09-04,9,Science Advances,,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,"Golman, R.

METHODS: A subset of papers published in the peer-reviewed literature were selected.Major innovations in retina include: (1) advances in the treatment of diabetic macular edema, including the use of aflibercept and sustained delivery dexamethasone intravitreal implants as well as subthreshold micropulse diode laser therapy (2) reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein, and zeaxanthin supplements as reported in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study-2 (3) use of enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography for choroidal imaging (4) use of gene therapy to treat choroideremia (5) use of combination pharmacotherapy (i.e., squalamine ranibizumab) and gene therapy to treat the neovascular complications of AMD and (6) use of stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium transplants to treat atrophic AMD and Stargardt macular dystrophy. In addition, we review the ocular and systemic risks associated with sustained intraocular steroid delivery and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways. We also review potential applications of gene- versus cell-based therapy for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.Several treatment approaches are effective in the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Prophylaxis against AMD progression with Age-Related Eye Disease Study-2 supplements seems to reduce the risk of developing neovascular but not atrophic complications of AMD.

"Koskinas, K.C.; Windecker, S.; Räber, L.",Regression of coronary atherosclerosis: current evidence and future perspectives,"Coronary atherosclerosis has been considered a chronic disease characterized by ongoing progression in response to systemic risk factors and local pro-atherogenic stimuli. As our understanding of the pathobiological mechanisms implicated in atherogenesis and plaque progression is evolving, effective treatment strategies have been developed that led to substantial reduction of the clinical manifestations and acute complications of coronary atherosclerotic disease. More recently, intracoronary imaging modalities have enabled detailed in vivo quantification and characterization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, serial evaluation of atherosclerotic changes over time, and assessment of vascular responses to effective anti-atherosclerotic medications. The use of intracoronary imaging modalities has demonstrated that intensive lipid lowering can halt plaque progression and may even result in regression of coronary atheroma when the highest doses of the most potent statins are used. While current evidence indicates the feasibility of atheroma regression and of reversal of presumed high-risk plaque characteristics in response to intensive anti-atherosclerotic therapies, these changes of plaque size and composition are modest and their clinical implications remain largely elusive. Growing interest has focused on achieving more pronounced regression of coronary plaque using novel anti-atherosclerotic medications, and more importantly on elucidating ways toward clinical translation of favorable changes of plaque anatomy into more favorable clinical outcomes for our patients.",2015,2015-05-19,23,Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine,"anticholesteremic agents; coronary artery disease; disease progression; humans; patient outcome assessment; plaque, atherosclerotic",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Koskinas, K.C.

In recent years, studies have shown that the origins of CVD may be traced to vascular and metabolic processes in early life. Retinal vascular imaging is a new technology that allows detailed non-invasive in vivo assessment and monitoring of the microvasculature. In this systematic review, we described the application of retinal vascular imaging in children and adolescents, and we examined the use of retinal vascular imaging in understanding CVD risk in early life. We reviewed all publications with quantitative retinal vascular assessment in two databases: PubMed and Scopus. Early life CVD risk factors were classified into four groups: birth risk factors, environmental risk factors, systemic risk factors and conditions linked to future CVD development. Retinal vascular changes were associated with lower birth weight, shorter gestational age, low-fibre and high-sugar diet, lesser physical activity, parental hypertension history, childhood hypertension, childhood overweight obesity, childhood depression anxiety and childhood typediabetes mellitus. In summary, there is increasing evidence supporting the view that structural changes in the retinal microvasculature are associated with CVD risk factors in early life. Thus, the retina is a useful site for pre-clinical assessment of microvascular processes that may underlie the future development of CVD in adulthood.",2015,2015-11-23,39,the Journal of Physiology,"adolescent; birth weight; cardiovascular diseases; child; female; humans; infant, newborn; male; metabolic diseases; retinal diseases; retinal vessels",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,"Li, L.

The patient's history was significant for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our pressing diagnostic concern was to determine if his vision loss and bilateral optic disc changes represented lymphomatous infiltrates. A complete ocular exam demonstrated findings consistent with simultaneous bilateral NAAION. After an extensive systemic workup for malignancy with central nervous system involvement, vasculitis, and other entities associated with NAAION, we determined that the patient's primary risk factor for developing bilateral ischemic optic neuropathies was his crowded optic discs.

In the case of economic and financial networks, privacy issues severely limit the information that can be accessed and, as a consequence, the possibility of correctly estimating the resilience of these systems to events such as financial shocks, crises and cascade failures. Here we present an innovative method to reconstruct the structure of such partially-accessible systems, based on the knowledge of intrinsic node-specific properties and of the number of connections of only a limited subset of nodes. This information is used to calibrate an inference procedure based on fundamental concepts derived from statistical physics, which allows to generate ensembles of directed weighted networks intended to represent the real system so that the real network properties can be estimated as their average values within the ensemble. We test the method both on synthetic and empirical networks, focusing on the properties that are commonly used to measure systemic risk.

We show that supply risk, scarcity, and price volatility of nonfuel mineral resources are intricately connected with the structure of the worldwide trade networks spanned by these resources. At the global level, we demonstrate that the scarcity of a resource is closely related to the susceptibility of the trade network with respect to cascading shocks. At the regional level, we find that, to some extent, region-specific price volatility and supply risk can be understood by centrality measures that capture systemic trade risk.

A systematic review of the association of OSA and NAION has not been performed. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was performed to assess such potential association between OSA and risk of NAION. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed for published studies evaluating the association between OSA and NAION. The summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical risk estimates. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed to assess the robustness of pooled outcomes.A total of four prospective cohort studies and one case-control study met our inclusion criteria. The pooled OR of developing NAION in the subjects with OSA was 6.18 (95% CI, 2.00-19.11) versus non-OSA controls. Sensitivity analyses showed that no matter one study excluded, the pooled OR did not change significantly, which indicated that the evidence was robust. In subgroup analyses, a significant association was seen in studies matched systemic risk factors (OR, 5.00 95% CI, 2.22-11.25), but not in those non-matched. The magnitude and direction of effects were also affected by methodological variability, including study design, and diagnosis of OSA.The findings from this meta-analysis supported the robust evidence that OSA was a strong independent risk factor of NAION. Relative to non-OSA controls, the subjects with OSA were found to have a more than sixfold risk of NAION. In future, more well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.",2015,2015-10-07,55,Current Eye Research,"humans; optic neuropathy, ischemic; polysomnography; risk factors; sleep apnea, obstructive",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Wu, Y.

Systemic risk in the financial system arises to a large extent as a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange, and securities. The interplay of the various exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007 to 2013. We show that focusing on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90%. By assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected systemic losses are up to a factor of four higher now than before the financial crisis of 2007 2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of one thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates the total risk. The method presented here is the first data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels.",2015,2015-10-01,233,Journal of Financial Stability,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Poledna, S.

"Elliott, J.R.; Frickel, S.",Urbanization as socioenvironmental succession: the case of hazardous industrial site accumulation,"This study rehabilitates concepts from classical human ecology and synthesizes them with contemporary urban and environmental sociology to advance a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. The theory illuminates how social and biophysical phenomena interact endogenously at the local level to situate urban land use patterns recursively and reciprocally in place. To demonstrate this theory we conduct a historical-comparative analysis of hazardous industrial site accumulation in four U.S. cities, using a relational database that was assembled for more than 11,000 facilities that operated during the past half century--most of which remain unacknowledged in government reports. show how three iterative processes--hazardous industrial churning, residential churning, and risk containment--intersect to produce successive socioenvironmental changes that are highly relevant to but often missed by research on urban growth machines, environmental inequality, and systemic risk.",2015,2015-05-01,30,American Journal of Sociology,cities; environment; hazardous waste sites; humans; risk; social environment; socioeconomic factors; united states; urban population; urbanization,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography,"Elliott, J.R.

BRONJ was classified intogroups, with bone exposure (Stage 1-3 BRONJ) or without (StageBRONJ). In each patient, 15 transaxial CT images were selected and 30 configured regions of interest (ROI) were identified. The ANOVA test was applied to test the relationship between the severity of systemic risk factors.Regarding the local status of the mandible, significant differences were observed among the StageBRONJ, Stage 1-3 BRONJ, non-BRONJ and control groups in the cancellous bone CT radiodensity values, but there were no significant differences between the Stageand Stage 1-3 BRONJ groups.

To this end, we rely on the ΔCoVaR systemic risk measure introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). In order to provide a formal ranking of the financial sectors with respect to their contribution to systemic risk, the original ΔCoVaR approach is extended here to include the Kolmogorov Smirnov test developed by Abadie (2002), based on bootstrapping. Our empirical reveal that in the Eurozone, for the period ranging from 2004 to 2012, the other financial services sector contributes relatively the most to systemic risk at times of distress affecting this sector. In turn, the banking sector appears to contribute more to systemic risk than the insurance sector. By contrast, the insurance industry is the systemically riskiest financial sector in the United States for the same period, while the banking sector contributes the least to systemic risk in this area. Beyond this ranking, the three financial sectors of interest are found to contribute significantly to systemic risk, both in the Eurozone and in the United States.",2014,2014-10-01,122,Journal of Banking & Finance,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Bernal, O.

However, the prevalence of the group of mutated genotypes (AC CC) of the missense variant MTHFR A1298C was significantly different between patients and controls (16.67% vs. 6.42%,.01). Additionally, the frequency of the CT genotype as well as the group of combined mutated genotypes (CT TT) for the C677T variant was significantly higher among RVO patients compared with controls (p 10(-3),10(-3)).

In other instances, influential ""actors"" take the form of climate change, communications technologies, or socioeconomic globalization. Although these individual forces may be small relative to state governments or international institutions, or may operate on long time scales, the changes they catalyze can pose significant challenges to the analysis and practice of international relations through the operation of complex feedbacks and interactions of individual agents and interconnected systems. We call these challenges ""femtorisks,"" and emphasize their importance for two reasons. First, in isolation, they may be inconsequential and semiautonomous but when embedded in complex adaptive systems, characterized by individual agents able to change, learn from experience, and pursue their own agendas, the strategic interaction between actors can propel systems down paths of increasing, even global, instability. Second, because their influence stems from complex interactions at interfaces of multiple systems (e.g., social, financial, political, technological, ecological, etc.), femtorisks challenge standard approaches to risk assessment, as higher-order consequences cascade across the boundaries of socially constructed complex systems.

DME, which is characterized by cystic retinal thickening or lipid deposition, is prone to relapse after successful treatment. DME is a complex pathological process caused by multiple factors, including breakdown of the inner and outer blood-retinal barriers, oxidative stress, and elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor which have been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. Starling’s law theory explains many of the features of DME. Early detection and treatment of DME can prevent vision loss. Current effective interventions for DME include treatment of systemic risk factors, such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ophthalmic treatments include laser photocoagulation, surgery and intraocular pharmacotherapy. New drugs, which are given by intraocular injection, have emerged in recent years to become first line treatment for DME that affects the central macula with loss of vision.

The molecular mechanisms that link disturbed flow-generated mechanical forces with arterial injury are uncertain. To illuminate them, we investigated the effects of flow on endothelial cell (EC) senescence. APPROACH ANDLDLR(- -) (low-density lipoprotein receptor(- -)) mice were exposed to a high-fat diet forto 12 weeks (or to a normal chow diet as a control) before the assessment of cellular senescence in aortic ECs. En face staining revealed that senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and p53 expression were elevated in ECs at sites of disturbed flow in response to a high-fat diet. By contrast, ECs exposed to undisturbed flow did not express senescence-associated β-galactosidase or p53. Studies of aortae from healthy pigs (agedmonths) also revealed enhanced senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining at sites of disturbed flow. These data suggest that senescent ECs accumulate at disturbed flow sites during atherogenesis. We used in vitro flow systems to examine whether a causal relationship exists between flow and EC senescence. Exposure of cultured ECs to flow (using either an orbital shaker or a syringe-pump flow bioreactor) revealed that disturbed flow promoted EC senescence compared with static conditions, whereas undisturbed flow reduced senescence. Gene silencing studies demonstrated that disturbed flow induced EC senescence via a p53-p21 signaling pathway. Disturbed flow-induced senescent ECs exhibited reduced migration compared with nonsenescent ECs in a scratch wound closure assay, and thus may be defective for arterial repair. However, pharmacological activation of sirtuin(using resveratrol or SRT1720) protected ECs from disturbed flow-induced senescence.Disturbed flow promotes endothelial senescence via a p53-p21-dependent pathway which can be inhibited by activation of sirtuin 1. These observations support the principle that pharmacological activation of sirtuinmay promote cardiovascular health by suppressing EC senescence at atheroprone sites.",2014,2014-03-20,158,Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology,"animals; aortic diseases; atherosclerosis; bioreactors; cell movement; cells, cultured; cellular senescence; cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21; diet, high-fat; disease models, animal; endothelial cells; enzyme activation; enzyme activators; human umbilical vein endothelial cells; humans; mechanotransduction, cellular; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; receptors, ldl; regional blood flow; rna interference; sirtuin 1; stress, mechanical; swine; time factors; transfection; tumor suppressor protein p53; wound healing",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Warboys, C.M.

"Ren, F.; Zhou, W.",Dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the chinese stock market,"The analysis of cross-correlations is extensively applied for the understanding of interconnections in stock markets and the portfolio risk estimation. Current studies of correlations in Chinese market mainly focus on the static correlations between return series, and this calls for an urgent need to investigate their dynamic correlations. Our study aims to reveal the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chinese stock market, and offer an exact interpretation for the evolution behavior. The correlation matrices constructed from the return series of 367 A-share stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2011 are calculated over a moving window with a size of 400 days. The evolutions of the statistical properties of the correlation coefficients, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the correlation matrices are carefully analyzed. We find that the stock correlations are significantly increased in the periods of two market crashes in 2001 and 2008, during which only five eigenvalues significantly deviate from the random correlation matrix, and the systemic risk is higher in these volatile periods than calm periods. By investigating the significant contributors of the deviating eigenvectors in different time periods, we observe a dynamic evolution behavior in business sectors such as IT, electronics, and real estate, which lead the rise (drop) before (after) the crashes. Our provide new perspectives for the understanding of the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chines stock markets, and the result of risk estimation is valuable for the application of risk management.",2014,2014-05-27,36,Plos One,"algorithms; commerce; humans; investments; marketing; models, economic; risk management; time factors","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Ren, F.

"Macrae, C.","Early warnings, weak signals and learning from healthcare disasters","In the wake of healthcare disasters, such as the appalling failures of care uncovered in Mid Staffordshire, inquiries and investigations often point to a litany of early warnings and weak signals that were missed, misunderstood or discounted by the professionals and organisations charged with monitoring the safety and quality of care. Some of the most urgent challenges facing those responsible for improving and regulating patient safety are therefore how to identify, interpret, integrate and act on the early warnings and weak signals of emerging risks-before those risks contribute to a disastrous failure of care. These challenges are fundamentally organisational and cultural: they relate to what information is routinely noticed, communicated and attended to within and between healthcare organisations-and, most critically, what is assumed and ignored. Analysing these organisational and cultural challenges suggests three practical ways that healthcare organisations and their regulators can improve safety and address emerging risks. First, engage in practices that actively produce and amplify fleeting signs of ignorance. Second, work to continually define and update a set of specific fears of failure. And third, routinely uncover and publicly circulate knowledge on the sources of systemic risks to patient safety and the improvements required to address them.",2014,2014-03-05,61,Bmj Quality & Safety,disasters; england; hospital administration; hospitals; humans; malpractice,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,"Macrae, C.

"Kobayashi, T.; Hasui, K.",Efficient immunization strategies to prevent financial contagion,"Many immunization strategies have been proposed to prevent infectious viruses from spreading through a network. In this work, we study efficient immunization strategies to prevent a default contagion that might occur in a financial network. An essential difference from the previous studies on immunization strategy is that we take into account the possibility of serious side effects. Uniform immunization refers to a situation in which banks are vaccinated with a common low-risk asset. The riskiness of immunized banks will decrease significantly, but the level of systemic risk may increase due to the de-diversification effect. To overcome this side effect, we propose another immunization strategy, called counteractive immunization, which prevents pairs of banks from failing simultaneously. We find that counteractive immunization can efficiently reduce systemic risk without altering the riskiness of individual banks.",2014,2014-01-23,22,Scientific Reports,"computer simulation; economic recession; financial management; humans; models, economic; risk sharing, financial","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Kobayashi, T.

This study investigates whether vitrectomy without tumor resection improves the clinical outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective interventional case series. Twenty patients with choroidal melanoma with exudative retinal detachment involving the macula were treated by vitrectomy, endodrainage, photocoagulation, and silicone oil tamponade after proton beam therapy.The mean follow-up was 38.4 months (median 21.5, range 12.0-122.0). The mean time between proton beam therapy and surgery was 4.5 months (range 0.1-9.2). Reattachment was achieved in 95% of the patients after one vitrectomy. One patient was lost to follow-up because enucleation was performed after 45.9 months due to a secondary glaucoma. Mean visual acuity decreased from 1.1 to 1.8 logMAR before vitrectomy and afteryears, respectively. No patient showed local tumor recurrence. Metastatic disease was present inpatient after 15.2 months, and this patient died after 19.2 months.

This study aimed at exploring in vivo the relationship between local endothelial shear stress (ESS) and coronary plaque characteristics in humans using computational fluid dynamics and frequency-domain optical coherence tomography. METHODS ANDThree-dimensional coronary artery reconstruction was performed in 21 patients (24 arteries) presenting with acute coronary syndrome using frequency-domain optical coherence tomography and coronary angiography. Each coronary artery was divided into sequential 3-mm segments and analyzed for the assessment of local ESS and plaque characteristics. A total of 146 nonculprit segments were evaluated. Compared with segments with higher ESS Pascal (Pa)those with low ESS1 Pa) showed higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaques (37.5% versus 20.0% 0.019) and thin-cap fibroatheroma (12.5% versus 2.0% 0.037). Overall, lipid plaques in segments with low ESS had thinner fibrous cap (115 μm 63-166 versus 170 μm 107-219 0.004) and higher macrophage density (normalized standard deviation: 8.4% 4.8-12.6 versus 6.2% 4.2-8.8 0.017). Segments with low ESS showed more superficial calcifications (minimum calcification depth: 93 μm 50-140 versus 152 μm 105-258 0.049) and tended to have higher prevalence of spotty calcifications (26.0% versus 12.0% 0.076).Coronary regions exposed to low ESS are associated with larger lipid burden, thinner fibrous cap, and higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma in humans.

"Zhang, X.; Wang, N.; Schachat, A.P.; Bao, S.; Gillies, M.C.","Glucocorticoids: structure, signaling and molecular mechanisms in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the working population worldwide. Vascular leakage, angiogenesis and neuronal degeneration are key features of DR. Current effective interventions for DR include treatment of systemic risk factors such as elevated blood glucose, blood pressure and dyslipidemia. Ocular treatments include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) inhibitors, laser photocoagulation and surgery. While anti-VEGF therapy has become as first-line treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) that causes reduced vision, intravitreal glucocorticoids also have been shown to be efficacious in this situation. It has been reported that all the major pathological processes of DR are susceptible to glucocorticoid treatment. The effects of glucocorticoids on vascular leakage and angiogenesis may be mediated through their well established anti-inflammatory role. Alternatively, glucocorticoids may affect other mechanisms known to be activated in DR. Potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids include blockage of cytokine production and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion induced by VEGF-A. Glucocorticoids decrease the expression of VEGF-A directly, and increase the production, or decrease phosphorylation, of tight junction-associated proteins. Glucocorticoids have also been shown to be neuroprotective, in contrast to VEGF-A inhibitors which animal studies suggest may be neurotoxic. This review outlines the biological properties of synthetic glucocorticoids, with particular emphasis on the potential beneficial effect of combining glucocorticoids with anti-VEGF treatment for DME and DR.",2014,2014-03-01,34,Current Molecular Medicine,animals; diabetic retinopathy; glucocorticoids; humans; macular edema,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Zhang, X.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients receiving dental implants between 2008 and 2010 at the Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology were included in the study. As primary outcome parameters, the patients were analyzed according to the following criteria: age, sex, systemic diseases, and indication for therapy. For the inserted implants, the type of surgical procedure, the types of implants placed, postsurgical complications, and early failures were recorded. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify possible local and systemic risk factors for complications. As a secondary outcome, data regarding demographics and surgical procedures were compared with the findings of a historic study group (2002 to 2004).A total of 1,568 patients (792 women and 776 men mean age, 52.6 years) received 2,279 implants. The most frequent indication was a single-tooth gap (52.8%). Augmentative procedures were performed in 60% of the cases. Tissue-level implants (72.1%) were more frequently used than bone-level implants (27.9%). Regarding dimensions of the implants, a diameter of 4.1 mm (59.7%) and a length of 10 mm (55.0%) were most often utilized. An early failure rate of 0.6% was recorded (13 implants). Patients were older and received more implants in the maxilla, and the complexity of surgical interventions had increased when compared to the patient pool of 2002 to 2004. CONCLUSION: Implant therapy performed in a surgical specialty clinic utilizing strict patient selection and evidence-based surgical protocols showed a very low early failure rate of 0.6%.",2014,2014-12-05,52,the International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants,adult; aged; dental implantation; dental implants; dental restoration failure; female; humans; jaw diseases; logistic models; male; maxilla; middle aged; postoperative complications; risk factors,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Brügger, O.E.

"Yun, J.; Moon, H.",Measuring systemic risk in the korean banking sector via dynamic conditional correlation models,"In this paper we study systemic risks in the Korean banking sector by using two famous systemic risk measures the MES (marginal expected shortfall) and CoVaR. To compute both measures we employ Engle's dynamic conditional correlation model. Our empirical analysis shows, first, that although these two systemic risk measures differ in defining the contributions to systemic risk, both are qualitatively very similar in explaining the cross-sectional differences in systemic risk contributions across banks. Second, we find that systemic risk contributions are closely related to certain bank characteristic variables (e.g., VaR (value at risk), size and leverage ratio). However, there are differences between the cross-sectional and the time series dimensions in the effects of these variables.

However, pathogenesis of the condition remains unclear. On the other hand, there are also a few studies suggesting that the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) may compromise optic nerve head perfusion and cause glaucomatous optic neuropathy by creating transient hypoxemia and increasing vascular resistance. In this study, we evaluated the possible association between OSAS and NTG.MethodsWe recruited 24 patients with NTG and 24 age and sex matched controls who were also similar for systemic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT) and hypercholesterolemia. All patients and controls underwent over-night polysomnography (PSG) for the diagnosis of OSAS and calculation of Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI).Patients and controls were statistically similar in terms of age, sex, gender, smoking, systemic risk factors, neck circumference and body mass index. The subjects with AHI 20 were accepted as OSAS. Ten (41.7%) of 24 patients with NTG and(12.5%) of 24 controls had OSAS (p 0.05).The prevalence of OSAS was higher in patients with NTG and the difference between patient and control groups was statistically significant (p 0.05).",2014,2014-03-10,47,Bmc Ophthalmology,"aged; case-control studies; female; humans; low tension glaucoma; male; middle aged; polysomnography; prevalence; prospective studies; risk factors; sleep apnea, obstructive",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Bilgin, G.

"Munro, C.L.",Oral health: something to smile about,"Oral health is integrally linked to overall well-being. This article describes a research program focused on the contribution of poor oral health to systemic illness. Initial investigations examined factors related to streptococcal virulence that were important in dental caries and endocarditis and led to development of immunization strategies in animal models to reduce risk of endocarditis. Clinical investigations related to critically ill adults began with descriptive and observational studies that established the importance of dental plaque in development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and examined existing nursing practices in oral care. Subsequent intervention studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to test oral care protocols in critically ill adults have built on that foundation. The group's first NIH-funded randomized clinical trial tested the effects of toothbrushing and use of chlorhexidine in reducing risk of VAP in critically ill adults and showed that VAP was reduced by topical application of chlorhexidine initiated after intubation, although toothbrushing did not reduce VAP. The study had a rapid and dramatic effect on clinical practice. of the study were published in September 2009 in the American Journal of Critical Care, and in May 2010, the Institute for Health-care Improvement updated the recommendations for the care of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (the ventilator bundle) to include daily oral care with chlorhexidine, referencing the of that study as evidence for the change. Chlorhexidine is now the standard of care for adults receiving mechanical ventilation. Because the effects of chlorhexidine after intubation were so beneficial, a second recently completed NIH-funded randomized clinical trial investigated the impact of chlorhexidine applied before intubation compared with after intubation. Currently a large randomized clinical trial is being launched to determine the optimal frequency of toothbrushing for critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation in an effort to maximize oral health benefits while minimizing systemic risks. The importance of collaboration and mentoring in building nursing science is discussed. Future directions for research also are explored.",2014,2014-07-01,6,American Journal of Critical Care,"administration, topical; animals; anti-infective agents, local; chlorhexidine; critical care nursing; humans; intubation, intratracheal; mouth; nursing research; oral hygiene; pneumonia, ventilator-associated; toothbrushing",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,"Munro, C.L.

We present the case of an IgA-deficient patient whose candidacy for double-lung transplantation was under review in the preoperative period.Clinical featuresA 49-yr-old patient with end-stage chronic obstructive lung disease secondary to deficiencies in IgA and IgG subclasses was being assessed for double-lung transplantation. Early recognition of the ramifications of perioperative transfusion prompted consultation with the transfusion medicine service. This in turn facilitated specialized laboratory testing and the coordinated provision of appropriate blood products for the unpredictable date of transplantation. The theoretical systemic risks of a non-IgA-deficient graft on the sensitized IgA-deficient host were considered. To affirm the patient’s candidacy for transplantation, he was ultimately challenged preoperatively with IgA-containing products in a controlled intensive-care setting.ConclusionThrough a multidisciplinary, a successful transplantation outcome was achieved in an IgA-deficient patient undergoing major surgery.

Most of 30 patients were chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with recurrent nasal polyps or systemic risk factors like asthma and aspirin-intolerance, called refractory rhinosinusitis. SPSS 19.0 software was used to analyze the data.89.3% (25 28) of these patients improved in nasal obstructionyear after operation, and the cure rats was 57.1% (16 28, VAS 0). The level of improvement in nasal obstruction was significantly correlated with pre-operative nasal obstruction severity (r 0.909,0.01). 76.7% (23 30) improved in olfactory functionyear after operation in all 30 patients, and 88.2% improved in patients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). It was also found that olfactory functionyear after operation was significantly related to Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores (r 0.671,0.01), but was not correlated with VAS scores of nasal obstruction (P 0.349).

Specific data on drug users in correctional centres is not available for the majority of countries, including South Africa. The study aimed to identify the attitudes and knowledge of key informant (KI) offender and correctional centre staff regarding drug use, health and systemic-related problems so as to facilitate the long-term planning of activities in the field of drug-use prevention and systems strengthening in correctional centres, including suggestions for the development of appropriate intervention and rehabilitation programmes.MethodA Rapid Assessment Response (RAR) methodology was adopted which included observation, mapping of service providers (SP), KI interviews (staff and offenders) and focus groups (FGs). The study was implemented in Emthonjeni Youth Correctional Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Fifteen KI staff participants were interviewed and 45 KI offenders.Drug use is fairly prevalent in the centre, with tobacco most commonly smoked, followed by cannabis and heroin. The banning of tobacco has also led to black-market features such as transactional sex, violence, gangsterism and smuggling in order to obtain mainly prohibited tobacco products, as well as illicit substances.ConclusionHIV, health and systemic-related risk reduction within the Correctional Service sector needs to focus on measures such as improvement of staff capacity and security measures, deregulation of tobacco products and the development and implementation of comprehensive health promotion programmes.",2014,2014-04-03,6,Harm Reduction Journal,"adolescent; adult; condoms; female; focus groups; health knowledge, attitudes, practice; health personnel; health workforce; hiv infections; humans; illicit drugs; male; middle aged; needs assessment; prisoners; prisons; risk-taking; south africa; substance-related disorders; tuberculosis; unsafe sex; young adult",42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,"dos Santos, M.M.

"Jung, K.I.; Lim, S.A.; Park, H.L.; Park, C.K.",Risk factors for decompression retinopathy after glaucoma surgery,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors for decompression retinopathy after glaucoma surgery. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent a trabeculectomy or Ahmed valve implantation and divided them intogroups by the development of decompression retinopathy. Various factors were compared between thegroups, including age, sex, glaucoma type, previous intraocular surgery, preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), refractive error, axial length, anesthesia, and systemic risk factors such as history of diabetes, hypertension, medication, and a laboratory examination including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).The proportion of eyes with decompression retinopathy was 3.05% (21 of 688 eyes), and 50 control eyes were selected randomly. No significant differences were observed between thegroups in age, systemic disease, glaucoma type, anesthesia, or the incidence rate of postoperative hypotony. Preoperative maximum IOP and the change of IOP was higher (P 0.016, 0.019), PT and aPTT was prolonged (P 0.001, 0.006), and hemoglobin and hematocrit level was lower in patients with decompression retinopathy (P 0.005, 0.002).

"Armaghani, S.J.; Menge, T.J.; Lovejoy, S.A.; Mencio, G.A.; Martus, J.E.",Safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.To establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes-2 μg mL Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis-4 μg mL). Evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 μg mL). SUMMARY OF DATA: The application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population with minimal local and systemic risks. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. METHODS: Topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. Serum and drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the firstpostoperative days (PODs). Complications were recorded.The study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean standard deviation body weight of 44.5 18 kg. Underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). Mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 μg mL (POD 0) to 1.9 μg mL (POD 1) to 1.1 μg mL (POD 2). Mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 μg mL (POD 0) to 251 μg mL (POD 1) to 115 μg mL (POD 2). No vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. One patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. CONCLUSION: Topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 μg mL). There were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications.

This study examined 15-year outcomes among women younger than 40 years treated with breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast radiation therapy (BCT) compared with those treated with modified radical mastectomy (MRM). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Women aged 20 to 39 years with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2003 were identified in a population-based database. Primary outcomes of breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes of local relapse-free survival (LRFS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and compared between BCT and MRM cohorts using log-rank tests. A planned subgroup analysis was performed on patients considered ""ideal"" for BCT (ie, T1N0, negative margins and no extensive ductal carcinoma in situ) and in whom local therapy may have the largest impact on survival because of low systemic risk.965 patients were identified 616 had BCT and 349 had MRM. The median follow-up time was 14.4 years (range, 8.4-23.3 years). Overall, 15-year rates of BCSS (76.0% vs 74.1%,.62), OS (74.2% vs 73.0%,.75), LRFS (85.4% vs 86.5%,.95), LRRFS (82.2% vs 81.6%,.61), and DRFS (74.4% vs 71.6%,.40) were similar between the BCT and MRM cohorts. In the ""ideal"" for BCT subgroup, there were 219 BCT and 67 MRM patients with a median follow-up time of 15.5 years.

We find that systemic risk is not a new phenomenon during the latest banking crisis, but its influence is stronger after 2005. The predictive power of systemic risk declines with predicting time interval. This finding suggests that, immediately before the failure, the influence of systemic risk seems to be largely channeled through and reflected in the worsening balance sheet. This finding helps reconcile the controversy over the role of systemic risk in bank failures.

We investigate the systemic risk and spatiotemporal dynamics of the US housing market (1975 2011) at the state level based on the Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We identify richer economic information in the largest eigenvalues deviating from RMT predictions for the housing market than for stock markets and find that the component signs of the eigenvectors contain either geographical information or the extent of differences in house price growth rates or both. By looking at the evolution of different quantities such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we find that the US housing market experienced six different regimes, which is consistent with the evolution of state clusters identified by the box clustering algorithm and the consensus clustering algorithm on the partial correlation matrices. We find that dramatic increases in the systemic risk are usually accompanied by regime shifts, which provide a means of early detection of housing bubbles.",2014,2014-01-13,79,Scientific Reports,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography","Meng, H.

We examine primary indicators of systemic risk as well as contributing factors that exacerbate vulnerability to systemic events. Evaluation of systemic risk is based on a detailed financial analysis of the insurance industry, its role in the economy, and the interconnectedness of insurers. The primary conclusion is that the core activities of U.S. insurers do not pose systemic risk. However, life insurers are vulnerable to intrasector crises, and both life and property casualty insurers are vulnerable to reinsurance crises. Noncore activities such as financial guarantees and derivatives trading may cause systemic risk, and interconnectedness among financial institutions has grown significantly in recent years. To reduce systemic risk from noncore activities, regulators need to continue efforts to strengthen mechanisms for insurance group supervision.",2014,2014-03-20,139,Journal of Risk & Insurance,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Cummins, J.D.

"Borri, N.; Caccavaio, M.; Di, G.G.; Sorrentino, A.M.",Systemic risk in the italian banking industry,"Systemic risk is the risk of a collapse of the entire financial system, typically triggered by the default of one, or more, interconnected financial institutions. In this paper, we estimate the systemic risk contribution of Italian listed banks for the period 2000 2011. We follow a methodology first proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier and measure banks' contribution to systemic risk by ΔCoVaR, which measures the contribution of bankto the financial system VaR when bankis in a state of distress. We define the system’ as the set of Italian listed banks in the sample. First, we find that the information contained in ΔCoVaR is different from that contained in the VaR. Therefore, regulators should take it into account in order to monitor the systemic risk posed by banks. Second, recent policy debate has focused on the danger posed by large banks and on the need to curb their size. We find that size is indeed the main predictor of a bank contribution to systemic risk. However, in the post Lehman period, leverage is also an important predictor of systemic risk. Consequently, any financial regulation designed only to curb banks' size could not completely eliminate systemic risk because it is exactly in crisis times that leverage becomes relevant.

"Ray, M.; Nigel, L.C.S.; Tan, A.M.",Triple infection keratitis,"To analyze the demographics, risk factors, and clinical and microbiological characteristics of triple infection keratitis. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Five patients (five eyes) with triple infection keratitis were identified. METHODS: Eyes with polymicrobial keratitis were identified from January 2002 to December 2010. Only culture-positive cases and eyes infected by three different organisms were included. Demographics, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The size of the corneal infiltrate, presence of hypopyon, pre- and post-treatment best-corrected visual acuity, antibiotic regimen and sensitivity, types of isolated pathogens, duration of infection, and treatment outcomes.The mean age was 39 years (SD, 23.4 range, 21-74). Use of topical steroids was the commonest risk factor (80%). Multiple risk factors were identified in four eyes. The average size of corneal infiltrate was 23.5 mm (SD, 35.2 range, 2.08-85.5), and all eyes developed hypopyon. A total of 15 organisms belonging to 10 species (bacteria 7, fungi 3) were isolated. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were the most frequently isolated bacteria (n 3) and fungi (n 3), respectively. All patients had at least one type of fungal isolate. Infection resolved with medical treatment in four eyes and one eye had to be eviscerated as the patient developed panophthalmitis. The average time taken for infection to resolve was 30 days (SD, 19.3 range, 13-61).A high index of suspicion of polymicrobial keratitis should be made in patients with multiple and systemic risk factors. Use of topical steroid was the most common risk factor. Prolonged course of disease, relatively large infiltrate, and presence of hypopyon and fungal isolates are typical features of triple infection keratitis.",2014,2014-05-01,12,Eye & Contact Lens Science & Clinical Practice,"adult; aged; anti-bacterial agents; bacteria; eye infections, bacterial; eye infections, fungal; female; fungi; humans; keratitis; male; middle aged; retrospective studies; risk factors; steroids; young adult",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Ray, M.

Potential systemic spillovers cause the planner to reduce investment in the risky firm. The market, modeled as a representative agent, does not just ignore the externality and invest as if there were none. Instead, systemic risk increases the market’s investment in the systemically risky institution or industry, further increasing systemic risk. These additional welfare losses from distorted capital allocation, caused by the asset pricing effects of systemic risk, appear to be significant.introduce bailout of the financial industry and find it has a beneficial direct effect and a distortion effect.

Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a local and painless antimicrobial treatment that can be applied in periodontal treatment without systemic risks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential improvement of aPDT on clinical and metabolic effects in patients with typediabetes mellitus in conjunction with nonsurgical periodontal treatment plus doxycycline. Thirty patients with typediabetes and diagnosis of chronic periodontitis were treated with scaling and root planning (SRP 15) or SRP plus phenothiazine chloride photosensitizer-induced aPDT (SRP aPDT,15). Patients of both groups took doxycycline (100 mg day) forweeks and plaque index, bleeding on probe (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), suppuration, clinical attachment level (CAL), and glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) were measured at baseline andmonths after therapy. An improvement in clinical parameters such as PPD, CAL, S, and BOP between groups was observed but without statistical significance (p 0.05).

"Chen, C.; Iyengar, G.; Moallemi, C.C.",An axiomatic approach to systemic risk,"Systemic risk refers to the risk of collapse of an entire complex system as a result of the actions taken by the individual component entities or agents that comprise the system. Systemic risk is an issue of great concern in modern financial markets as well as, more broadly, in the management of complex business and engineering systems. We propose an axiomatic framework for the measurement and management of systemic risk based on the simultaneous analysis of outcomes across agents in the system and over scenarios of nature. Our framework defines a broad class of systemic risk measures that accomodate a rich set of regulatory preferences. This general class of systemic risk measures captures many specific measures of systemic risk that have recently been proposed as special cases and highlights their implicit assumptions. Moreover, the systemic risk measures that satisfy our conditions yield decentralized decompositions i.e., the systemic risk can be decomposed into risk due to individual agents. Furthermore, one can associate a shadow price for systemic risk to each agent that correctly accounts for the externalities of the agent's individual decision making on the entire system.

NASH is a progressive liver disease that increases the risk of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Interestingly, the global health risk of NAFLD is not confined to the liver. Compared with those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD exhibit not only increased liver-related complications and liver-related mortality but also increased risk of developing typediabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, increased risk of post-operative complications after major liver surgery, and increased risk of developing certain malignancies, including primary liver cancer and colorectal cancer. In this review, we discuss the current evidence linking NAFLD with the risk of CVD in the setting of the more complex scenario of other hepatic and extra-hepatic complications that may occur during the natural course of NAFLD. Moreover, we provide a brief description of the putative biological mechanisms underlying such complications, particular emphasis being given to CVD. We conclude that NAFLD is a complex health problem with implications far beyond the liver. Hence, it may cause a significant global health burden and the assistance of patients with NAFLD impacts on the work of physicians from many different medical specialties.",2013,2013-01-01,105,Current Pharmaceutical Design,atherosclerosis; fatty liver; humans; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; risk factors,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Lonardo, A.

These risks can be estimated by using network metrics (as DebtRank) of the interbank liability network. With a simple agent based model we show that systemic risk in financial networks can be drastically reduced by increasing transparency, i.e. making the DebtRank of individual banks visible to others and by imposing a rule, that reduces interbank borrowing from systemically risky nodes. This scheme does not reduce the efficiency of the financial network, but fosters a more homogeneous risk-distribution within the system in a self-organized critical way. The reduction of systemic risk is due to a massive reduction of cascading failures in the transparent system.

After controlling for the link density, many topological properties display an abrupt change in 2008, providing a clear but unpredictable signature of the crisis. By contrast, if the heterogeneity of banks' connectivity is controlled for, the same properties show a gradual transition to the crisis, starting in 2005 and preceded by an even earlier period during which anomalous debt loops could have led to the underestimation of counter-party risk.

Despite various national recommendations, efforts to achieve international harmonization of specific evidence-based recommendations for best practice are still lacking. HYPOTHESIS: An international consensus study group should be able to develop recommendations on the use and monitoring of MoM bearings, preferably at the European level, through a multidisciplinary approach, by integrating the perspectives of various stakeholders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one experts representing three stakeholder groups and eight countries participated in this European consensus study, which consisted of a consensus meeting, subsequent structured discussion, and consensus voting.The current statement defines first of all benefits, local and systemic risks, as well as uncertain issues related to MoM bearings. Safety assessment after implantation of MoM comprises all patients. A closer follow-up is recommended for large head MoM36mm) and resurfacing. In these implants basic follow-up should consist of x-rays and metal ion measurement of cobalt in whole blood, performed with GF-AAS or ICP-MS. Clinical and or radiographic abnormality as well as elevated ion levels needs additional imaging (ultrasound, CT-scan and or MARS-MRI). Cobalt values less thanμgare probably devoid of clinical concern, the threshold value for clinical concern is expected to be within the range of 2-7 μg L. DISCUSSION: This is the first multinational, interdisciplinary, and multiprofessional approach for developing a recommendation for the use and monitoring of MoM bearings in total hip replacement. The current recommendations are in partial agreement with previous statements regarding the extent of follow-up and imaging techniques. They however differ from previous communications regarding measurement of metal ions and especially the investigated medium, technique, and eventual threshold levels.

A useful algorithm should fit for each type of prosthetic joint infection, even the most complicated situations. We present the outcome of 147 patients with prosthetic joint infections of the hip or the knee joint in an unselected population in clinical routine.MethodsBetween November 2006 and November 2009, 147 consecutive patients with prosthetic joint infections of the hip or knee were treated according to an algorithm based on the concept published by Zimmerli et al. in 2004. Causative organism, duration of infection, patient comorbidities, surgical treatment, antibiotic treatment, and outcome of treatment were analysed retrospectively. According to the criteria duration of infection, stability of prosthesis, local and systemic risk factors, and susceptibility of the causative pathogen, patients were treated either with debridement and retention or a long-interval two-stage procedure.A pathogen could be detected in 82.8of the patients, gram-positive cocci being most common. Twenty-seven patients were treated with debridement and retention and 120 were treated with a two-stage procedure. In 68 cases difficult-to-treat pathogens could be detected, a polymicrobial infection was found in 51 patients. Definitely free of infection were 71.6after a two-stage procedure, and 70.4after debridement and retention.Our data indicates that the applied algorithm is suitable to be applied as a day-to-day routine, and we confirmed that published from the literature can be reproduced in an inhomogeneous patient cohort.",2013,2013-07-13,60,International Orthopaedics,"adult; aged; aged, 80 and over; algorithms; anti-bacterial agents; arthroplasty, replacement, hip; arthroplasty, replacement, knee; cohort studies; debridement; disease management; female; hip joint; hip prosthesis; humans; knee joint; knee prosthesis; male; middle aged; prosthesis-related infections; reoperation; retrospective studies; treatment outcome",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Wimmer, M.D. (Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery, University of Bonn, 53105, Bonn, Germany); Randau, T.M.

One hundred patients suspected of keratitis were subjected to clinical examinations. A total of 115 corneal swabs from these cases were collected under aseptic conditions for bacteriological examinations.Culture of the corneal swabs revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.7%), and unclassified bacteria (13.9%). However, 52 swabs of infectious keratitis cases (45.2%) were negative to bacteria. Contact lens wearing (44.4%) was the most common risk factor among the examined patients, followed by corneal trauma (21.7%), ocular surface disease (11.3%), and corneal surgery (7%). No significant correlation was observed between systemic risk factor and clinical presentation.

METHODS: In 340 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease who underwent serial intravascular ultrasound imaging to evaluate the effects of anti atherosclerotic therapies acrossclinical trials, LMCA and epicardial disease progression was characterized. Relationships between changes in plaque burden with remodeling parameters and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (death, myocardial infarction, hospital stay for unstable angina, and coronary revascularization) were investigated.Plaque regression was observed in the LMCA segment, and progression was observed in adjacent epicardial segments (percent atheroma volume PAV -0.39 0.1% vs. 0.37 0.1%,0.001). Changes in LMCA lumen volume correlated strongly with changes in external elastic membrane (beta coefficient 0.91,0.001) and negatively with the change in PAV (beta coefficient -0.55,0.001).

The aim of the study was a long-term evaluation of local anatomical, as looking at systemic factors influencing specific complications and the failure rate of such plates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study covering an 11-year period, we reviewed the outcomes of angular stable plates of patients who had a segmental resection of the mandible and subsequent alloplastic reconstruction. Complications and failure rates were assessed and local (anatomical size and localization of resection) as well as systemic risk factors (age, sex, radiation therapy, smoking) evaluated.Altogether, 162 plates were reviewed. The overall complication rate was 28% (fractures8, loose screws7, dehiscences31) after an average time of 13 months. Cumulative survival rates of 73% after one, of 67% after 2, of 59% afterand of 40% after five years were observed. We found a significant correlation of increasing defect sizes to a rising complication and failure rate. Plate dehiscence occurred more often in defects including the midline (p 0.005). Though not statistically significant, the occurrence of plate fracture was associated with lateral mandibular defects (7 8,0.113). In smoking patients an earlier failure rate was seen.

"Hadoke, P.W.F.; Kipari, T.; Seckl, J.R.; Chapman, K.E.",Modulation of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as a strategy to reduce vascular inflammation,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which initial vascular damage leads to extensive macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration. Although acutely glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, chronic glucocorticoid excess worsens atherosclerosis, possibly by exacerbating systemic cardiovascular risk factors. However, glucocorticoid action within the lesion may reduce neointimal proliferation and inflammation. Glucocorticoid levels within cells do not necessarily reflect circulating levels due to pre-receptor metabolism by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs). 11β-HSD2 converts active glucocorticoids into inert 11-keto forms. 11β-HSD1 catalyses the reverse reaction, regenerating active glucocorticoids. 11β-HSD2-deficiency inhibition causes hypertension, whereas deficiency inhibition of 11β-HSD1 generates a cardioprotective lipid profile and improves glycemic control. Importantly, 11β-HSD1-deficiency inhibition is atheroprotective, whereas 11β-HSD2-deficiency accelerates atherosclerosis. These effects are largely independent of systemic risk factors, reflecting modulation of glucocorticoid action and inflammation within the vasculature. Here, we consider whether evidence linking the 11β-HSDs to vascular inflammation suggests these isozymes are potential therapeutic targets in vascular injury and atherosclerosis.",2013,2013-03-20,32,Current Atherosclerosis Reports,11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1; 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2; atherosclerosis; glucocorticoids; humans; neointima; vasculitis,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Hadoke, P.W.F.

Glycoxidation plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis, as pentosidine and Nε- carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), were detected in AD hallmarks, and in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the definitive role of AGEs in the neuropathology of AD is inconclusive. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the level of pentosidine in CSF of patients affected by neurological disorders, including probable AD, in order to assess the feasibility of AGEs detection in CSF and to explore pentosidine as a potential biomarker in AD. METHODS: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with AD (NINCDS ADRDA criteria) and different neurological disorders were enrolled. Diabetic patients were excluded. Pentosidine, CML, amyloid β1-42 were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Odetti modified method,and by sandwich ELISA respectively.Our data showed the presence of pentosidine in all CSF samples, a significant increase in CSF pentosidine levels with age (p 0.05) and a significant decreased concentration of pentosidine in four AD subjects (p 0.01), after normalization to CSF protein concentration.The study showed that AGEs concentration in CSF might benefit from age correction, at least for pentosidine, originally addressing a potential systemic age-dependent AGEs accumulation. The significant decrease of CSF pentosidine in AD, even inpatients, might conceive that different AGEs inform specific types of neurodegeneration, depending on oxidative stress levels, bloodbrain barrier permeability, brain localization and systemic risk factors.",2013,2013-04-06,7,Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine,"adult; aged; aged, 80 and over; alzheimer disease; amyloid beta-peptides; arginine; biomarkers; chromatography, high pressure liquid; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; female; humans; lysine; male; middle aged; peptide fragments",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3205 Medical Biochemistry and Metabolomics,"Monacelli, F.

"Lim, N.C.S.; Lim, D.K.A.; Ray, M.",Polymicrobial versus monomicrobial keratitis,"To compare the risk factors, clinical characteristics, microbiological profile, and treatment outcomes of polymicrobial versus monomicrobial keratitis. METHODS: In this retrospective comparative case series, eyes with polymicrobial and monomicrobial keratitis were identified from microbiological records at a tertiary academic referral center, from January 2002 to December 2010. Only culture positive cases were included. Eyes with infectious keratitis involving two or more pathogens were included in the polymicrobial group, whereas eyes infected solely by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were included in the monomicrobial group. Various parameters including demographics, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed.Twenty-one eyes each with polymicrobial and monomicrobial keratitis were included in this study. The mean age of polymicrobial patients was significantly higher than monomicrobials. Use of contact lens was the commonest predisposing factor in both groups. Systemic (23.8%) and multiple (33.3%) risk factors were involved in eyes with polymicrobial keratitis only. The mean size of corneal infiltrates and mean duration for resolvement of infection were significantly greater in the polymicrobial group. Medical treatment was successful only in 80.9% eyes with polymicrobial keratitis, whereas all monomicrobial keratitis patients responded to it. A total of 44 organisms belonging to 18 species (bacteria 13, fungi 5) were isolated from the polymicrobial group. P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans were the most frequently isolated bacteria (n 12) and fungi (n 5), respectively. In the polymicrobial group, gram-negative organisms were most sensitive to gentamicin (87.8%), followed by ciprofloxacin (78.7%), whereas gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to ciprofloxacin and cefazolin.A high index of suspicion of polymicrobial keratitis should be made in patients with multiple and systemic risk factors. Contact lens usage was the most common risk factor in both groups. Size of corneal infiltrate is a fairly reliable indicator for suspecting polymicrobial keratitis. Prolonged course of the disease and decreased antibiotic sensitivity were the other notable features of polymicrobial keratitis.",2013,2013-09-01,44,Eye & Contact Lens Science & Clinical Practice,"adolescent; adult; age factors; aged; anti-bacterial agents; bacteria; contact lenses; eye infections, bacterial; eye infections, fungal; female; fungi; humans; keratitis; male; microbial sensitivity tests; middle aged; retrospective studies; risk factors; young adult",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Lim, N.C.S.

METHODS: Patients with diabetes were recruited from a tertiary eye hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Total macular area covered by HEs (total HE area) and the distance from the foveal center to the nearest HE were measured in a semi-automated manner. Associations between HE parameters and diabetic complication risk factors were examined using multiple linear regression models.Of 593 participants (mean age 60.5-years old), 97 (16.4%) had HEs in at least one eye, due to diabetic maculopathy. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for inter- and intra-observer agreements were 0.982 and 0.999, respectively. Total HE area was positively associated with qualitative HE severity scale determined by photographic graders. The median of total HE area was 0.089 mm(2) (interquartile range, 0.027-0.246). The median distance between foveal center and the nearest HE was 791.1 μm (431.9-1385.4). After adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin, mean arterial pressure, diabetic retinopathy level, and use of lipid-lowering medication, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P 0.009), and triglyceride levels (P 0.036) were positively associated with total HE area. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with central involvement (P 0.023).Quantitative measurement of HEs in patients with diabetes is associated with lipid levels, and higher triglyceride levels are associated with a higher risk of central involvement.

The applicability of the ROP screening criteria to the Taiwanese population was also examined. METHODS: The study included 104 eyes from 54 ROP patients who had BW greater than 1500from 1981 to 2008. Demographic information, disease courses, ophthalmic outcomes, and possible systemic risk factors were recorded. The infants were divided into groups of mild and severe ROP for a risk factor analysis.The mean gestational age (GA) of the infants was 31 1.3 weeks, and the mean BW was 1675 249 g. Mild ROP regressed in 94 eyes (90%), and 10 eyes (10%) developed severe ROP. After various treatments, the regression rates for prethreshold or threshold ROP (n 8) and stageROP (n 2) were 100% and 50%, respectively. Forty-eight patients (85%) had at least three associated systemic risk factors. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with an intraventricular hemorrhage were found to have an increased chance of developing severe ROP, especially those with BW greater than 1500(p 0.015). There was also a significant association between patients who had severe ROP and an increased risk of having cerebral palsy (CP) at 1.5 years of age (p 0.013).

However, other systemic risk factors of OMJ remain unclear. Importantly, the possibility of risk classification based on the clinical characteristics of patients has not been explored. Here, we clarified risk factors of OMJ and evaluate the predictive accuracy of risk indices in osteoporosis patients. METHODS: We performed sub-analysis using a database developed for a retrospective cohort study in patients taking medications for osteoporosis at Kyoto University Hospital. Risk indices for OMJ were constructed using logistic regression analysis, and odds ratios (OR) for OMJ cases and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Potential risk factors included in the statistical analysis were age sex diabetes use of oral BPs, corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, antirheumatic drugs, and biologic agents and their interactions. Risk indices were calculated by the sum of potential risk factors of an individual patient multiplied by the regression coefficients. The discriminatory power of the risk indices was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.In analysis of all patients, oral BPs (OR: 4.98, 95% CIs: 1.94-12.75), age (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.06-1.60) and sex-chemotherapy interaction (OR: 11.70, 95% CI: 1.46-93.64) were significant risk factors of OMJ. Areas under the ROC curves of these risk indices provided moderate sensitivity or specificity regardless of group (0.683 to 0.718).Our data suggest that oral BP use, age, and sex-chemotherapy are predictors of OMJ in osteoporosis patients.

"Genco, R.J.; Borgnakke, W.S.",Risk factors for periodontal disease,"Risk factors play an important role in an individual's response to periodontal infection. Identification of these risk factors helps to target patients for prevention and treatment, with modification of risk factors critical to the control of periodontal disease. Shifts in our understanding of periodontal disease prevalence, and advances in scientific methodology and statistical analysis in the last few decades, have allowed identification of several major systemic risk factors for periodontal disease. The first change in our thinking was the understanding that periodontal disease is not universal, but that severe forms are found only in a portion of the adult population who show abnormal susceptibility. Analysis of risk factors and the ability to statistically adjust and stratify populations to eliminate the effects of confounding factors have allowed identification of independent risk factors. These independent but modifiable, risk factors for periodontal disease include lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. They also include diseases and unhealthy conditions such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, and low dietary calcium and vitamin D. These risk factors are modifiable and their management is a major component of the contemporary care of many periodontal patients. Genetic factors also play a role in periodontal disease and allow one to target individuals for prevention and early detection. The role of genetic factors in aggressive periodontitis is clear. However, although genetic factors (i.e., specific genes) are strongly suspected to have an association with chronic adult periodontitis, there is as yet no clear evidence for this in the general population. It is important to pursue efforts to identify genetic factors associated with chronic periodontitis because such factors have potential in identifying patients who have a high susceptibility for development of this disease. Many of the systemic risk factors for periodontal disease, such as smoking, diabetes and obesity, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, are relatively common and can be expected to affect most patients with periodontal disease seen in clinics and dental practices. Hence, risk factor identification and management has become a key component of care for periodontal patients.",2013,2013-04-11,715,Periodontology 2000,chronic disease; disease susceptibility; genetic predisposition to disease; humans; life style; periodontal diseases; risk factors,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Genco, R.J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of infants with severe ROP treated by diode laser in a tertiary center during the period April 1999 to November 2003 were reviewed. Treated infants were followed up for fundus examination, visual acuity assessment, and cycloplegic refraction. Data regarding ocular risk factors, like zones of ROP and the extent of extraretinal proliferations, and data regarding various systemic risk factors were collected. A minimum follow up ofmonths was needed for inclusion in the study of structural outcome. A minimum follow up of 24 months was needed for the study of visual and refractive outcomes. The outcomes measured were: rate of unfavorable structural outcome, unfavorable visual outcome (visual acuity 20 40), and high myopia (myopia diopters). The ocular and systemic risk factors were studied for their significance in the development of unfavorable outcomes.Two hundred seventy eyes of 148 infants were treated for severe ROP, out of which 20 eyes (7.4%) had unfavorable structural outcome. Visual data were available for 149 eyes of 81 infants, of which 70 eyes (47%) had unfavorable visual outcome. Refractive data were available for 131 eyes of 72 infants, and high myopia was present in 23 (17.6%) eyes. Zonedisease was the significant risk factor for unfavorable structural (P 0.0001), unfavorable visual outcome (P 0.03), and for high myopia (P 0.0001). Lower post-conceptional age at treatment was significant for unfavorable structural outcome (P 0.03) and high myopia (P 0.0001). Presence of sepsis (P 0.029) and extraretinal proliferation hours were significant for unfavorable structural outcome (P 0.002).

The purpose of this natural history study was to investigate the combined in-vivo effect of varying levels of systemic hypercholesterolemia and local endothelial shear stress (ESS) on subsequent plaque progression and histological composition. METHODS: Diabetic, hyperlipidemic swine with higher systemic total cholesterol (TC) (n 4) and relatively lower TC levels (n 5) underwent three-vessel intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at 3-5 consecutive time-points in-vivo. ESS was calculated serially using computational fluid dynamics. 3-D reconstructed coronary arteries were divided into 3mm-long segments (n 595), which were stratified according to higher vs. relatively lower TC and low1.2Pa) vs. higher local ESS1.2Pa). Arteries were harvested at 9months, and a subset of segments (n 114) underwent histopathologic analyses.Change of plaque volume (ΔPV) by IVUS over time was most pronounced in low-ESS segments from higher-TC animals. Notably, higher-ESS segments from higher-TC animals had greater ΔPV compared to low-ESS segments from lower-TC animals (p 0.001). The time-averaged ESS in segments that resulted in significant plaque increased with increasing TC levels (slope: 0.24Pa 100mg dl 0.80 0.01). At follow-up, low-ESS segments from higher-TC animals had the highest mRNA levels of lipoprotein receptors and inflammatory mediators and, consequently, the greatest lipid accumulation and inflammation.This study redefines the principle concept that ""low"" ESS promotes coronary plaque growth and vulnerability by demonstrating that: (i.) the pro-atherogenic threshold of low ESS is not uniform, but cholesterol-dependent and (ii.) the atherogenic effects of local low ESS are amplified, and the athero-protective effects of higher ESS may be outweighed, by increasing cholesterol levels. Intense hypercholesterolemia and very low ESS are synergistic in favoring rapid atheroma progression and high-risk composition.",2013,2013-10-11,29,International Journal of Cardiology,"animals; cohort studies; coronary artery disease; disease progression; endothelium, vascular; hypercholesterolemia; male; plaque, atherosclerotic; shear strength; swine",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Koskinas, K.C.

"Barone-Adesi, G.; Mancini, L.; Shefrin, H.",Systemic risk and sentiment,"Regulators charged with monitoring systemic risk need to focus on sentiment as well as narrowly defined measures of systemic risk. This chapter describes techniques for jointly monitoring the co-evolution of sentiment and systemic risk. To measure systemic risk, we use Marginal Expected Shortfall. To measure sentiment, we apply a behavioral extension of traditional pricing kernel theory, which we supplement with external proxies. We illustrate the technique by analyzing the dynamics of sentiment before, during, and after the global financial crisis which erupted in September 2008. Using stock and options data for theP 500 during the period 2002 2009, our analysis documents the statistical relationship between sentiment and systemic risk. Keywords Systemic risk, Marginal Expected Shortfall, Pricing Kernel, Overconfidence, Optimism JEL Codes: E61, G01, G02, G28 The report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC, 2011) emphasizes the importance of systemic risk and sentiment. These two concepts, and the relationship between them, are important for regulatory bodies such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) who, with the support of the Office of Financial Research (OFR), is charged with the responsibility for monitoring systemic risk throughout the financial system.

METHODS: Seven hundred and three patients (235 with nAMD and 468 with PCV) were included. Associated systemic conditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease, were investigated through an interview and questionnaire.The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in nAMD was significantly higher than that in PCV (P 0.001 and0.021, respectively, multivariate logistic regression analysis). Moreover, in diabetic patients with nAMD or PCV, the more severe form of diabetic retinopathy was more prevalent in nAMD cases than in PCV cases (P 0.006, multivariate logistic regression analysis).

We use a static model on financial institutions’ risk-taking behavior to quantify the systemic risk in the cross-sectional dimension in both regulated and unregulated systems. Although imposing a capital requirement can lower individual risk, it simultaneously enhances systemic linkage within the system. By using a proper systemic risk measure combining both individual risk and systemic linkage, we show that systemic risk in a regulated system can be higher than that in an unregulated system. In addition, we analyze a sufficient condition under which the systemic risk in a regulated system is always lower.",2013,2013-09-01,29,Journal of Financial Stability,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Zhou, C.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is a potential systemic risk of topical steroid use. Our aim was to review available data on the risk of HPA axis suppression associated with long-term topical steroid use and to distinguish between pathologic and physiologic adrenal suppression. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search for literature that evaluated the risk of HPA axis suppression associated with topical steroid use.Fifteen of sixteen clinical trials reviewed did not report any pathologic adrenal suppression. In the single clinical trial that reported pathologic adrenal suppression, the patients used twice the maximum recommended amount of clobetasol propionate continuously for as long as 18 months. Physiologic adrenal suppression was seen as early as 1-2 weeks after treatment with class I-IV topical corticosteroids. In about half of these patients, cortisol levels spontaneously returned to normal within a few weeks, despite continuous therapy. CONCLUSION: Even when adrenal suppression occurs, topical corticosteroids are unlikely to be associated with clinical signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression and are extremely safe as long as they are used within the current safety guidelines.",2013,2013-10-30,36,Journal of Dermatological Treatment,"administration, topical; adrenal insufficiency; aged; female; glucocorticoids; humans; hypothalamo-hypophyseal system; male; middle aged; pituitary-adrenal system; risk assessment",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Levin, E.

"Loepfe, L.; Cabrales, A.; Sánchez, A.",Towards a proper assignment of systemic risk: the combined roles of network topology and shock characteristics,"The 2007-2008 financial crisis solidified the consensus among policymakers that a macro-prudential approach to regulation and supervision should be adopted. The currently preferred policy option is the regulation of capital requirements, with the main focus on combating procyclicality and on identifying the banks that have a high systemic importance, those that are ""too big to fail"". Here we argue that the concept of systemic risk should include the analysis of the system as a whole and we explore systematically the most important properties for policy purposes of networks topology on resistance to shocks. In a thorough study going from analytical models to empirical data, we show two sharp transitions from safe to risky regimes: 1) diversification becomes harmful with just a small fraction2%) of the shocks sampled from a fat tailed shock distributions and 2) when large shocks are present a critical link density exists where an effective giant cluster forms and most firms become vulnerable. This threshold depends on the network topology, especially on modularity. Firm size heterogeneity has important but diverse effects that are heavily dependent on shock characteristics. Similarly, degree heterogeneity increases vulnerability only when shocks are directed at the most connected firms. Furthermore, by studying the structure of the core of the transnational corporation network from real data, we show that its stability could be clearly increased by removing some of the links with highest centrality betweenness. Our provide a novel insight and arguments for policy makers to focus surveillance on the connections between firms, in addition to capital requirements directed at the nodes.",2013,2013-10-17,23,Plos One,"humans; models, theoretical; neural networks, computer; risk","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment","Loepfe, L.

"Beck, U.",Why class’ is too soft a category to capture the explosiveness of social inequality,"We can distinguish four positions on the continuing, or maybe even increasing, relevance of the category of class at the beginning of the twenty-first century depending on the extent to which they accord central importance to (1) the reproduction or (2) the transformation of social classes with regard to (3) the distribution of goods without bads or (4) the distribution of goods and bads. One could say that Dean Curran introduces the concept of 'risk-class' to radicalize the class distribution of risk and charts who will able to occupy areas less exposed to risk and who will have little choice but to occupy areas that are exposed to the brunt of the fact of the risk society. As he mentioned it is important to note that this social structuring of the distribution of bads will be affected not only by class, but also by other forms of social structuration of disadvantage, such as gender and race. In order to demonstrate that the distribution of bads is currently exacerbating class differences in life chances, however, Curran concentrates exclusively on phenomena of individual risks. In the process, he overlooks the problem of systemic risks in relation of the state, science, new corporate roles, management the mass media, law, mobile capital and social movements at the same time, his conceptual frame of reference does not really thematize the interdependence between individual and systemic risks. Those who reduce the problematic of risk to that of the life chances of individuals are unable to grasp the conflicting social and political logics of risk and class conflicts.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional antidiabetic pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control). Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum glucose level 180 mg dL on occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled.The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control. Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-peptide ratio (I C) 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas metformin and or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS. In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age 60 years (P .0002),C 0.175 (P .0016), and average glucose level 180 mg dL (P .0236). Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age 60 years (P .0008),C 0.175 (P .0002), high systemic risk (P .0173) and average glucose level 180 mg dL (P .0249).C 0.175 was the only significant (P .0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration.A glargine-plus-aspart intensive insulin regimen did not improve ALL outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia.

For the majority of patients, calciphylaxis means a massive reduction in quality of life and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We still know little about the concert of local and systemic risk factors and underlying causes that finally lead to the development of calciphylaxis. Recent work from Asia points towards persistent uncertainties in the diagnosis and management of the disease which the nephrology community has to address by establishing standards in both diagnosis as well as treatment strategies. Hayashi et al. have published from a Japanese survey in which the authors collected data from calciphylaxis patients and compared clinical and laboratory data with those of control subjects. This innovative approach allowed the authors to calculate relative risks for various parameters in terms of calciphylaxis development. While uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism seemingly plays a secondary role, vitaminantagonist usage proved to be of particular importance. Survey as well as registry data may help to close the gap in our knowledge about calciphylaxis which may ultimately result in improved prevention, patient care and outcome.",2012,2012-02-17,54,Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,"anticoagulants; calciphylaxis; female; humans; kidney failure, chronic; male; renal dialysis; serum albumin; warfarin",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Brandenburg, V.M.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that endogenous glucocorticoids influence neointimal proliferation this may be mediated by effects on systemic risk factors or locally in vessels and modulated by either adrenal secretion or enzymes expressed in vessels that mediate local inactivation 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (11β-HSD2) in endothelium or regeneration 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type(11β-HSD1) in smooth muscle of glucocorticoids. Femoral artery wire angioplasty was conducted in C57BL 6J, Apo-E(- -), 11β-HSD1(- -), Apo-E, 11β-HSD1(- -) (double knockout), and 11β-HSD2(- -) mice after glucocorticoid administration, adrenalectomy, glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, or selective 11β-HSD1 inhibition. In C57BL 6J mice, neointimal proliferation was reduced by systemic or local glucocorticoid administration, unaffected by adrenalectomy, reduced by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone, and increased by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486. 11β-HSD2 deletion had no effect on neointimal proliferation, with or without eplerenone. 11β-HSD1 inhibition or deletion had no effect in chow-fed C57BL 6J mice but reduced neointimal proliferation in Apo-E(- -) mice on Western diet. Reductions in neointimal size were accompanied by reduced macrophage and increased collagen content. We conclude that pharmacological administration of glucocorticoid receptor agonists or of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may be useful in reducing neointimal proliferation. Endogenous corticosteroids induce beneficial glucocorticoid receptor activation and adverse mineralocorticoid receptor activation. However, manipulation of glucocorticoid metabolism has beneficial effects only in mice with exaggerated systemic risk factors, suggesting effects mediated primarily in liver and adipose rather than intravascular glucocorticoid signaling.

HYPOTHESIS: Infiltrative proliferation and satellite nodules are prognostic factors for local and systemic aggressiveness. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 105 patients under curative treatment, resection quality was assessed on UICC criteria (R0 R1) and on a modified version (R0M R1M) taking account of proliferation contours and satellite nodules for narrow margins1mm). Uni- and multi-variate analysis was performed, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared on log-rank.Mean 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was 0.64 0.52-0.76 after R1 surgery, 0.9 0.85-0.95 after R0, 0.64 0.519-0.751 after R1M and 0.92 0.87-0.96 after R0M. Resection type according toclassification correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) (P 0.028), but not with metastasis-free survival (MFS) (P 0.156). Resection type according to RM classification correlated with DFS and MFS. Multivariate analysis disclosed correlations between LRFS rate and RM resection type (HR 6.77 1.78-25.7P 0.005), DFS rate and RM resection type (HR 2.83 1.47-5.43P 0.001) and grade (HR 3.17 1.38-7.27P 0.003), and MFS and grade (HR 3.96 1.50-10.5P 0.006). DISCUSSION: The microscopic aspect of the proliferation contours and presence of satellite nodules were confirmed as prognostic factors for local and systemic aggressiveness. They impact both disease-free survival and metastasis-free survival in case of margins less than 1mm. Their systematic consideration may help identify patients with elevated systemic risk.

"Nadarajah, S.; Kon, C.; Rassam, S.",Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with the aid of an expanding gas bubble and risk factors,"PURPOSE: To assess the visual outcome after massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage managed by early controlled drainage using the aid of an intravitreal expanding gas bubble (100% perfluoropropane). The ocular and systemic risk factors were also reviewed. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively from patients with massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage who were treated in Worthing and Southlands National Health Service Trust between January 2003 and December 2008.The study included 10 patients (5 women andmen) with a mean age of 73.9 years (range, 54-84 years). All patients underwent early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage using 100% perfluoropropane as a tamponade. The mean interval of drainage from the onset was 3.5 days (range, 1-10 days). Anatomical restoration of ocular structures was achieved inpatients, with good final visual outcome at meanmonths (range, 6-14 months). The remaining three patients had poor visual outcome because of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The most common risk factor in this case series was glaucoma, which was seen in five patients. Arteriosclerosis was the only risk factor in two patients. CONCLUSION: Early controlled drainage of massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage with 100% perfluoropropane tamponade may help in achieving a good visual outcome. The use of 100% perfluoropropane has the advantage of maintaining positive pressure while facilitating controlled drainage of the hemorrhage as the clot lyses.

Diabetic retinopathy has a remarkable impact on public health and on the quality of life of diabetic patients and thus requires special consideration. The first line of treatment remains the management of systemic risk factors but is often insufficient in controlling DME and currently, laser retinal photocoagulation is considered the standard of care. However, laser treatment reduces the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50% without guaranteeing remarkable effects on visual improvement. For these reasons, new strategies in the treatment of DME have been studied, in particular the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. VEGF is a pluripotent growth factor that acts as a vasopermeability factor and an endothelial cell mitogen.

The purpose of this study was to determine the presentation, systemic and local predisposing factors, management challenges and outcome in south-eastern Nigeria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 28 out of 34 consecutive male patients with complete case notes seen in two centres (the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital and St Mary's Hospital) between January 1995 and December 2008. Operating theatre registers and urology ward admission registers were used to identify patients.The mean patient age was 48.3 years (range 2866 years), with a peak age incidence of 5059 years. The majority of patients were farmers, manual labourers and artisans. The site of gangrene was scrotal in 22 patients (78.6%), penoscrotal in(10.7%), abdominoscrotal in(7.1%) and scroto-perianal in(3.6%). The mean interval between onset of symptoms and presentation was 7.2 days (range- 14 days). Systemic predisposing factors identified were diabetes mellitus inpatients (21.4%), filariasis in(7.2%), congestive cardiac failure in(3.6%) and HIV infection in(3.6%). In 18 patients (64.3%) no systemic factor was identified. Local predisposing factors identified were chronic scrotal skin itching in 16 patients (57.1%), scrotal thorn injury in(7.1%) and urethral catheterisation in(7.1%). Scrotal carbuncle and scrotal surgery each accounted forpatients (7.1%), and zipper injury and ischiorectal abscess occurred inpatient each (3.6%). No local predisposing factor was identified inpatient (3.6%). The common clinical features were fever, scrotal swelling pain, and later a malodorous painless wound. Treatment involved fluid administration, correction of electrolyte imbalance, antibiotics, debridement and daily wound inspection dressing with hydrogen peroxide soaks and sodium hypochlorite. The mean duration of hospital stay was 37.1.days (range 2184 days). One patient died (3.6%). CONCLUSION: Fournier's gangrene is a challenging surgical problem, with significant morbidity. Diabetes mellitus is a significant systemic risk factor. In the majority of our cases, no systemic predisposing factor was identified. Local risk factors, especially chronic scrotal itching, were contributory.

"Faridi, O.; Park, S.C.; Liebmann, J.M.; Ritch, R.",Glaucoma and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome,"Glaucoma is increasingly recognized as a manifestation of both ocular and systemic risk factors. A number of disorders associated with reduced blood flow and ischaemia, collectively termed vascular risk factors, such as migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, atrial fibrillation and reduced nocturnal blood pressure, lead to decreased ocular perfusion pressure. During sleep, alterations occur in cardiovascular physiology that are balanced by autoregulation to maintain homeostasis. However, in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the normal physiological balance is upset. A potentially modifiable risk factor, OSA has been increasingly associated with glaucoma independent of intraocular pressure. OSA may alter blood flow to the optic nerve head and, in combination with other predisposing factors, lead to decreased ocular perfusion pressure. This in turn may directly affect the optic nerve or it may indirectly increase its susceptibility to other insults. The purpose of this review is to shed light on the association between OSA and glaucoma.",2012,2012-04-24,66,Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"glaucoma; humans; intraocular pressure; sleep apnea, obstructive",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3208 Medical Physiology; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Faridi, O.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pooled analysis using individual participant data from population-based studies around the world was performed. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all population-based studies in general populations or individuals with diabetes who had ascertained DR from retinal photographs. Studies provided data for DR end points, including any DR, proliferative DR, diabetic macular edema, and VTDR, and also major systemic risk factors. Pooled prevalence estimates were directly age-standardized to the 2010 World Diabetes Population aged 20-79 years.A total of 35 studies (1980-2008) provided data from 22,896 individuals with diabetes. The overall prevalence was 34.6% (95% CI 34.5-34.8) for any DR, 6.96% (6.87-7.04) for proliferative DR, 6.81% (6.74-6.89) for diabetic macular edema, and 10.2% (10.1-10.3) for VTDR. All DR prevalence end points increased with diabetes duration, hemoglobin A(1c), and blood pressure levels and were higher in people with typecompared with typediabetes.There are approximately 93 million people with DR, 17 million with proliferative DR, 21 million with diabetic macular edema, and 28 million with VTDR worldwide. Longer diabetes duration and poorer glycemic and blood pressure control are strongly associated with DR.

In this paper,systemic risk is defined as the conditional probability of a systemic banking crisis and this conditional probability is modeled in a fixed effect binary response model framework. The model structure is dynamic and is designed for monitoring as the systemic risk forecasts only depend on data that are available in real time. Several risk factors are identified and it is hereby shown that the level of systemic risk contains a predictable component which varies through time. Furthermore, it is shown how the systemic risk forecasts map into crisis signals and how policy thresholds are derived in this framework.

In this review, we describe our current knowledge on the role of Nuclear Receptors in atherosclerosis, which is a multifactorial disease of the vessel wall. Various cell types are involved in this chronic inflammatory pathology in which multiple cellular processes and numerous genes are dysregulated. Systemic risk factors for atherosclerosis are among others adverse blood lipid profiles, enhanced circulating cytokine levels, as well as increased blood pressure. Since many Nuclear Receptors modulate lipid profiles or regulate blood pressure they indirectly affect atherosclerosis. In the present review, we focus on the functional involvement of Nuclear Receptors within the atherosclerotic vessel wall, more specifically on their modulation of cellular functions in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages.

S: To estimate prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment and to describe its relationship with demographic and systemic risk factors including diagnosed diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized population. In 1999-2002 and 2005-2008, 9471 and 10,480 participants aged 20 years or older received questionnaires, laboratory tests, and physical examinations. Visual acuity of less than 20 40 aided by autorefractor was classified as nonrefractive visual impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Nonrefractive visual impairment.Weighted prevalence of nonrefractive visual impairment increased 21% among US adults aged 20 years and older from 1.4% in 1999-2002 to 1.7% in 2005-2008 (P .03) and increased 40% among non-Hispanic whites aged 20-39 years from 0.5% to 0.7% (P .008). In multivariable analyses, statistically significant risk factors for nonrefractive visual impairment in 1999-2002 included age (per year odds ratio OR1.07 95% CI, 1.05-1.09), poverty (OR, 2.18 95% CI, 1.31-3.64), lack of insurance (OR, 1.85 95% CI, 1.16-2.95), and diabetes with 10 or more years since diagnosis (OR, 1.93 95% CI, 1.15-3.25).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included type II diabetes mellitus subjects who were enrolled from a cross-sectional study. Participants underwent biochemical testing and comprehensive ocular examination including stereo fundus photography. The VI was defined based on the World Health Organization criteria.The prevalence of VI was 4% in the cohort. The risk factors associated with the presence of VI included a female gender, age greater than 60 years, low socio-economic status, hypertension, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, neuropathy, use of insulin and alcohol. Various ocular risk factors are nuclear sclerosis, subjects who have undergone cataract surgery, myopia and sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR). After adjusting for the factors using stepwise logistic regression analysis, hypertension, use of alcohol, post-cataract surgery and myopia were not risk factors.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with visual field tests during follow-up were included. Progression was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis, defined as the sameor more visual field locations with a slope more negative than -1.0 dB year at5%, onconsecutive tests. Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model.A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7 10.9 years mean follow-up, 40.6 12 months) were analyzed. Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine (mean rates of progression, -0.38 0.9 vs 0.02 0.7 dB y,.01). In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates, older age (hazard ratio HR 1.41 decade older, 95% confidence interval CI 1.05 to 1.90,.022), use of systemic antihypertensives (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.87,.005), and mean ocular perfusion pressure (HR 1.21 mm Hg lower, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.31,.001) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55,.001).While randomization to brimonidine 0.2% was protective compared to timolol 0.5%, lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study. This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between thetreatment arms.

A total of 300 diabetic patients were recruited for the study for each of them a value for the macular edema index was obtained using the HRT II. Patients' age, gender, duration and type of diabetes mellitus, latest HbA1c result and presence or absence of co-morbid factors (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, nephropathy) were recorded together with the stage of diabetic retinopathy. These were correlated with DME. Out of 300 patients, HRT defined macula edema was seen in 68 patients (22.6%). There is a wider and higher range (95% percentile) of macula edema index in the severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group. Independent samplestest showed significant difference between the severe NPDR group and no DR group (p 0.001), mild NPDR group (p 0.05) and moderate NPDR group (p 0.05). A higher macula edema index was also found to have a low degree of correlation with more advanced stages of retinopathy (r 0.310 0.001).

"Barone-Adesi, G.; Mancini, L.; Shefrin, H.","Sentiment, asset prices, and systemic risk","Regulators charged with monitoring systemic risk need to focus on sentiment as well as narrowly defined measures of systemic risk. This chapter describes techniques for jointly monitoring the co-evolution of sentiment and systemic risk. To measure systemic risk, we use Marginal Expected Shortfall. To measure sentiment, we apply a behavioral extension of traditional pricing kernel theory, which we supplement with external proxies. We illustrate the technique by analyzing the dynamics of sentiment before, during, and after the global financial crisis which erupted in September 2008. Using stock and options data for theP 500 during the period 2002 2009, our analysis documents the statistical relationship between sentiment and systemic risk.",2012,2012-01-01,14,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Barone-Adesi, G.

"Arinaminpathy, N.; Kapadia, S.; May, R.M.",Size and complexity in model financial systems,"The global financial crisis has precipitated an increasing appreciation of the need for a systemic perspective toward financial stability. For example: What role do large banks play in systemic risk How should capital adequacy standards recognize this role How is stability shaped by concentration and diversification in the financial system We explore these questions using a deliberately simplified, dynamic model of a banking system that combines three different channels for direct transmission of contagion from one bank to another: liquidity hoarding, asset price contagion, and the propagation of defaults via counterparty credit risk. Importantly, we also introduce a mechanism for capturing how swings in ""confidence"" in the system may contribute to instability. Our highlight that the importance of relatively large, well-connected banks in system stability scales more than proportionately with their size: the impact of their collapse arises not only from their connectivity, but also from their effect on confidence in the system. Imposing tougher capital requirements on larger banks than smaller ones can thus enhance the resilience of the system. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in more concentrated systems, and continue to apply, even when allowing for potential diversification benefits that may be realized by larger banks. We discuss some tentative implications for policy, as well as conceptual analogies in ecosystem stability and in the control of infectious diseases.",2012,2012-08-22,113,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"economics; financial management; models, economic","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Arinaminpathy, N.

Currently, there is a lack of consensus among experts on the nature of these associations and confusion among health care providers and the public on how to interpret this rapidly growing body of science. This article overviews the current evidence linking periodontal diseases to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, preterm low birth weight babies, respiratory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was taken from systematic reviews, clinical trials, and mechanistic studies retrieved in searches of the PubMed electronic database. The available data provide the basis for applied practical clinical recommendations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence is summarized and critically reviewed from systematic reviews, primary clinical trials, and mechanistic studiesSurrogate markers for chronic periodontitis, such as tooth loss, show relatively consistent but weak associations with multiple systemic conditions. Despite biological plausibility, shorter-term interventional trials have generally not supported unambiguous cause-and-effect relationships. Nevertheless, the effective treatment of periodontal infections is important to achieve oral health goals, as well as to reduce the systemic risks of chronic local inflammation and bacteremias. Inflammatory periodontal diseases exhibit an association with multiple systemic conditions. With pregnancy as a possible exception, the local and systemic effects of periodontal infections and inflammation are usually exerted for many years, typically among those who are middle-aged or older. It follows that numerous epidemiological associations linking chronic periodontitis to age-associated and biologically complex conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, respiratory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers, erectile dysfunction, kidney disease and dementia, have been reported. In the coming years, it seems likely that additional associations will be reported, despite adjustments for known genetic, behavioral and environmental confounders. Determining cause-and-effect mechanisms is more complicated, especially in circumstances where systemic effects may be subtle. Currently, however, there is a lack of consensus among experts on the nature of these associations and confusion among health care providers and the public on how to interpret this rapidly growing body of science.

In this study we addressed the molecular and cellular effects of elevated and suppressed levels of circulating cholesterol on the normal prostate. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was performed using DNA microarray data from two experimental formats: (1) ventral prostate from male mice with chronically elevated circulating cholesterol and (2) human prostate cells exposed acutely to cholesterol depletion. A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels.

The smallest, sickest infants develop the most severe forms of zoneROP. Such eyes may not be successfully treated by near confluent laser to the avascular retina (current standard of care). With an understanding of ROP pathogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGF) are being given only when VEGF is elevated in retina and vitreous. Careful screening allows proper timing of administration. Ideal dose (perhaps different for mild and severe cases) and drug (interrupting only pathologic neovascularization and not normal angiogenesis) remain unproven. The author discusses controversial use of anti-VEGF with documented efficacy, observed local complications, and potential systemic toxicities (none observed in six years) to allow retention of vision for severe zoneROP. The benefits have been demonstrated, however, local and systemic risks in these developing premature infants must be carefully studied (both short and long term).",2012,2012-10-15,46,Early Human Development,"antibodies, monoclonal, humanized; aptamers, nucleotide; bevacizumab; humans; infant; infant, newborn; infant, premature; ranibizumab; receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor; recombinant fusion proteins; retinopathy of prematurity; vascular endothelial growth factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Mintz-Hittner, H.A.

This has lead to the emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important discovery is that search engine traffic (i.e., the number of requests submitted by users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful examples include unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that daily trading volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with daily volumes of queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of many users.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a monocentric retrospective study from January 2005 to January 2011, identifying and collecting data from inpatients admitted for severe documented bacterial keratitis.We found 268 unilateral corneal ulcers. At least one local or systemic risk factor was identified in 255 268 patients (95%). The leading risk factor was contact lens wear (129 268), followed by underlying corneal disease (50 268) and prior corneal surgery (47 268). Initial and final visual acuities were 0.06 and 0.2 (1.20 and 0.72 LogMAR) respectively. Contact lens wear was associated with better prognosis and shorter hospitalization (P 0.05). Corneal healing was obtained in 255 268 patients (95%), with adjuvant surgery for 33 patients. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Gram cocci, more commonly associated with degenerative keratopathy or prior corneal surgery, and Gram- bacilli, more commonly associated with contact lenses (P 0.05). Both demonstrated a similar prognosis. CONCLUSION: Specific risk factors should be investigated in cases of severe bacterial keratitis.

RPE-derived matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-14, and basigin (BSG) are major enzymes involved in the maintenance of ECM turnover. Hypertension (HTN) is a systemic risk factor for AMD. It has previously been reported that angiotensin II (Ang II), one of the most important hormones associated with HTN, increases MMP-2 activity and its key regulator, MMP-14, in RPE, inducing breakdown of the RPE basement membrane, which may lead to progression of sub-RPE deposits. Ang II exerts most of its actions by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Herein is explored the MAPK signaling pathway as a potential key intracellular modulator of Ang II-induced increase in MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and BSG protein expression. It was observed that Ang II stimulates phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK in RPE cells and ERK p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in mice. These effects were mediated by Ang II typereceptors. Blockade of ERK or p38 MAPK abrogated the increase in MMP-2 activity and MMP-14 and BSG proteins in ARPE-19 cells. A better understanding of the molecular events by which Ang II induces ECM dysregulation is of critical importance to further define its contribution to the progression of sub-RPE deposits in AMD patients with HTN.",2011,2011-06-01,56,American Journal of Pathology,"angiotensin ii; animals; basigin; blood pressure; cell line; enzyme activation; gene silencing; hypertension; jnk mitogen-activated protein kinases; macular degeneration; map kinase signaling system; matrix metalloproteinase 14; matrix metalloproteinase 2; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases; phosphorylation; receptor, angiotensin, type 1; renin; retinal pigment epithelium; systole; up-regulation",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Pons, M.

The clinical picture is typically characterized by very painful skin lesions and ulcerations following calcification and occlusion of small cutaneous arterioles. CUA is life-threatening due to infections and concomitant cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: We performed a literature search for the terms calciphylaxis and calcific uremic arteriolopathy and summarized current state-of-the-art knowledge about pathophysiology, clinical picture, course of the disease, as well as treatment options. We have filled out the literature data with our personal treatment experiences.A combination of various local and systemic risk factors are necessary to cause the development of calciphylaxis. This pathophysiological cascade is still incompletely understood. Patients with advanced CKD and dialysis patients are especially at risk to develop CUA. Regarding therapy, no randomized prospective trials are available, and treatment is rather based on pathophysiological considerations as well as on evidence derived from case reports or case series. Therapy focuses on optimized dialysis treatment, control of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder parameters, experimental anticalcification strategies and wound care. CONCLUSION: Facing the still deleterious outcome of patients with calciphylaxis, further studies on prophylaxis as well as treatment are urgently needed.

"Kuroda, T.",Cellular kinetics of neuroblastoma and the role of surgery,"Neuroblastoma is known for its peculiar cellular kinetics, which has provoked some controversy regarding surgical treatment. Highly sensitive exploration systems using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods have been developed to detect neuroblastoma cells. In our series of 49 patients with advanced neuroblastoma, circulating tumor cells (CTC) were detected by this system in 55.6% of the stagepatients who were examined, suggesting that the primary lesion may release tumor cells into the peripheral blood. The Kaplan Meier survival rate was significantly lower among the patients with CTC or chemotherapy-insensitive bone marrow micrometastasis, compared with those without detectable micrometastasis (33.8 vs. 87.5%,0.05). In contrast, a stagepatient with MYCN amplification exhibited drastic local relapse without systemic dissemination of the disease. Two patients were positive for CTC without an identifiable primary site. These observations indicate that the local growth of the primary tumor and tumor cell dissemination may be regulated by different molecular mechanisms in neuroblastomas. MYCN amplification seemed to be more closely associated with localized tumor growth but was minimally correlated with CTC positivity. High-risk neuroblastoma may include two separate subgroups characterized by different cellular kinetics: a local risk cohort and a systemic risk cohort. Surgical strategies for neuroblastoma should be determined with taking this cellular kinetics into consideration.",2011,2011-07-19,3,Pediatric Surgery International,child; humans; neoplasm micrometastasis; neuroblastoma,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"Kuroda, T.

Many proposals for financial reform address the need for systemic regulation--that is, regulation focused on the soundness of the whole financial system and not just that of individual institutions. In this paper, we study one particular problem faced by a systemic regulator: the tension between the distribution of assets that individual banks would like to hold and the distribution across banks that best supports system stability if greater weight is given to avoiding multiple bank failures. By diversifying its risks, a bank lowers its own probability of failure. However, if many banks diversify their risks in similar ways, then the probability of multiple failures can increase. As more banks fail simultaneously, the economic disruption tends to increase disproportionately. We show that, in model systems, the expected systemic cost of multiple failures can be largely explained by two global parameters of risk exposure and diversity, which can be assessed in terms of the risk exposures of individual actors. This observation hints at the possibility of regulatory intervention to promote systemic stability by incentivizing a more diverse diversification among banks. Such intervention offers the prospect of an additional lever in the armory of regulators, potentially allowing some combination of improved system stability and reduced need for additional capital.",2011,2011-07-18,127,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"algorithms; costs and cost analysis; economics; humans; income; models, economic; risk assessment; risk factors","35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Beale, N.

"Hayreh, S.S.",Management of ischemic optic neuropathies,"Ischemic optic neuropathies (IONs) consist primarily of two types: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION). AION comprises arteritic AION (A-AION: due to giant cell arteritis) and non-arteritic AION (NA-AION: due to other causes). PION consists of arteritic PION (A-PION: due to giant cell arteritis), non-arteritic PION (NA-PION: due to other causes), and surgical PION (a complication of several systemic surgical procedures). These five types of ION are distinct clinical entities etiologically, pathogenetically, clinically and from the management point of view. In the management of AION, the first crucial step with patients aged 50 and over is to identify immediately whether it is arteritic or not because A-AION is an ophthalmic emergency and requires urgent treatment with high-dose steroid therapy to prevent any further visual loss in one or both eyes. Patients with NA-AION, when treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy within firstweeks of onset, had significantly better visual outcome than untreated ones. Systemic risk factors, particularly nocturnal arterial hypotension, play major roles in the development of NA-AION management of them is essential in its prevention and management. NA-PION patients, when treated with high-dose systemic steroid therapy during the very early stages of the disease, showed significant improvement in visual acuity and visual fields, compared to untreated eyes. A-PION, like A-AION, requires urgent treatment with high-dose steroid therapy to prevent any further visual loss in one or both eyes.

"Zhu, Z.; Jiang, W.; Thompson, M.D.; McGinley, J.N.; Thompson, H.J.",Metformin as an energy restriction mimetic agent for breast cancer prevention,"This study examined whether metformin administration inhibited chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis in rats. In cancer prevention, metformin may act (1) indirectly through reducing systemic risk factors or (2) directly through AMPK-mediated signaling. To begin to delineate clinically relevant mechanisms for breast cancer prevention, metformin was also studied along with dietary energy restriction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mammary cancer was induced in female Sprague--Dawley rats (50 mg kg MNU, i.p.). Metformin was fed alone (AIN93G 0.05 to 1.0%w metformin) or combined with 40% dietary energy restriction. Plasma analytes (e.g., insulin, glucose, IGF-1) and protein expression (e.g., AMPK, mTOR, Akt) in mammary carcinomas and liver were evaluated. Additional studies included (1) aldehyde dehydrogenase flow cytometry, to gauge potential for cancer-initiated cells in mammary carcinomas to respond to metformin (2) cell culture, to understand dose response (0.02--20 mM) of different cancer cell line molecular subtypes to metformin and (3) analysis of a rat mammary epithelial cell microarray database, to examine expression of genes related to metformin pharmacokinetics (e.g., organic cation transporters) and pharmacodynamics (e.g., complexof electron transport).While a dosing regimen of 1.0% 0.25% metformin-reduced palpable mammary carcinoma incidence, multiplicity, and tumor burden and prolonged latency, lower doses of metformin failed to inhibit carcinogenesis despite effects on plasma insulin. Human breast cancer cell growth inhibition in response to metformin was only observed at high concentrations. Poor in vivo and in vitro response to metformin may be the result of pharmacokinetic (OCT-1 expression was low in rat mammary cells OCT-3 was downregulated in mammary carcinoma) and pharmacodynamic (complextranscripts were higher in mammary epithelial cells from carcinomas versus uninvolved gland) effects. In combination with dietary energy restriction, metformin offered protection against new tumor occurrence following release from combined treatment. Flow cytometry indicated the presence of cancer-initiated cells in mammary carcinomas.As a single agent, metformin possessed limited cancer inhibitory activity. However, metformin may be an effective component of multiagent interventions that target cancer-initiated cells. There is a clear need to identify the conditions under which metformin is likely to benefit prevention and control of breast cancer.",2011,2011-07-19,39,Journal of Carcinogenesis,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"Zhu, Z.

"Mohan, V.A.; Nithyanandam, S.; Idiculla, J.",Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin as risk factors for the occurrence and increasing severity of diabetic retinopathy,"AIM: To assess the influence of urinary microalbuminuria and hemoglobin concentration on the occurrence and severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR), clinically significant macular edema (CSME) and hard exudate formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study carried out over a period ofyears, typediabetic patients seeking ocular evaluation for DR were assessed for presence and severity of DR, presence of hard exudates and CSME. Retinal findings were correlated to severity of microalbuminuria, hemoglobin concentration and other systemic risk factors using linear regression analysis.Three hundred and six patients were included in the study. DR of any grade was seen in 132 (43%) patients, hard exudate formation in 93 306 (30.4%) patients, CSME in 50 306 (16.3%) patients and proliferative DR in 26 306 (8.5%) patients. Duration of diabetes (P 0.001), microalbuminuria (P 0.001) and low hemoglobin (P 0.001) were found to be highly significant risk factors for the development and increasing severity of DR as well as for CSME and hard exudate formation. CONCLUSION: Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin are strong predictors for DR, CSME and hard exudate formation in typediabetics even after correcting for duration of diabetes and other systemic risk factors. Although not directly involved in the pathogenesis, microalbuminuria can help in identifying patients at risk for more severe diabetic eye disease. Microalbuminuria warrants intensive monitoring of both retinal and renal status.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey utilising self-report data was administered to 327 regular illicit drug users in Sydney, Australia.Those who first committed violent crime prior to illicit drug use were found to have more serious offending patterns (greater frequency, arrest for more serious violence, earlier age of onset, and more weapon use). Being male, having a history of child abuse and greater severity of conduct disorder were independent predictors of committing violence before drug use. DISCUSSION ANDWhilst the nature of the data does not permit causativeit appears that the order of onset of illicit drug use and violent crime is associated with heterogeneous offending patterns. Early onset violence was associated with more severe violent crimes in later adulthood, whereas violence which proceeded drug use was more strongly linked to systemic risks. The findings have implications for early intervention among children with conduct disorder and also for using drug and alcohol treatment services to reduce specific risks associated with violence.",2011,2011-07-05,15,Drug and Alcohol Review,adolescent; adult; australia; conduct disorder; crime; criminals; cross-sectional studies; drug users; early medical intervention; female; humans; male; middle aged; risk factors; self report; sex factors; substance-related disorders; surveys and questionnaires; violence,44 Human Society; 4402 Criminology,"TOROK, M.

"Andersen, J.V.; Nowak, A.; Rotundo, G.; Parrott, L.; Martinez, S.",Price-Quakes shaking the world's stock exchanges,"Systemic risk has received much more awareness after the excessive risk taking by major financial instituations pushed the world's financial system into what many considered a state of near systemic failure in 2008. The IMF for example in its yearly 2009 Global Financial Stability Report acknowledged the lack of proper tools and research on the topic. Understanding how disruptions can propagate across financial markets is therefore of utmost importance. METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we use empirical data to show that the world's markets have a non-linear threshold response to events, consistent with the hypothesis that traders exhibit change blindness. Change blindness is the tendency of humans to ignore small changes and to react disproportionately to large events. As we show, this may be responsible for generating cascading events--pricequakes--in the world's markets. We propose a network model of the world's stock exchanges that predicts how an individual stock exchange should be priced in terms of the performance of the global market of exchanges, but with change blindness included in the pricing. The model has a direct correspondence to models of earth tectonic plate movements developed in physics to describe the slip-stick movement of blocks linked via spring forces. SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown how the price dynamics of the world's stock exchanges follows a dynamics of build-up and release of stress, similar to earthquakes. The nonlinear response allows us to classify price movements of a given stock index as either being generated internally, due to specific economic news for the country in question, or externally, by the ensemble of the world's stock exchanges reacting together like a complex system. The model may provide new insight into the origins and thereby also prevent systemic risks in the global financial network.",2011,2011-11-02,25,Plos One,internationality; investments,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","Andersen, J.V.

The authors studied the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive function. METHODS: The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study is a national longitudinal study of more than 30,000 African American and white adults 45 years or older. Data for tooth loss, cognitive function and potential confounding variables were available for 9,853 participants at the time of analysis. The authors used incremental linear regression modeling to investigate the cross-sectional association between self-reported tooth loss and cognitive function.In unadjusted analysis (mean learning followed by recall level of significance of .05), the loss of six to 16 teeth and the loss of more than 16 teeth were associated with poorer cognitive function compared with the loss of no teeth. Attenuated associations persisted after the authors adjusted for demographic and systemic risk factors. The full model, which was adjusted for socioeconomic status (SES), revealed no association between tooth loss and cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Tooth loss may be associated with cognitive function however, this association is mediated by age and SES. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tooth loss due to periodontal disease may be a marker for low SES, and the interplay of these factors with advanced age may confer risk of having poorer cognitive function.

However, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can control C5aR activation by generating C5a through its own C5 convertase-like enzymatic activity. In this paper, we show that P. gingivalis uses this mechanism to proactively and selectively inhibit TLR2-induced IL-12p70, whereas the same pathogen-instigated C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk upregulates other inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). In vivo, the ability of P. gingivalis to manipulate TLR2 activation via the C5a-C5aR axis allowed it to escape IL-12p70-dependent immune clearance and to cause inflammatory bone loss in a murine model of experimental periodontitis. In the latter regard, C5aR-deficient or TLR2-deficient mice were both resistant to periodontal bone loss, in stark contrast with wild-type control mice, which is consistent with the interdependent interactions of C5aR and TLR2 in P. gingivalis immune evasion and induction of bone-resorptive cytokines. In conclusion, P. gingivalis targets C5aR to promote its adaptive fitness and cause periodontal disease. Given the current availability of safe and effective C5aR antagonists, pharmacological blockade of C5aR could act therapeutically in human periodontitis and reduce associated systemic risks.",2011,2011-01-15,138,the Journal of Immunology,"alveolar bone loss; animals; disease models, animal; immune evasion; inflammation mediators; interleukin-10; interleukin-12; mice; mice, inbred balb c; mice, inbred c57bl; mice, knockout; myeloid differentiation factor 88; periodontitis; porphyromonas gingivalis; receptor cross-talk; receptor, anaphylatoxin c5a; signal transduction; toll-like receptor 2",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Liang, S.

Other reliable methods with lower side effects and shorter test duration are being investigated.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the nasal provocation test (NPT) and the basophil activation test (BAT) in the diagnosis of different subtypes of aspirin sensitivity. METHODS: Thirty aspirin sensitivity patients with cutaneous and respiratory manifestations underwent NPT and BAT with lysine-ASA. NPT result was interpreted as recommended in EAACI GA2LEN guidelines and receiver operating characteristic analysis of BAT was performed by using 15 NSAIDs tolerant volunteers as a control group.NPT was positive in 60% (18 30) of patients and BAT was positive in 76.7% (23 30) of patients. The incubation of basophils with 0.31 mg ml of lysine-aspirin and using 4.6% activated basophils gives the best predictive values to diagnose aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests yielded positive in 80% and 93.3% of aspirin-induced cutaneous and respiratory patterns. The agreement between NPT and BAT was 63.3%.NPT and BAT are beneficial to detect patients with aspirin sensitivity. The combination of both tests have additional diagnostic values less time-consuming than OPT and their complications are negligible. A reliable alternative method with minimum side effects is needed to diagnose aspirin sensitivity in suspected patients who have contraindications for OPT.,2011,2011-04-13,9,Allergologia Et Immunopathologia,"adolescent; adult; aged; anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroidal; aspirin; asthma, aspirin-induced; basophil degranulation test; female; humans; male; middle aged; nasal provocation tests; sensitivity and specificity; single-blind method; young adult",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Wismol, P.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PARTICIPANTS: 139 patients. METHODS: Retrospective collection of demographic, medical, surgical and postoperative data of all patients undergoing vitrectomy for diabetic eye disease at The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlation of the rates of persistent vitreous cavity haemorrhage and anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment.Sixty-eight of 155 (43.9%) eyes of 139 patients were on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy prior to surgery. At the time of surgery, 29 (42.6%) were on therapy. Eight of 29 (27.6%) patients had significant persistent vitreous cavity haemorrhage in the postoperative period, with four (13.8%) requiring secondary surgery. Thirty-nine (57.4%) patients had discontinued therapy prior to surgery. Among these, four (10.3%) had persistent bleeding, of which three (7.7%) required additional surgery. Six of 87 (6.9%) patients not on any anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy had persistent postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage, with none requiring further surgery. Patients on anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy at the time of surgery were more likely to experience persistent haemorrhage and subsequent reoperation (OR 4.8,0.0045 and OR 6.6,0.024, respectively). CONCLUSION: Perioperative continuation of anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment appears to increase the risk of persistent postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage and the necessity for vitreous cavity washout in this diabetic cohort. Appropriate preoperative cessation of treatment appeared to reduce this risk however, caution must be taken with regard to the systemic risk associated with cessation of therapy.",2011,2011-06-14,25,Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology,"adult; aged; aged, 80 and over; anticoagulants; diabetic retinopathy; female; humans; male; middle aged; platelet aggregation inhibitors; postoperative complications; reoperation; retrospective studies; risk factors; visual acuity; vitrectomy; vitreous hemorrhage; young adult",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Fabinyi, D.C.

AIMS: To study the association of various systemic risk factors with retinal hard exudates in typediabetic north Indian patients and to measure the incidence of dyslipidemia in them. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A tertiary-hospital-based cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational case-study which included 180 typediabetic patients (180 eyes) of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with clinically significant macular edema (CSME). In these patients the retinal hard exudates were graded on a central 500 fundus picture using modified Airlie House classification and divided into three groups of absent or minimal hard exudates (Group 1), hard exudates present (Group 2) and prominent hard exudates (Group 3). Their association with various risk factors, namely the age of onset of diabetes and its duration, gender, insulin therapy, and various systemic parameters like hypertension, blood hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum (s.) creatinine levels, 24-h proteinuria and complete lipid profile including total s. cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and s. triglyceride (TG) was studied. The incidence of dyslipidemia was also calculated among these groups of patients. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ANOVA test, linear regression analysis and Spearman's correlation test.On univariate analysis, the retinal hard exudates were significantly associated with s. creatinine (P 0.016), systolic blood pressure (P 0.014), s. cholesterol (P 0.001), s. LDL (P 0.008) and s. TG (P 0.013) levels. While on linear regression analysis, s. cholesterol (P 0.001) and s. LDL cholesterol (P 0.028) were found to be independent risk factors affecting the density of retinal hard exudates. On Spearman's correlation test, the retinal hard exudates showed a significant positive correlation with systolic blood pressure (P 0.019), s. cholesterol (P 0.001), LDL (P 0.002) and TG (P 0.014) levels. The incidence of dyslipidemia varied from as high as nearly 70% among patients of Groupcompared to as low as 18% among Grouppatients.

"Merante, D.; Menchini, F.; Truitt, K.E.; Bandello, F.M.",Diabetic macular edema,"Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of visual loss and legal blindness in people with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of DME is complex and multifactorial, and involves both local and systemic risk factors that may alter the blood-retina barrier and allow leakage of protein and fluid into the macula. Recently, in addition to well known risk factors, the use of thiazolidinediones (glitazones) has been related to the development and worsening of DME. This review is based on available literature derived from EMBASE and MEDLINE, from 1950 to May 2010, and focuses on the potential correlations between DME and current available therapies for typeanddiabetes.This review reveals that the current literature, with the potential exception of glitazones, is not sufficient for a definite statement on the association between DME and currently available diabetic therapies. In fact, among antidiabetic agents, the class of glitazones appears the only one to be potentially associated with DME. Furthermore, adequately powered, prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the exact causal association between glitazones and DME and to exclude the role of other confounding factors potentially able to induce or exacerbate macular edema. Improvement of the quality and reporting in postmarketing surveillance and the use of the dechallenge and rechallenge’ approach in case of suspicious cause effect drug relationship of DME are highly encouraged.",2010,2010-08-01,15,Drug Safety,"animals; diabetes mellitus, type 1; diabetes mellitus, type 2; humans; macular edema; medline; thiazolidinediones",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Merante, D.

METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on patients who underwent cataract surgery in a public hospital over an 11-year period. An ocular infection database was used to report endophthalmitis occurrences and to collect the clinical features. Qualitative variables are described with their frequency distribution and qualitative variables, with the mean and the standard deviation.From January 1999 to December 2009, 15.173 patients underwent cataract surgery. A total of 43 patients suffered from postoperative endophthalmitis, giving an overall infection rate of 0.28% (95% CI: 0.20-0.36%).

"Gerrard, R.; Tsanakas, A.",Failure probability under parameter uncertainty,"In many problems of risk analysis, failure is equivalent to the event of a random risk factor exceeding a given threshold. Failure probabilities can be controlled if a decisionmaker is able to set the threshold at an appropriate level. This abstract situation applies, for example, to environmental risks with infrastructure controls to supply chain risks with inventory controls and to insurance solvency risks with capital controls. However, uncertainty around the distribution of the risk factor implies that parameter error will be present and the measures taken to control failure probabilities may not be effective. We show that parameter uncertainty increases the probability (understood as expected frequency) of failures. For a large class of loss distributions, arising from increasing transformations of location-scale families (including the log-normal, Weibull, and Pareto distributions), the article shows that failure probabilities can be exactly calculated, as they are independent of the true (but unknown) parameters. Hence it is possible to obtain an explicit measure of the effect of parameter uncertainty on failure probability. Failure probability can be controlled in two different ways: (1) by reducing the nominal required failure probability, depending on the size of the available data set, and (2) by modifying of the distribution itself that is used to calculate the risk control. Approach (1) corresponds to a frequentist regulatory view of probability, while approach (2) is consistent with a Bayesian personalistic view. We furthermore show that the two approaches are consistent in achieving the required failure probability. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of data pooling and its systemic risk implications.",2010,2010-12-22,22,Risk Analysis,"equipment and supplies; financial management; floods; models, theoretical; probability; risk assessment; uncertainty",49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4905 Statistics,"Gerrard, R.

METHODS: In 1998, 1775 Hisayama residents consented to participate in the study. Each participant underwent a comprehensive examination that included ophthalmic testing. RVO was determined by grading color fundus photographs. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for RVO.Of the 1775 subjects examined, 38 had RVO. The prevalence of RVO was 2.1% (2.0% for branch RVO and 0.2% for central RVO). After adjustment for age and sex, it was found that systolic and diastolic blood pressures, hypertension, and hematocrit were significantly associated with RVO. In multivariate analysis, age (per 10 years odds ratio OR1.47 95% confidence interval CI1.04-2.08), hypertension (OR, 4.25 95% CI, 1.82-9.94), and hematocrit (per 10% OR, 3.09 95% CI, 1.10-1.22) remained independently significant risk factors for RVO. Both high-normal blood pressure and hypertension were significantly associated with RVO. Furthermore, compared with normotensive subjects without high hematocrit, the likelihood of RVO was markedly high in subjects having both high blood pressure and high hematocrit (age- and sex-adjusted OR, 36.0 95% CI, 4.43-292).The findings suggest that the prevalence of RVO is higher in the Japanese than in other Asians or Caucasians and that older age, higher hematocrit, and both hypertension and high-normal blood pressure are significant risk factors for RVO in the Japanese.",2010,2010-01-13,73,Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science,"adult; age distribution; aged; aged, 80 and over; asians; blood glucose; blood pressure; cross-sectional studies; female; hematocrit; humans; hypertension; japan; male; middle aged; odds ratio; prevalence; prospective studies; retinal vein occlusion; risk factors; sex distribution",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Yasuda, M.

"Martinelli, I.; De, S.V.","Rare thromboses of cerebral, splanchnic and upper-extremity veins","Venous thrombosis typically involves the lower extremity circulation. Rarely, it can occur in the cerebral or splanchnic veins and these are the most frightening manifestations because of their high mortality rate. A third site of rare venous thrombosis is the deep system of the upper extremities that, as for the lower extremity, can be complicated by pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The authors conducted a narrative review focused on clinical manifestations, risk factors, and treatment of rare venous thromboses. Local risk factors such as infections or cancer are frequent in thrombosis of cerebral or portal veins. Upper extremity deep-vein thrombosis is mostly due to local risk factors (catheter- or effort-related). Common systemic risk factors for rare venous thromboses are inherited thrombophilia and oral contraceptive use chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are closely associated with splanchnic vein thrombosis. In the acute phase rare venous thromboses should be treated conventionally with low-molecular-weight heparin. Use of local or systemic fibrinolysis should be considered in the case of clinical deterioration in spite of adequate anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with vitamin K-antagonists is recommended for 3-6 months after a first episode of rare venous thrombosis. Indefinite anticoagulation is recommended for Budd-Chiari syndrome, recurrent thrombosis or unprovoked thrombosis and permanent risk factors. In conclusion, the progresses made in the last couple of decades in diagnostic imaging and the broadened knowledge of thrombophilic abnormalities improved the recognition of rare venous thromboses and the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms.

"Cybulsky, M.I.; Jongstra-Bilen, J.",Resident intimal dendritic cells and the initiation of atherosclerosis,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the fact that regional differences in the normal arterial intima are critical to atherosclerotic lesion formation driven by systemic risk factors. RECENT FINDINGS: At arterial curvatures, bifurcations and branches unique hemodynamics influence endothelial cell signaling and gene expression patterns, which create a proinflammatory environment, with low-grade recruitment of monocytes and accumulation of cells with dendritic features in the intima. Upon induction of hypercholesterolemia, these resident intimal dendritic cells initiate atherosclerosis by rapidly engulfing lipid and becoming the first foam cells in nascent lesions. This step precedes endothelial cell activation and increased monocyte recruitment. SUMMARY: The unique features of the arterial intima at atherosclerosis-susceptible sites do not lead to disease under normal physiological conditions, but this intimal environment promotes the initiation of atherogenesis upon induction of systemic risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.",2010,2010-10-01,48,Current Opinion in Lipidology,animals; aorta; atherosclerosis; dendritic cells; genetic predisposition to disease; hemorheology; humans; tunica intima,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3205 Medical Biochemistry and Metabolomics,"Cybulsky, M.I.

DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine patients with unilateral RVO and 71 age-matched control subjects. METHODS: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-measured RNFL thickness parameters (average,quadrant, and 12 clock-hour thicknesses) were compared between unaffected eyes of patients with unilateral RVO and single randomly selected eyes of control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optical coherence tomography-measured RNFL thickness.In the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RVO, the mean intraocular pressure was 13.7 2.5 mmHg and the RNFL thickness was significantly thinner than in controls in the 10 and 11 o'clock sectors. In a subgroup analysis, which only included subjects aged more than 60 years, the global average andand 11 o'clock sector thicknesses were significantly thinner than in controls. Glaucomatous visual field damage corresponding to RNFL defects was found in 15 unaffected eyes (19.0%) of subjects with RVO andcontrol subjects (2.8%) (P 0.004).In the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RVO, RNFL thickness was decreased, especially in the inferior- and superior-temporal sectors, compared with that of control eyes.

"Michaelides, M.; Foster, P.J.",Retinal vein occlusion and angle closure,"PURPOSE: To describe a series of patients who have sustained a retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and also have primary angle-closure (PAC). METHODS: We retrospectively ascertained demographic characteristics (age, sex, and ethnicity), presentation (history and examination findings), investigations undertaken, features of angle-closure or occludable angles (symptoms, method of diagnosis, and treatment), and outcome (intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity).Nineteen subjects were included in the study, comprisingmales and 10 females, with an average age of 69 years (range 44 to 86 y). The ethnicity of the group was diverse. The mode of presentation in 75% of patients was that RVO and PAC were diagnosed at the same clinical visit. In the remaining 25% of cases, the diagnosis of PAC was delayed and ranged frommonths toyears after the RVO. Increased IOP on dilation was found to have raised the suspicion of PAC in some patients, either at the time of first presentation with RVO or at a later date during follow-up for the RVO, leading to gonioscopy and a diagnosis of PAC. Inpatient, an observed asymmetrical cup-to-disc ratio led to gonioscopy and diagnosis of PAC. Fourteen patients sustained a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO),subjects sustained a hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (HRVO), andpatients had a branch retinal vein occlusion. In the vast majority of cases in this series (18 19), no additional systemic risk factors were identified during follow-up apart from those that were present before the RVO. The diagnosis of PAC was made in all patients on the basis of static and dynamic gonioscopy. None of these patients had experienced any symptoms of acute or intermittent IOP rises as a consequence of angle-closure. Fifteen patients were diagnosed with PAC glaucoma inor both eyes. Sixteen subjects (84.0%) underwent peripheral laser iridotomies andpatients (37.0%) had lens extraction to improve angle configuration. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the belief that angle-closure may be associated with retinal vein occlusions, and should be borne in mind and excluded when investigating the patient with RVO, especially CRVO HRVO.

"Paddibhatla, I.; Lee, M.J.; Kalamarz, M.E.; Ferrarese, R.; Govind, S.",Role for sumoylation in systemic inflammation and immune homeostasis in drosophila larvae,"To counter systemic risk of infection by parasitic wasps, Drosophila larvae activate humoral immunity in the fat body and mount a robust cellular response resulting in encapsulation of the wasp egg. Innate immune reactions are tightly regulated and are resolved within hours. To understand the mechanisms underlying activation and resolution of the egg encapsulation response and examine if failure of the latter develops into systemic inflammatory disease, we correlated parasitic wasp-induced changes in the Drosophila larva with systemic chronic conditions in sumoylation-deficient mutants. We have previously reported that loss of either Cactus, the Drosophila (IκB) protein or Ubc9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, leads to constitutive activation of the humoral and cellular pathways, hematopoietic overproliferation and tumorogenesis. Here we report that parasite infection simultaneously activates NF-κB-dependent transcription of Sp tzle processing enzyme (SPE) and cactus. Endogenous Sp tzle protein (the Toll ligand) is expressed in immune cells and excessive SPE or Sp tzle is pro-inflammatory. Consistent with this function, loss of Spz suppresses Ubc9 defects. In contrast to the pro-inflammatory roles of SPE and Sp tzle, Cactus and Ubc9 exert an anti-inflammatory effect. We show that Ubc9 maintains steady state levels of Cactus protein. In a series of immuno-genetic experiments, we demonstrate the existence of a robust bidirectional interaction between blood cells and the fat body and propose that wasp infection activates Toll signaling in both compartments via extracellular activation of Sp tzle. Within each organ, the IκB Ubc9-dependent inhibitory feedback resolves immune signaling and restores homeostasis. The loss of this feedback leads to chronic inflammation. Our studies not only provide an integrated framework for understanding the molecular basis of the evolutionary arms race between insect hosts and their parasites, but also offer insights into developing novel strategies for medical and agricultural pest control.",2010,2010-12-23,54,Plos Pathogens,"animals; drosophila; homeostasis; host-parasite interactions; immunity, innate; inflammation; larva; nf-kappa b; sumoylation; transcription, genetic; wasps",31 Biological Sciences; 3101 Biochemistry and Cell Biology,"Paddibhatla, I.

A 38-year-old right-hand-dominant strongman competitor attempted a 300-pound overhead axle press and experienced immediate pain in the right shoulder and elbow. He had no known systemic risk factors for tendon ruptures including hyperparathyroidism, hemodialysis, alcoholism, rheumatoid arthritis, statin medications, fluoroquinolones, and steroid use.Right shoulder magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a full-thickness supraspinatus tear withcm of retraction. There was minimal fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus on the sagittal cuts consistent with acute rupture. The subscapularis was intact. The long head of the biceps tendon had mild medial subluxation but was completely within the bicipital groove. Right elbow MRI showed a complete distal biceps tendon rupture. Thirteen days after his injury, the patient underwent arthroscopic supraspinatus repair and proximal biceps tenodesis. Distal biceps tendon repair was performed using the modified 2-incision muscle-splitting technique. At 24-month follow-up, the patient was pain free and had returned to full activity including weightlifting but had not returned to strongman competition.This is the first report of simultaneous acute full thickness ruptures of the rotator cuff and distal biceps tendon.

"Tabas, I.; Tall, A.; Accili, D.",The impact of macrophage insulin resistance on advanced atherosclerotic plaque progression,"Atherothrombotic vascular disease is the major cause of death and disability in obese and diabetic subjects with insulin resistance. Although increased systemic risk factors in the setting of insulin resistance contribute to this problem, it is likely exacerbated by direct effects of insulin resistance on the arterial wall cells that participate in atherosclerosis. A critical process in the progression of subclinical atherosclerotic lesions to clinically relevant lesions is necrotic breakdown of plaques. Plaque necrosis, which is particularly prominent in the lesions of diabetics, is caused by the combination of macrophage apoptosis and defective phagocytic clearance, or efferocytosis, of the apoptotic macrophages. One cause of macrophage apoptosis in advanced plaques is activation of a proapoptotic branch of the unfolded protein response, which is an endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Macrophages have a functional insulin receptor signaling pathway, and downregulation of this pathway in the setting insulin resistance enhances unfolded protein response-induced apoptosis. Moreover, other aspects of the obesity insulin-resistance syndrome may adversely affect efferocytosis. These processes may therefore provide an important mechanistic link among insulin resistance, plaque necrosis, and atherothrombotic vascular disease and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to this expanding health problem.",2010,2010-01-08,91,Circulation Research,"animals; apoptosis; arteries; atherosclerosis; endoplasmic reticulum; humans; insulin resistance; macrophages; necrosis; obesity; receptor, insulin; signal transduction; syndrome; thrombosis; unfolded protein response",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Tabas, I.

Study Selection Cohort studies, case-control studies and case series limited to patients with periodontitis who underwent active periodontal treatment (APT) and followed a maintenance care programme for atleastyears that reported data on tooth loss were included.Data extraction and synthesisTwo independent reviewers screened the studies and extracted the data, with disagreements being resolved by discussion and consensus. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Data were pooled into evidence tables and grouped according to the type of study. A descriptive summary was performed.Thirteen retrospective case series were included in this review. The risk of bias assessment showed that eight studies were of medium methodological quality and five of low quality. Of 41404 teeth present after active periodontal treatment, 3919 were lost during PM. The percentages of tooth loss due to periodontal reasons and of patients who did not experience tooth loss varied from 1.5 to 9.8% and 36.0 to 88.5%. Studies’ individual outcomes showed that different patient-related factors (ie, age and smoking), and tooth-related factors (tooth type and location and the initial tooth prognosis) were associated with tooth loss during PM.The considerable heterogeneity found among studies did not allow definitiveAge, smoking and initial tooth prognosis were found to be associated with tooth loss during PM. Overall, patients must be instructed to follow periodic PM and quit smoking (smokers). Prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the possible predictors of tooth loss due to periodontal reasons.

"Song, S.J.; Youm, D.J.; Chang, Y.; Yu, H.G.","Age-related macular degeneration in a screened south korean population: prevalence, risk factors, and subtypes","PURPOSE: To identify the prevalence, risk factors, and subtypes of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a screened South Korean population. METHODS: A total of 10,890 participants (aged 50-92) who underwent a health check-up at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from January to December 2006 were included. Fundus photographs and systemic risk factors were assessed. Subtype frequencies of neovascular AMD were recorded according to angiograms. AMD was defined in accord with the international classification and grading system. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AMD.The mean age of the 10,890 participants was 57.2 6.3 years (50-92 years), and 56.2% were men. The age-gender-adjusted prevalence of early AMD was 5.07%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR per 10-year increment, 2.22) and high blood pressure (adjusted OR: 1.35) were independent risk factors for early AMD. The age-gender-adjusted prevalence of late AMD was 0.34%. Only age was significantly associated with late AMD. Ofexudative AMD patients who received fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography,eyes (66.7%) showed choroidal neovascularization,eyes (22.2%) had polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), andeye (11.1%) had retinal angiomatous proliferation. CONCLUSION: In this study, the prevalence of early AMD was similar to other studies though the prevalence of late AMD was low. High blood pressure as well as age was a risk factor of early AMD. South Koreans may have a higher prevalence of PCV than white populations. These findings provide preliminary information for further investigation of AMD in South Koreans.",2009,2009-10-01,34,Ophthalmic Epidemiology,"age distribution; aged; aged, 80 and over; female; humans; macular degeneration; male; middle aged; prevalence; republic of korea; risk factors; sex distribution",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Song, S.J.

"Praddaude, F.; Cousins, S.W.; Pêcher, C.; Marin-Castaño, M.E.",Angiotensin II-induced hypertension regulates AT1 receptor subtypes and extracellular matrix turnover in mouse retinal pigment epithelium,"Accumulation of specific deposits and extracellular molecules under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been previously observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and may play a role in the pathogenesis of AMD. Even though age is the major determinant for developing AMD, clinical studies have revealed hypertension (HTN) as another systemic risk factor. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is considered the most important hormone associated with HTN. To evaluate the relationship of Ang II to AMD, we studied whether mouse RPE expresses functional Ang II receptor subtypes and whether HTN-induced Ang II regulates expression of these receptors as well as critical ECM molecules (MMP-2 and type IV collagen) involved in ECM turnover in RPE. We used 9-month-old C57BLmale mice infused with Ang II alone or Ang II in combination with the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan or the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 forweeks to determine whether HTN-associated Ang II was important for ECM regulation in RPE. We found that mouse RPE expressed both Ang II receptor subtypes at the mRNA and protein levels. Infusion with Ang II induced HTN and elevated plasma and ocular Ang II levels. Ang II also regulated AT1a and AT1b receptor mRNA expression, the intracellular concentration of calcium Ca(2(i), MMP-2 activity, and type IV collagen accumulation. Concurrent administration of Ang II with the AT1 receptor blocker prevented the increase in blood pressure and rise in ocular Ang II levels, as well as the calcium and MMP-2 responses. In contrast, the type IV collagen response to Ang II was prevented by blockade of AT2 receptors, but not AT1 receptors. Plasma Ang II levels were not modified by the AT1 or AT2 receptor blockade. Since the effects of Ang II on MMP-2 and type IV collagen require inhibition of both Ang II receptor subtypes, these receptors may play a role as a potential therapeutic targets to prevent ECM turnover dysregulation in the RPE basement membrane, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism to explain the link between HTN and AMD.",2009,2009-03-10,22,Experimental Eye Research,"angiotensin ii; animals; blood pressure; calcium signaling; collagen type iv; extracellular matrix; eye; eye proteins; gene expression regulation; hypertension; macular degeneration; male; matrix metalloproteinase 2; mice; mice, inbred c57bl; receptor, angiotensin, type 1; receptor, angiotensin, type 2; retinal pigment epithelium; rna, messenger; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Praddaude, F.

"Bressler, N.M.",Antiangiogenic approaches to age-related macular degeneration today,"Intravitreal ranibizumab reduces the risk of visual acuity loss and increases the chance of visual acuity gain compared with no treatment or photodynamic therapy for selected cases of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although intravitreal ranibizumab did not result in substantial improvement (15 or more letters on an ETDRs chart) in the majority of cases treated in the MARINA (Minimally classic occult trial of the Anti-VEGF antibody Ranibizumab in the treatment of Neovascular AMD) or ANCHOR (Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic CHORoidal Neovascularization in AMD) trials, few cases experienced substantial visual acuity loss. The most serious known risk of treatment, endophthalmitis, although rare, is always a possibility. Intravitreal bevacizumab might be considered when ranibizumab is not available because of regulatory or financial constraints, and it might be considered in place of ranibizumab even without financial constraints if noninferiority trials show that bevacizumab is almost as good as-or is better than-ranibizumab. Systemic risks of intravitreal ranibizumab or bevacizumab are unknown, although trials have ruled out moderate or large systemic risks for ranibizumab. This therapy should be considered when initiating therapy for lesions that are subfoveal, and predominantly CNV when the lesion composition on fluorescein angiography (FA) is predominantly classic, or when there is presumed recent disease progression and the lesion composition is minimally classic or occult with no classic. Optical coherence tomography, FA, or both also might be of value to assist with decisions regarding continuation of treatment after it has been initiated. However, to date, there is little consistent information to suggest that utilizing these imaging modalities to consider withholding treatment beforeyears has been shown confidently to result in outcomes as good as monthly treatment. Extrapolation of these recommendations should be done with caution when considering the treatment of subfoveal CNV that is not predominantly CNV, such as predominantly blood lesions or lesions that are predominantly scar, as well as lesions associated with very low levels of visual acuity or those owing to causes other than AMD. A subsequent review in this series discusses other therapies for CNV being considered in the future.",2009,2009-10-01,108,Ophthalmology,algorithms; angiogenesis inhibitors; animals; clinical trials as topic; decision support techniques; humans; macular degeneration; photochemotherapy; vascular endothelial growth factor a; visual acuity,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Bressler, N.M.

A search of the literature was conducted to investigate the documentation of health risks associated with tongue piercing using the MEDLINE database as well as the German literature. REVIEWThe literature contains numerous case reports, a limited number of studies, and a review describing a wide variety of complications, especially in patients who have undergone tongue piercing. In the majority of cases, the piercing of the tongue is performed in the midline. Piercings are made of different materials, usually metal or synthetic materials. Complications during piercing, immediately following piercing, as well as long term were found. CONCLUSION: The three cases presented here demonstrate some of those adverse effects. The most commonly described oral complication is the damage of teeth and the periodontium caused by tongue piercings. Tongue piercing is a personal decision, but it is important that patients are fully aware of possible oral health hazards.

Radiofrequency (RF) analysis of intravascular ultrasound IVUS, Virtual histology (VH) offers a unique tool to study the composition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in vivo. We used data from the multicentre VH registry to assess the association between cardiovascular risk factors and coronary plaque volume and composition. METHODS ANDBetween August 2004 and July 2006, 990 patients in 42 centres were enrolled in a prospective, multicentre, non-randomized global VH registry. Coronary artery imaging was performed by conventional IVUS and RF-IVUS. The four RF-IVUS plaque components dense calcium (DC), necrotic core (NC), fibrous (F) tissue, and fibro fatty (FF) were analysed in every recorded frame. The were expressed as mean cross-sectional areas, absolute volume, and percentage of total plaque volume. Risk factor assessment included evaluation of family history of previous myocardial infarction (MI), past or current smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and the laboratory measurements. Patients with diabetes had an increased relative proportion of NC (6.47 0.28 vs. 5.86 0.14%,0.037) and DC (4.58 0.27 vs. 3.90 0.14%,0.017), and patients with hypertension had an increased relative proportion of FF, DC (4.35 0.16 vs. 3.57 0.17%,0.02) and NC (6.24 0.17 vs. 5.60 0.19%,0.01). Compared with patients with LDL-C 160 mg dL had higher plaque volume (342.1 26.2 vs. 318.6 10.7 mm(3)). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between the level of HDL-C and(r -0.149,0.01), FF (r -0.106,0.01), and NC (r -0.90,0.05). The level of LDL correlated with(r 0.110,0.01).

"Van, E.J.S.; Chew, D.W.; Vorp, D.A.",Effects of cyclic flexure on endothelial permeability and apoptosis in arterial segments perfused ex vivo,"Certain arteries (e.g., coronary, femoral, etc.) are exposed to cyclic flexure due to their tethering to surrounding tissue beds. It is believed that such stimuli result in a spatially variable biomechanical stress distribution, which has been implicated as a key modulator of remodeling associated with atherosclerotic lesion localization. In this study we utilized a combined ex vivo experimental computational methodology to address the hypothesis that local variations in shear and mural stress associated with cyclic flexure influence the distribution of early markers of atherogenesis. Bilateral porcine femoral arteries were surgically harvested and perfused ex vivo under pulsatile arterial conditions. One of the paired vessels was exposed to cyclic flexure (0-0.7 cm(-1)) atHz for 12 h. During the last hour, the perfusate was supplemented with Evan's blue dye-labeled albumin. A custom tissue processing protocol was used to determine the spatial distribution of endothelial permeability, apoptosis, and proliferation. Finite element and computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to determine the mural and shear stress distributions, respectively, for each perfused segment. Biological data obtained experimentally and mechanical stress data estimated computationally were combined in an experiment-specific manner using multiple linear regression analyses. Arterial segments exposed to cyclic flexure had significant increases in intimal and medial apoptosis (3.42 -1.02 fold,0.029) with concomitant increases in permeability (1.14 -0.04 fold,0.026). Regression analyses revealed specific mural stress measures including circumferential stress at systole, and longitudinal pulse stress were quantitatively correlated with the distribution of permeability and apoptosis. The demonstrated that local variation in mechanical stress in arterial segments subjected to cyclic flexure indeed influence the extent and spatial distribution of the early atherogenic markers. In addition, the importance of including mural stresses in the investigation of vascular mechanopathobiology was highlighted.

"Paderni, S.; Terzi, S.; Amendola, L.",Major bone defect treatment with an osteoconductive bone substitute,"A bone defect can be provoked by several pathological conditions (e.g. bone tumours, infections, major trauma with bone stock loss) or by surgical procedures, required for the appropriate treatment. Surgical techniques currently used for treating bone defects may count on different alternatives, including autologous vascularized bone grafts, homologous bone graft provided by musculoskeletal tissue bank, heterologous bone graft (xenograft), or prostheses, each one of them dealing with both specific advantages and complications and drawbacks. The main concerns related to these techniques respectively are: donor site morbidity and limited available amount possible immune response and viral transmission possible animal-derived pathogen transmission and risk of immunogenic rejection high invasiveness and surgery-related systemic risks, long post-operative. physical recovery and prostheses revision need. Nowadays, an ideal alternative is the use of osteoconductive synthetic bone substitutes. Many synthetic substitutes are available, used either alone or in combination with other bone graft. Synthetic bone graft materials available as alternatives to autogeneous bone include calcium sulphates, special glass ceramics (bioactive glasses) and calcium phosphates (calcium hydroxyapatite, HA tricalcium phosphate, TCP and biphasic calcium phosphate, BCP). These materials differ in composition and physical properties fro each other and from bone (De Groot in Bioceramics of calcium phosphate, pp 100 114, 1983 Hench in Am Ceram Soc 74:1487 1510, 1994 Jarcho in Clin Orthop 157:259 278, 1981 Daculsi et al. in Int Rev Cytol 172:129 191, 1996). Both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric HA-based substitutes represent the current first choice in orthopedic surgery, in that they provide an osteoconductive scaffold to which chemotactic, circulating proteins and cells (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells, osteoinductive growth factors) can migrate and adhere, and within which progenitor cells can differentiate into functioning osteoblasts (Szpalski and Gunzburg in Orthopedics 25S:601 609, 2002). Indeed, HA may be extemporarily combined either with whole autologous bone marrow or PRP (platelet rich plasma) gel inside surgical theatre in order to favour and accelerate bone regeneration.

"Briggs, D.J.",A framework for integrated environmental health impact assessment of systemic risks,"Traditional methods of risk assessment have provided good service in support of policy, mainly in relation to standard setting and regulation of hazardous chemicals or practices. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that many of the risks facing society are systemic in nature complex risks, set within wider social, economic and environmental contexts. Reflecting this, policy-making too has become more wide-ranging in scope, more collaborative and more precautionary in approach. In order to inform such policies, more integrated methods of assessment are needed. Based on work undertaken in two large EU-funded projects (INTARESE and HEIMTSA), this paper reviews the range of approaches to assessment now in used, proposes a framework for integrated environmental health impact assessment (both as a basis for bringing together and choosing between different methods of assessment, and extending these to more complex problems), and discusses some of the challenges involved in conducting integrated assessments to support policy.Integrated environmental health impact assessment is defined as a means of assessing health-related problems deriving from the environment, and health-related impacts of policies and other interventions that affect the environment, in ways that take account of the complexities, interdependencies and uncertainties of the real world. As such, it depends heavily on how issues are selected and framed, and implies the involvement of stakeholders both in issue-framing and design of the assessment, and to help interpret and evaluate theIt is also a comparative process, which involves evaluating and comparing different scenarios. It consequently requires the ability to model the way in which the influences of exogenous factors, such as policies or other interventions, feed through the environment to affect health. Major challenges thus arise. Chief amongst these are the difficulties in ensuring effective stakeholder participation, in dealing with the multicausal and non-linear nature of many of the relationships between environment and health, and in taking account of adaptive and behavioural changes that characterise the systems concerned.",2008,2008-11-27,164,Environmental Health,environmental exposure; environmental health; humans; occupational exposure; occupational health; risk assessment; risk management,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,"Briggs, D.J.

Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a rare but serious adverse effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Due to inhibitory actions on bone turnover, bisphosphonate therapy may result in the accumulation of microdamage. CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old Korean woman (height, 150 cm weight, 51 kg) was referred to the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea, for evaluation of pain and persistent abnormal exposure of jaw bone after extraction of teeth. She had been receiving weekly oral alendronate treatment for osteoporosis for years. The patient had the clinical features of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the mandible, which was precipitated by teeth extraction 14 months prior to the outpatient referral visit. At her clinical baseline visit, serum hormone concentrations and bone turnover markers were as follows: thyroid-stimulating hormone, 0.88 μIU mL (reference range, 0.25-5.00 μIU mL) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 20.9 (9.0-37.6) ng mL parathyroid hormone (PTH), 57 (11-62) pg mL serum osteocalcin, 8.7 (12.9-55.9) ng mL and urine N-telopeptide 21 (26-124) nM mM creatinine. She had multiple systemic risk factors for ONJ, including older age, typediabetes mellitus, and long duration of bisphosphonate therapy. There was no mandibular lesion improvement despite repeated surgical procedures performed within a 14-month period. Bisphosphonate therapy was discontinued and PTH therapy was started. Aftermonths, exposed oral mucosa had healed. Aftermonths of treatment, the pain had completely subsided, and aftermonths the patient's eating and drinking habits returned. The serum concentration of osteocalcin, a bone formation marker, which was initially suppressed (8.7 ng mL), increased 174% (15.1 ng mL) from baseline aftermonths of treatment with PTH.Here we report a probable case of oral bisphosphonate-associated ONJ featuring suppressed bone turnover.

Although the link between this catastrophic disease and very high mortality is well recognized, even after undergoing emergent revascularization, the systemic risk stratification and long-term outcome are currently unclear. The clinical presentation, parameter-related in-hospital death and long-term outcomes of these patients with acute LMCA obstruction undergoing emergency revascularization were carefully reviewed. METHODS ANDFrom January 2000 through December 2007, 1,588 patients were diagnosed to have STEMI and received emergent cardiac catheterization. The 38 (2.4%) of these 1,588 patients were enrolled into the present study due to LMCA obstruction. The analytical identified the 30-day mortality rate as 42.1% (16 38). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that renal insufficiency was independently predictive of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR): 5.642 0.029), whereas successful revascularization was independently predictive of freedom from in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.174 0.044). The cut-off value of a Parsonnet score 20 was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (p 0.002).Even undergoing emergency revascularization for patients with acute LMCA obstruction, the in-hospital mortality remains very high. Additionally, the worse clinical outcome was observed in those with renal insufficiency and Parsonnet score of 20.",2008,2008-09-02,12,Circulation Journal,aged; atrial fibrillation; body height; body weight; coronary artery disease; coronary vessels; female; hospital mortality; humans; intra-aortic balloon pumping; male; medical records; myocardial infarction; myocardial revascularization; prognosis; renal insufficiency; retrospective studies; smoking; survival analysis; survivors; thrombolytic therapy,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Cheng, C.

METHODS: This prospective interventional care series included 16 patients (17 eyes) of choroidal neovascularization secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration who were treated with PDT with verteporfin followed by an injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab on the same day. The main outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity as recorded by both Snellen and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (logMAR), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson Chart), retreatment frequency, and frequency of side effects.Seventeen eyes underwent PDT with verteporfin and intravitreal 0.5 mg ranibizumab, following PDT. Patients were followed up every month for a total period ofmonths. Initial visual acuity ranged from CF to 20 32 and final acuity ranged from CF to 20 20. Visual acuity stabilized (gain loss lines) in 14 out of 17 eyes (82.35%) and improved inout of 17(17.65%). Contrast sensitivity improved in 15 out of17 eyes (82.24%) There were no cases of ocular systemic adverse events. Retreatment was required in onlyout of 17 cases (11.76%) with a single injection of intravitreal ranibizumab.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of 203 adult Black and Latino diabetic patients from the King-Drew Medical Center eye clinic from January 1998 to March 2005. Systemic risk factors such as HbA(1c) and kidney function data were collected. FP and FA were analyzed and graded according to Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study criteria. Statistical analysis was performed to determine whether a given lesion type was more characteristic of a particular racial group.Gender, age, median microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), and average HbA(1c) values were not significantly different between the groups. The presence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME), focal or diffuse, was very high in both groups (44% in Latinos and 46% in Blacks), and the overall DR grades were similar. However, upon individual lesion analysis, the Latinos were noted to have more prevalent intraretinal hemorrhages involving a greater area of the retina (P .046).Although Latinos and Blacks of comparable age and glycemic control are equally at risk for CSME and proliferative retinopathy, Latinos may be at greater risk for a specific phenotype of DR characterized by extravasation of intraretinal hemorrhages, which is associated with poor prognosis.

We investigated whether non-uniform shear stress at bifurcations induces pro-atherogenic endothelial dysfunction and monocyte recruitment. Bifurcating flow-through cell culture slides were used to expose HUVECs to laminar or non-uniform shear stress for 18at 10 dyne cm(2). For the adhesion assay, HUVECs were subsequently perfused with medium containing THP-1 monocytes forh. Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence. In areas exposed to laminar shear stress, alignment of endothelial cells with the flow was observed, accompanied by upregulation of eNOS and downregulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In contrast, cells exposed to non-uniform shear stress near the outer walls of bifurcations were characterized by irregular, unaligned shape, induction of endothelin-1 and CTGF, as well as reduced eNOS expression. These atherogenic effects of non-uniform shear stress were prevented when cells were treated with statins (1 mumol l) during flow. Under non-uniform shear stress, a slight induction of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E- P-selectin was observed. In agreement with this, monocyte recruitment, which was nearly undetectable under laminar shear stress, was moderately induced by non-uniform shear stress (P 0.02). In conclusion, inhibition of antioxidative eNOS and upregulation of atherogenic proteins is the first step in non-uniform shear stress-mediated endothelial dysfunction, which in vivo in the presence of atherogenic risk factors may further enhance monocyte recruitment into the artery wall.",2008,2008-01-01,24,Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation,"antioxidants; cell adhesion; cells, cultured; e-selectin; endothelium, vascular; humans; intercellular adhesion molecule-1; microscopy, fluorescence; monocytes; p-selectin; simvastatin; stress, mechanical; time factors; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Cicha, I.

"Kramer, A.; Hübner, N.; Below, H.; Heidecke, C.-D.; Assadian, O.",Improving adherence to surgical hand preparation,"At present, no universal agreement on detailed practice for surgical hand preparation exists. In order to fill this gap, in 2002 a Franco-German recommendation for surgical hand preparation was published as a first step towards a generally accepted European recommendation. Based on an assessment of the actual literature, a protocol for surgical hand preparation is discussed with the aim to recommend evidence-based standard procedures including prerequisites, washing and disinfection phase, and its practical implementation. In contrast to hygienic hand disinfection, for surgical hand preparation compliance is not an issue, since it mostly is regarded as a ceremony which is carried out without exception. Nevertheless, the following factors influence acceptance and efficacy: skin tolerance, ease of use, duration of procedure, and recommended time), potential for impaired efficacy due to incorrect performance of the procedure, possibility of systemic risks and irritating potential by applied preparations, religious restrictions, ecological aspects, costs and safety. Here, we report our experience with the of a new hand preparation regime in all surgical disciplines in our university hospital based on the above factors. The following statements were evaluated: 1) The immediate efficacy of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant is impaired by a preceding hand wash for up to 10 minutes. Therefore hands should not be routinely washed before the disinfection period unless there is a good reason for it such as visible soiling. 2) A shortened application time (1.5 minutes) is equal tomin in terms of efficacy. 3) Hands should be air dried before gloves are put on, otherwise the perforation rate of gloves will increase. 4) The efficacy of alcohol-based disinfectants is significantly higher when hands are allowed to dry forminute after the washing phase and before the disinfection phase. To clarify the above questions before the establishment of the modified technique, the surgical team was invited to a meeting. As a result, the heads of surgical departments supported the new technique and decided to change their practice.",2008,2008-10-01,25,Journal of Hospital Infection,"anti-infective agents, local; guideline adherence; hand disinfection; hospitals, university; humans; infection control; operating rooms; propanols",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Kramer, A.

"Heimonen, A.; Rintamäki, H.; Furuholm, J.; Janket, S.; Kaaja, R.; Meurman, J.H.",Postpartum oral health parameters in women with preterm birth,"It has been suggested that poor oral health and periodontal disease, in particular, associate with adverse birth outcomes. However, previous reports on the topic are conflicting. The of the present cross-sectional study was therefore to compare the oral health parameters of a racially and socio-economically homogeneous group of women who gave birth before 259 gestational days (37 weeks) with those of women who went full-term. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied various dental parameters, including prevalence of dental caries, gingival bleeding on probing, the probing periodontal pocket depths, and the carriage of periodontal pathogens in 328 all-Caucasian women with singleton births. Seventy-seven of the women had preterm births, while 251 had full-term.

The significance of CD20 expression has been evaluated in childhood precursor B-lineage ALL with conflictingWe retrospectively analyzed the influence of CD20 expression on outcome in 253 adults with de novo precursor B-lineage ALL treated with either conventional (VAD CVAD) or intensive (hyper-CVAD) frontline chemotherapy regimens in the pre-rituximab era. Overall, CD20 positivity of at least 20% was associated with lower 3-year rates of complete remission duration (CRD 20% vs 55%,.001) and overall survival (OS 27% vs 40%,.03). In the CD20 negative subset, the 3-year rates for CRD (58% vs 42%,.04) and OS (60% vs 28%,.001) were superior for hyper-CVAD compared with VAD CVAD rates were particularly favorable for the CD20 negative younger age group (68% and 85%, respectively). In contrast, 3-year CRD and OS rates were uniformly poor for the CD20-positive group regardless of therapy (27% or less). Multivariate analysis for event-free survival identified older age, leukocyte count higher than 3010(9) L, presence of Philadelphia chromosome, high systemic risk classification, and CD20 positivity as independent predictors of worse outcome.

METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed at a tertiary referral eye hospital on patients who presented with DSCH following glaucoma surgery. Cases were compared with a matched-control population that underwent equivalent procedures but did not develop DSCH. The main outcome parameters were incidence of DSCH, risk factors associated with its occurrence, visual outcome and prognostic factors.Of the 2752 glaucoma surgeries performed during the 10-year recruitment period, 29 cases of DSCH (1%) were identified. An increased incidence of DSCH was observed after glaucoma drainage device implantation compared with trabeculectomy-associated DSCH (p 0.0001 odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.9 to 5.4). Risk factors for DSCH included low postoperative intraocular pressureor mm Hg 0.001), aphakia (p 0.001), prior intraocular surgery (p 0.002), hypertension (p 0.001), anticoagulation (p 0.002), ischaemic heart disease (p 0.001) and respiratory disease (p 0.008).

We characterize the systemic risk in each sector by the lower tail dependence of stock returns. Our study differs from the existing literature in three aspects. First, we compare the degree of systemic risk in the banking sector with other sectors in the economy. Second, we analyze how the systemic risk depends on the state of the economy and that of the stock market. Third, we investigate the problem of systemic risk in an international context by comparing the German and the US banking system. Our study shows in most cases considered that the systemic risk of the banking sector is significantly larger than in all other sectors. Moreover, the degree of systemic risk is higher under adverse market conditions. Finally, we find that the banking sector in Germany shows a lower systemic risk than the US banking sector. Assuming that the interbank integration does not differ considerably between the German and the US banks in the sample, this finding implies that the regulation in Germany is more successful.",2008,2008-01-01,14,Ssrn Electronic Journal,,"35 commerce, management, tourism and services; 3502 banking, finance and investment; 38 economics; 3801 applied economics","Bühler, W.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III presented the Framingham projection, which can predict the risk of CHD quantitatively. We investigated the association between IOP and the Framingham projection in 16,383 Korean subjects. The Framingham projection was applied using the indicated risk factors. The associations between the Framingham projection and IOP and the influences of the risk factors on the IOP were examined. The Framingham projection was correlated with the mean IOP in women (p 0.05). The relationship between IOP and systemic variables other than smoking was significant (p 0.05). The mean IOP was significantly higher in the high-risk CHD group than in the low-risk group based on the Framingham projection (p 0.05).

"Hahn, C.; Schwartz, M.A.",The role of cellular adaptation to mechanical forces in atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that originates at regions of arteries exposed to disturbances in fluid flow and in progressive plaque formation in those areas. Recent work on cellular responses to flow has identified potential mechanosensors and pathways that may influence disease progression. These led us to hypothesize that the same mechanisms that mediate adaptive responses in the vasculature become maladaptive at sites of disturbed flow. Subsequent changes in gene expression and matrix remodeling help to entrain these inflammatory pathways.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data 1999 to 2005. Demographic data and injury severity score were obtained from medical records. Factors reviewed included perioperative complications (nonunion, postoperative infection, loss of fixation) and time to radiographic and clinical union.Forty-seven patients with 16 distal femur and 36 proximal tibia fractures were treated using temporary EF. Patients subsequently underwent ORIF (mean time from EF to ORIF days, range 1-23 days). Thirty-five fractures were open (Gustilo8, II 6, IIIA 3, IIIB 13, IIIC 5) and 17 closed. Forty patients with 44 fractures reached 1-year follow-up. Of these, 36 patients with 40 (91%) fractures had healed both radiographically and clinically. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 14 months (range 3-68). Eight (16%) deep infections occurred, all in open fractures (Gustilo2, IIIB 3, IIIC 3), with one patient requiring above knee amputation. Other complications included one hematoma, two malunions, one fixation failure, and one pin site infection. One patient died as a result of a stroke. AND SIGNIFICANCE: Temporary bridging EF offers the advantage of early soft tissue and bone stabilization without the potential local risks of immediate ORIF in severely injured soft tissues, or the potential systemic risks in a severely traumatized patient. The 16% infection rate in this study, all occurring in open fractures, falls within the reported range for grade III open fractures (15%-20%). We conclude that the initial treatment of high-energy periarticular knee fractures with bridging EF, followed by planned conversion to internal fixation is a safe option in patients who are unsuitable for initial definitive surgery.",2008,2008-03-01,65,Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,adolescent; adult; aged; female; femoral fractures; fracture fixation; humans; male; middle aged; postoperative complications; retrospective studies; tibial fractures; treatment outcome,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,"Parekh, A.A.

These uncertainties have become more challenging because of the complex, systemic nature of many of the risks. A clear framework defining and quantifying uncertainty is needed. Three dimensions characterise uncertainty: its nature, its location and its level. In terms of its nature, uncertainty can be both intrinsic and extrinsic. The former reflects the effects of complexity, sparseness and nonlinearity the latter arises through inadequacies in available observational data, measurement methods, sampling regimes and models. Uncertainty occurs in three locations: conceptualising the problem, analysis and communicating theMost attention has been devoted to characterising and quantifying the analysis a wide range of statistical methods has been developed to estimate analytical uncertainties and model their propagation through the analysis. In complex systemic risks, larger uncertainties may be associated with conceptualisation of the problem and communication of the analyticalboth of which depend on the perspective and viewpoint of the observer.

METHODS: We reviewed patient demographics, ocular findings, and clinical courses for 25 patients receiving systemic anticoagulation with warfarin who subsequently underwent vitreoretinal surgery.Patient ages ranged from 49 years to 81 years (median, 69 years). Indications for anticoagulation included atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, deep vein thrombosis, prosthetic heart valves, and hypercoagulable state. Follow-up ranged frommonths to 36 months (median, 19.5 months). The international normalized ratio ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 (median, 2.0).

"Dai, G.; Vaughn, S.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, E.T.; Garcia-Cardena, G.; Gimbrone, M.A.",Biomechanical forces in atherosclerosis-resistant vascular regions regulate endothelial redox balance via phosphoinositol 3-kinase akt-dependent activation of nrf2,"Local patterns of biomechanical forces experienced by endothelial cells (ECs) in different vascular geometries appear to play an essential role in regulating EC function and determining the regional susceptibility to atherosclerosis, even in the face of systemic risk factors. To study how biomechanical forces regulate EC redox homeostasis, an important pathogenic factor in atherogenesis, we have cultured human ECs underprototypic arterial shear stress waveforms, ""atheroprone"" and ""atheroprotective,"" which were derived fromdistinct vascular regions in vivo that are typically ""susceptible"" or ""resistant"" to atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that atheroprotective flow decreases EC intracellular redox level and protects ECs against oxidative stress-induced injury. To identify the molecular mechanisms that control this cellular response, we examined several major oxidative antioxidative pathways and found that atheroprotective flow upregulated certain antioxidant genes and strongly activated the transcription factor Nrf2. Using a strategy of small interfering RNA inhibition of Nrf2 expression combined with genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we determined the downstream targets of Nrf2 activation and identified Nrf2 as a critical determinant for the changes in endothelial redox balance exerted by atheroprotective flow.

"Rema, M.; Pradeepa, R.",Diabetic retinopathy: an indian perspective,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be defined as damage to microvascular system in the retina due to prolonged hyperglycaemia. The prevalence of DR in the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology (CURES) Eye Study in south India was 17.6 per cent, significantly lower than age-matched western counterparts. However, due to the large number of diabetic subjects, DR is likely to pose a public health burden in India. CURES Eye study showed that the major systemic risk factors for onset and progression of DR are duration of diabetes, degree of glycaemic control and hyperlipidaemia. Hypertension did not play a major role in this cross-sectional analysis. The role of oxidative stress, atherosclerotic end points and genetic factors in susceptibility to DR has been studied. It was found that DR was associated with increased intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness in typeIndian diabetic subjects suggesting that common pathogenic mechanisms might predispose to diabetic microangiopathy. Curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric, has been shown to inhibit proliferation of retinal endothelial cells in vivo. Visual disability from DR is largely preventable if managed with timely intervention by laser. It has been clearly demonstrated that in typesouth Indian diabetic patients with proliferative DR who underwent Pan retinal photocoagulation, 73 per cent eyes with good visual acuity (6 9) at baseline maintained the same vision atyr follow up. There is evidence that DR begins to develop years before the clinical diagnosis of typediabetes. Our earlier study demonstrated that DR is present inper cent of newly diagnosed subjects, hence routine retinal screening for DR even at the time of diagnosis of typediabetes may help in optimized laser therapy.

To identify the genetic factors involved in lesion initiation, we studied a cross between C3H and the susceptible strain C57BL 6J (B6) on a hyperlipidemic (apolipoprotein E-null)METHODS ANDWhereas a previous cross in mice fed a Western diet for 16 weeks revealed a very complex inheritance pattern with many significant lesion QTLs, the present cross, on a chow diet, revealed a single major locus on chromosome(lod 5.0, Ath29 ), and a suggestive locus on chromosome(lod 2.6, Ath8). QTLs for plasma HDL, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were found on chromosomeover the ApoA2 gene. Neither of the lesion QTLs were associated with differences in plasma lipid levels or other systemic risk factors, consistent with the concept that genetic factors affecting cellular functions of the vessel wall are important determinants of atherosclerosis susceptibility. We generated a congenic strain for Ath29 and confirmed its contribution to lesion development.

"Chatzizisis, Y.S.; Coskun, A.U.; Jonas, M.; Edelman, E.R.; Feldman, C.L.; Stone, P.H.","Role of endothelial shear stress in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling molecular, cellular, and vascular behavior","Although the entire coronary tree is exposed to the atherogenic effect of the systemic risk factors, atherosclerotic lesions form at specific arterial regions, where low and oscillatory endothelial shear stress (ESS) occur. Low ESS modulates endothelial gene expression through complex mechanoreception and mechanotransduction processes, inducing an atherogenic endothelial phenotype and formation of an early atherosclerotic plaque. Each early plaque exhibits an individual natural history of progression, regression, or stabilization, which is dependent not only on the formation and progression of atherosclerosis but also on the vascular remodeling response. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the remodeling of the atherosclerotic wall are incompletely understood, the dynamic interplay between local hemodynamic milieu, low ESS in particular, and the biology of the wall is likely to be important. In this review, we explore the molecular, cellular, and vascular processes supporting the role of low ESS in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling and indicate likely mechanisms concerning the different natural history trajectories of individual coronary lesions. Atherosclerotic plaques associated with excessive expansive remodeling evolve to high-risk plaques, because low ESS conditions persist, thereby promoting continued local lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, matrix breakdown, and eventually further plaque progression and excessive expansive remodeling. An enhanced understanding of the pathobiologic processes responsible for atherosclerosis and vascular remodeling might allow for early identification of a high-risk coronary plaque and thereby provide a rationale for innovative diagnostic and or therapeutic strategies for the management of coronary patients and prevention of acute coronary syndromes.",2007,2007-06-08,1104,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"blood flow velocity; coronary artery disease; coronary circulation; coronary vessels; disease progression; endothelium, vascular; female; humans; male; mechanoreceptors; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase type iii; oxidative stress; regeneration; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; stress, mechanical; ultrasonography, interventional; vascular resistance",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Chatzizisis, Y.S.

"Siasos, G.; Tousoulis, D.; Siasou, Z.; Stefanadis, C.; Papavassiliou, A.G.","Shear stress, protein kinases and atherosclerosis","Shear stress represents the frictional force that the flow of blood exerts at the endothelial surface of the vessel wall and plays a central role in cell function and structure via managing several processes and contributes to the progress of atherosclerosis. It is a fact that interaction of blood flow and the endothelial surface is the critical interface for shear stress-dependent mechanotransduction. Vascular endothelial cells are equipped with numerous receptors in order to ""sense"" and react to mechanical forces elicited by shear stress. The intracellular signal transduction pathways and specifically the activation of protein kinases, is the second important molecular event underpinning cellular reactions to extracellular stimuli. MAPKs, comprising ERK1 2, JNKs stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), and p38s, are serine threonine protein kinases with a prominent role in cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis, by modulating the activity of downstream target proteins and various transcription factors, hence gene expression programs. Shear stress (nonlaminar or disturbed blood flow) plays an important role in atherosclerosis, where flow conditions are characterized by low or oscillatory shear stress. Atherosclerosis is promoted by decreased shear stress, as it is associated with a suppression of functions taking place on the vascular wall, such as eNOs production and endothelial cell repair. In the presence of systemic risk factors, there is an increased tendency for atherosclerotic plaque formation, which, once formed, further disrupt flow and forward growth of the fibroinflammatory lipid plaque.

"Ma, H.; Hung, M.; Chen, P.",A systemic health risk assessment for the chromium cycle in taiwan,"Health risk assessment (HRA) has been recognized as a useful tool for identifying health risks of human activities. In particular, this method has been well applied to spatially defined units, such as a production plant, a treatment facility, and a contaminated site. However, the management strategies based on the risk information will be more efficient if the comprehensive picture of total risks from all kinds of sources is depicted. In principle, the total risks can be obtained when all risk sources are assessed individually. Apparently, this approach demands huge amount of efforts. This study develops a methodology that combines substance flow and risk estimation to facilitate examination of risk in a systemic way and provide comprehensive understanding of risk generation and distribution corresponding to flows of substances in the anthroposphere and the environment. Substance flow analysis (SFA) and HRA method is integrated to produce a systemic risk assessment method, from which substance management schemes can be derived. In this study, the chromium cycle in Taiwan is used as an example to demonstrate the method, by which the associated substance flow in the economy and the risk caused by the substance in the environmental system is determined.

However, evidence from recent literature indicates that Aspergillus spp. may cause invasive disease in other categories of patients without apparent immunodeficiency, including patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Clinical diagnosis of IPA in non-immunocompromised patients is difficult. Standardized diagnostic definitions, developed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Mycosis Study Group for research purposes in patients with cancer and in recipients of haematopoietic stem cell transplants, are not feasible for patient categories with an intermediate to low probability for acquiring IPA. In routine clinical practice, most Aspergillus isolates from non-sterile body sites do not represent disease. Invasive diagnostic procedures are often not feasible in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency and critical illness. The presence of systemic risk factors, or underlying predisposing lung disease or general debilitation, may enhance the clinical relevance of a positive culture. The finding of an Aspergillus spp. positive respiratory specimen in an ICU patient should not be discarded pre-emptive antifungal treatment should be considered, while attempting to substantiate the diagnosis.",2006,2006-01-01,22,Medical Mycology,,31 Biological Sciences; 3107 Microbiology; 32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Vandewoude, K.H.

METHODS: Newly or previously diagnosed patients with early to moderate open-angle glaucoma were recruited consecutively fromhospital-based university departments. Baseline parameters, including an assessment of peripheral vasospasm, haematologic, coagulation, and immunopathologic variables were obtained. Newly diagnosed patients were targeted for a or 30% reduction in IOP, whereas previously diagnosed patients entered the study at a physician-defined target IOP. After baseline examinations, patients were followed at 4-month intervals with standard automated perimetry, short-wavelength automated perimetry, and confocal scanning laser tomography, and at 28-32-month intervals with stereo disc photography. If the patient had visual field progression with standard automated perimetry, a further or 20% reduction in IOP was mandated. A standardized IOP treatment protocol, ranging from topical monotherapy to filtration surgery, was implemented.A total of 258 patients (131 corrected men and 127 corrected women, median age 65.0 years) were enrolled. Baseline median values for visual acuity, visual field mean deviation, untreated IOP, and refractive error were 0.10 logMAR, -4.04 dB, 25.0 mm Hg, and 0.00 D, respectively.

"Chatzizisis, Y.S.; Giannoglou, G.D.; Parcharidis, G.E.; Louridas, G.E.",Is left coronary system more susceptible to atherosclerosis than right A pathophysiological insight,"On the basis of pathological, angiographical, intravascular ultrasound and computed tomography data coronary atherosclerosis appears to be more prevalent in the left coronary arterial system compared to the right. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in this discrepancy largely remain uncertain. The hemodynamic or anatomical differences between the right and left coronary artery might play a key role. Physiologically, the right coronary flow is more uniform during the cardiac cycle compared to the left, which experiences a remarkable systolic decline accompanied by a significant diastolic increment. Thus, the oscillatory shear stress, that constitutes a proved atherogenic factor, is more intense in regions with disturbed flow in the left coronary system. Likewise, the wall stress is more oscillatory during the cardiac cycle in the left coronary artery. On top of that, several differences regarding the anatomical configuration (3D geometry, branching) and the phasic motion between the right and the left arterial system appear to play a critical role in the modulation of the local atherogenic environment. Therefore, it could be assumed that the flow characteristics along with the geometrical and phasic motion patterns generate an intense oscillation of the imposed to the arterial wall stresses, especially in the left coronary artery. Over the long-term, these augmented oscillatory stresses, in combination with the effect of systemic risk factors, might modulate a more atherogenic environment in the atherosclerosis-prone regions of the left coronary system.",2006,2006-08-14,46,International Journal of Cardiology,"blood pressure; coronary artery disease; coronary circulation; coronary vessels; female; humans; male; prevalence; shear strength; stress, mechanical; vascular patency",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Chatzizisis, Y.S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mammograms of 6156 consecutive patients were reevaluated for the presence of BAC. Four hundred eighty-five women having BAC were enrolled in the patient group. Additionally, randomly selected 500 women, without BAC constituted the control group. Hospital records of the participants were reviewed for parity, menopausal status, oral contraceptive agent (OCA) usage, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) usage, presence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, albuminuria and history of myocardial infarction (MI).Prevalence of BAC was 7.9% on mammograms. Ninety-four women were aged between 40 and 49 years, 165 were aged between 50 and 59 years and 226 were over 60 years among BAC positive 485 women. A significant relationship was found for the frequency of BAC versus age and HRT usage in all age groups (p0.05). CONCLUSION: Most benign findings like BAC are not routinely reported during mammographic evaluation. Our study showed that, presence of BAC on mammography was strongly related to advancing age.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Reliability of third molar probing depth (PD) was assessed for 41 patients by trained examiners. The data for the association between oral inflammation with periodontal pathology and systemic outcomes were derived from an IRB-approved study, ""Oral Conditions and Pregnancy."" Full mouth periodontal exams including third molars were conducted at less than 24 weeks of pregnancy. Periodontal status, moderate severe periodontal disease (15 or more sites PD or mm) was considered as a possible predictor of systemic inflammation and pre-term birth. The upper quartile of the extent of PD for third molars alone (PD or mm) also was considered as a possible exposure variable for the same outcomes. Chi-square andtests were used to determine statistical significance (0.05). Significant predictor variables were included in multivariate models. Unconditional logistic multivariate models were used to derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Reliability of PD withinmm was excellent, and similar for third molars and non-third molars. Data from 1,020 obstetric patients were available for analysis. Eighteen percent of the patients delivered preterm, at less than 37 weeks. Having moderate severe periodontal disease excluding third molars, was significantly associated with preterm birth (P .008). were more significant if third molars were included (P .0005). With multivariate models moderate severe periodontal disease at enrollment including third molar PD, was associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.7 95% CI, 1.1, 2.6). If only the extent of third molar PD was considered, odds also were increased for preterm birth (OR, 2.4 95% CI, 1.1, 5.2). If only the extent of third molar PD was considered at enrollment, odds were increased for serum markers of systemic inflammation, elevated serum CRP, and oxidative stress, 8-isoPGF(2alpha).Dental examiners could reliably assess clinical periodontal measures on third molars.

The authors aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for infective keratitis in those over 60 years, the causative organisms, antibiotic susceptibilities, visual and tectonic outcome, and surgical intervention rate. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients aged 60 years and over admitted to the Sydney Eye Hospital with a diagnosis of infective keratitis, between September 1998 and December 2002.190 patients were identified with a mean age of 75.5 (SD 9.6) years (range 60-101). Local risk factors were found in 93.7%, and systemic risk factors in 27.9%. Organisms were cultured in 62.8%, and 7.9% had positive herpes simplex virus (HSV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Perforation or severe thinning occurred in 36% overall, but in 80% with positive HSV PCR. Acute surgical intervention was required in 43.7%, with acute penetrating keratoplasty performed in 17.9%, and 8.9% required evisceration. Mean presenting visual acuity was 1.82 (SD 1.24), equivalent to300, excluding 26.3% with vision of light perception (LP) or worse.

The biomechanically distinct environments in these arterial geometries exert a protective influence via certain key functions of the endothelial lining however, the mechanisms underlying the coordinated regulation of specific mechano-activated transcriptional programs leading to distinct endothelial functional phenotypes have remained elusive. Here, we show that the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor(KLF2) is selectively induced in endothelial cells exposed to a biomechanical stimulus characteristic of atheroprotected regions of the human carotid and that this flow-mediated increase in expression occurs via a MEK5 ERK5 MEF2 signaling pathway. Overexpression and silencing of KLF2 in the context of flow, combined with findings from genome-wide analyses of gene expression, demonstrate that the induction of KLF2 in the orchestrated regulation of endothelial transcriptional programs controlling inflammation, thrombosis hemostasis, vascular tone, and blood vessel development. Our data also indicate that KLF2 expression globally modulates IL-1beta-mediated endothelial activation.

The local application of molgramostim (recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) has been reported to improve impaired dermal wound healing. Since jaundice, one of the systemic risk factors for anastomotic dehiscence, causes significant impairment of anastomotic healing, we hypothesized that locally injected molgramostim could improve the healing of bowel anastomoses in bile-duct-ligated rats used as an experimental model for jaundice. METHODS: Eighty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized intogroups of 20-22 animals each as follows: group 1--colonic anastomosis only group 2--laparotomy followeddays later by colonic anastomosis group 3--common-bile-duct ligation (CBDL) followeddays later by colonic anastomosis (control group) group 4--CBDL followed by colonic anastomosis with locally applied molgramostim. Laparotomy was performed under anesthesia in grouprats. In groupsand 4, laparotomy was followed by ligation and dissection of the common bile duct. Afterdays, colonic anastomosis was performed in grouprats, molgramostim (50 microg) was injected into the perianastomotic area. On postoperative day 3, rats were killed, and the bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels measured. Two rats from each group were selected for histopathological examination.The mean bursting pressure in groupwas significantly higher than that in group(37.8 v. 30.5 mm Hg 0.01 ). The mean hydroxyproline level in groupwas significantly lower than that of the other groups (2.7 v. 3.1-3.5 mgtissue 0.01 ). On histopathological examination, specimens from grouprats showed an increased mononuclear cell population and a smaller gap on the anastomotic line than those from group 3.

METHODS: Review of AlphaCor data and case histories and literature review.RPMs occurred with AlphaCor in 14 (9.3%) cases. We find significant associations with systemic risk factors (race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus) rather than ocular history, but perioperative management may also be related to risk of RPM development. Histology demonstrates a fibrovascular tissue resembling scarred corneal tissue. Similar histologic findings have been reported for other devices. CONCLUSION: Retrocorneal membranes and RPMs with earlier keratoprostheses have frequently been reported without specific identifiable causes. Diabetes is known to be associated with intraocular membrane formation. This study demonstrates that systemic factors affect the risk of RPM formation with AlphaCor. In cases identified as at greater risk of membrane formation, peri- and postoperative therapies such as steroids, non-steroidals, heparin or rTPA should be considered.

Few studies have addressed the role that systemic risk factors play in the progression of atherosclerosis from one arterial tree to another. METHODS: We studied 344 consecutive patients with suggested coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent combined coronary and carotid angiography during a 7-month period. Coronary and carotid disease was graded as absent-mild or moderate-severe based on the degree of stenosis of these vessels. Traditional vascular risk factors were compared for patients with moderate-severe CAD alone versus patients with moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease.Moderate-severe CAD alone was found in 162 patients and moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease was found in 100 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension (P .007, odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.9), history of smoking (P .06, odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.4), and diabetes (P .09, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.9-2.8) were associated with combined moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease. Patients with combined moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease were significantly more likely to have at leastof theserisk factors (P .001) than patients with moderate-severe CAD alone.

Yet, the underlying mechanism of this heterogeneity is not well defined. Recent evidence suggests a role for the vasa vasorum (VV) in vascular disease. We hypothesized that there is a differential distribution structure of adventitial VV in different vascular beds. Hence, the current study was designed to characterize and compare the structure of the adventitial VV in the coronary and the peripheral circulation. METHODS: Samples of vessels from different vascular beds were obtained fromfemale crossbred domestic pigs. The samples were scanned using micro-computed tomography, and the images reconstructed and analyzed to characterize VV architecture, including vessel wall area, VV count, VV density, intravessel spatial distribution, mean diameter of first- and second-order VVs and the ratio of second- to first-order VVs.There were significant differences in VV density among different vascular beds. Density was highest in coronary arteries (2.91 0.26 vessels mm2,.05, vs renal, carotid, and femoral arteries), intermediate in renal arteries (1.450.22 vessels mm2,.05, vs femoral artery) and carotid arteries (0.64 0.08 vessels mm2,.05, vs femoral artery), and lowest in femoral arteries (0.23 0.05 vessels mm2 ). A similar pattern for the ratio of second- to first-order VV was also observed. Random intravessel spatial distribution of VVs was seen in all vascular beds. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates a differential structure of the adventitial VV in different vascular beds.

We hypothesized that obesity, because of biomechanical and systemic risk factors, increases the risks of rotator cuff tendinitis, tears, and related surgical procedures. METHODS: A frequency-matched case-control study was conducted. Three hundred and eleven patients who were fifty-three to seventy-seven years old and who underwent rotator cuff repair, arthroscopy, and or other repair of the shoulder in a large hospital from 1992 to 2000 were included in the study. These surgical procedures were used as proxies for the risk of rotator cuff tendinitis. These patients were age and frequency-matched to 933 controls, who were randomly drawn from a pool of 10,943 potential controls consisting of Utah state residents who were enrolled in a large cancer-screening trial. Age-adjusted odds ratios were calculated with use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedural codes and body-mass-index groups. The data were stratified according to gender and age. Multiple linear regression analyses also were performed.There was an association between increasing body-mass index and shoulder repair surgery. The highest odds ratios for both men (odds ratio 3.13 95% confidence interval 1.29 to 7.61) and women (odds ratio 3.51 95% confidence interval 1.80 to 6.85) were for individuals with a body-mass index of or 35.0 kg m(2).

"Pradhan, S.; Sumpio, B.",Molecular and biological effects of hemodynamics on vascular cells,"A variety of systemic risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes have been found to promote atherosclerosis. Although these elements affect blood vessels equally, clinically significant lesions develop at predictable locations, i.e., major branch points and bifurcations. This suggests that the development of clinically significant atherosclerotic plaques involves a complex interplay between vascular anatomy, vascular biology and hemodynamic forces. Cyclic strain, circumferential pulsatile pressure exerted upon a vessel wall, has been found to cause changes in endothelial cells that tend to disfavor atherosclerosis formation. Cultured endothelial cells have been shown to migrate, proliferate and alter cytoskeletal alignment in response to cyclic strain. Levels of macromolecules such as prostacyclin, endothelin, nitric oxide and tissue plasminogen activator have been found to be altered by cyclic strain.

"Cunningham, K.S.; Gotlieb, A.I.",The role of shear stress in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis,"Although the pathobiology of atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial process, blood flow-induced shear stress has emerged as an essential feature of atherogenesis. This fluid drag force acting on the vessel wall is mechanotransduced into a biochemical signal that in changes in vascular behavior. Maintenance of a physiologic, laminar shear stress is known to be crucial for normal vascular functioning, which includes the regulation of vascular caliber as well as inhibition of proliferation, thrombosis and inflammation of the vessel wall. Thus, shear stress is atheroprotective. It is also recognized that disturbed or oscillatory flows near arterial bifurcations, branch ostia and curvatures are associated with atheroma formation. Additionally, vascular endothelium has been shown to have different behavioral responses to altered flow patterns both at the molecular and cellular levels and these reactions are proposed to promote atherosclerosis in synergy with other well-defined systemic risk factors. Nonlaminar flow promotes changes to endothelial gene expression, cytoskeletal arrangement, wound repair, leukocyte adhesion as well as to the vasoreactive, oxidative and inflammatory states of the artery wall. Disturbed shear stress also influences the site selectivity of atherosclerotic plaque formation as well as its associated vessel wall remodeling, which can affect plaque vulnerability, stent restenosis and smooth muscle cell intimal hyperplasia in venous bypass grafts. Thus, shear stress is critically important in regulating the atheroprotective, normal physiology as well as the pathobiology and dysfunction of the vessel wall through complex molecular mechanisms that promote atherogenesis.",2004,2004-11-29,800,Laboratory Investigation,"animals; arteriosclerosis; humans; shear strength; stress, mechanical",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Cunningham, K.S.

"Chutorian, A.M.",Acute loss of vision in children,"The differential diagnosis of acute loss of vision in children includes acute loss of vision due to retinal or optic nerve disease, and cortical blindness. The retinal disorders which may be mis diagnosed as optic neuritis include Leber neuroretinitis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, and Stargardt macular dystrophy. Retinal changes which evolve in neuroretinitis, and the pseudopapilledema in Leber heredity optic neuropathy are helpful in differentiating these disorders from optic neuritis. Stargardt macular dystrophy, a disorder associated with a variety of mutations, may be mis diagnosed as psychogenic visual loss due to the early normal appearance of the retina, and the loss of vision over a period of weeks. The differentiation of optic neuritis from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), depends upon the initial appearance of the optic disc (in AION either hyperemia due to reperfusion, or swelling and pallor if total infarction has occurred). The authors have described children with abrupt loss of vision during renal dialysis, whose risk factors for AION included systemic hypotension and intra ocular hypertension. Children with vigorous treatment of accelerated hypertension, and children with migraine and pro thrombotic disorders have also incurred AION. Thus, AION should be suspected when acute loss of vision occurs in association with certain ocular and systemic risk factors. In children capable of cooperating for visual field examination, the typical change in AION is an altitudinal defect, while optic neuritis it is a central scotoma. The association of optic neuritis with multiple sclerosis, DeVic disease, and with acute demyelinating1 encephalomyelitis require special consideration in regard to treatment and prognosis.

The purpose of this study was to look at the prevalence of these antibodies in patients with RVO disease and no conventional risk factors. We specifically examined how APAs may affect the course of this disease. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with the diagnosis of RVO disease were screened prospectively for APAs. All were free from risk factors for retinal vein thrombosis and other immunologic conditions. Patients were observed for a period ofto 12 months.Lupus anticoagulant was negative in all 24 patients. Ten (43%) of 24 patients had anticardiolipin antibodies (ACAs). All patients with ACAs were younger than 45 years of age, with an average age of 33 years. The average age of patients with no ACAs was 66 years. Comparison of the average age of the two groups showed a statistically significant difference. There was no statistical significance between the two groups for development of neovascular disease. Seropositive patients who developed neovascularization had elevated titers for an average of 11.8 weeks versus 3.3 weeks for those who did not have neovascularization. Neovascular complications generally began several weeks after the titers became negative. CONCLUSION: There was a significant prevalence of ACAs in young patients with RVO disease and no associated systemic risk factors. Seropositive patients who developed neovascular disease had elevated titers for more thanweeks.

However, the role of cardiovascular risk factors for coronary remodeling has not been fully clarified. METHODS: Therefore, we investigated the role of local plaque burden and systemic risk factors on coronary vascular remodeling in 25 patients (49 segments) with angiographically normal or minimally diseased coronary arteries by intravascular ultrasound. In an additional 12 patients without coronary atherosclerosis, physiological vessel tapering was determined and used to calculate the extent of remodeling in diseased segments.An increase in local plaque burden was directly correlated with positive vascular remodeling (r 0.54,0.001). However, cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension (P 0.001) and hypercholesterolemia (P 0.03) were associated with reduced positive or even negative remodeling. Moreover, the total number of classical cardiovascular risk factors was a strong predictor for reduced positive remodeling (P for trend 0.001). In contrast, coronary flow reserve, a measure of shear stress imposed on the vessel wall, positively correlated with compensatory enlargement (r 0.44,0.002). By multivariate analysis, plaque burden (P 0.001), hypertension (P 0.001) and coronary flow reserve (P 0.018) proved to be independent determinants of vascular remodeling of epicardial coronary arteries.Cardiovascular risk factors impair compensatory arterial enlargement and even predispose to shrinkage of epicardial arteries during the initial stage of atherosclerosis.

METHODS: Between August 1997 and October 2000,eyes with CRVO were treated with intravitreal injection of tPA, 100 micrograms (50 micrograms 0.1 mL), and paracentesis. After the injection, each patient was placed at strict bed rest in the supine position forhours. Each patient was administered one baby aspirin daily. Best corrected visual acuity with Light House charts was obtained at each visit. A change ofor more lines of vision from pretreatment levels atmonths' follow-up or a change in one level (i.e., counting fingers to hand motions) was deemed significant.All patients were followed up for at leastmonths. Four ofeyes (44%) showedor more lines improvement atmonths. In this group, the average improvement waslines. Two eyes showedor more lines loss of vision atmonths. Four eyes showed dramatic improvement in visual acuity withinmonth of injection. There were no adverse effects related to treatment. Three eyes subsequently developed retinal or anterior-segment neovascularization requiring panretinal photocoagulation all were graded as ischemic CRVO on fluorescein angiography at baseline.

METHODS: We reviewed prospectively collected data for 175 elective infrarenal open AAA repairs performed overyears. A transperitoneal approach was used in 118 procedures, and a modified retroperitoneal approach was used in 57 procedures. The incisional modification, which facilitated repair in patients with massive obesity, scarring, or ventral hernia, included a higher, more posterolateral location in the ninth intercostal space. Risk factors that added to the difficulty of the repair included aneurysms with a short1 cm) or no aortic neck in 45 patients large, angled or flared aortic neck in 32 patientstortuous and calcified iliac arteries inpatients morbid obesity in 10 patients low ejection fraction (15%-30%) in 14 patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with forced expiratory volume atsecond less than 55% inpatients previous laparotomy in 18 patients previous left-sided colectomy in 11 patients large right iliac aneurysm inpatients large ventral hernia inpatients pelvic irradiation inpatients failed endovascular repair inpatients and previous failed open repair attempt inpatients.

"Sambola, A.; Fuster, V.; Badimon, J.J.",Papel de los factores de riesgo en la trombogenicidad sangu nealosndromes coronarios agudos,"Recent advances in basic science have linked some systemic risk factors to endothelial dysfunction which gives rise to atherosclerotic disease and triggers the progression of thrombotic complications. Superficial erosion of the stenotic plaque can be observed in one-third of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). In these cases the presence of classic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and smoking favor a state of ""vulnerable blood"" or high risk. Increased thrombogenicity can exacerbate thrombus formation and is able to trigger an ACS. The vessel endothelium regulates contractile, mitogenic and thrombotic activities of the vessel wall. Risk factors impair both homeostasis and hemostasis of the vessel wall and promote inflammatory signals. Platelet and monocyte activation favors the expression of tissue factor (TF), thus triggering the coagulation cascade with thrombin generation and clot formation. Increased blood thrombogenicity linked to classic risk factors may be associated with circulating TF levels which are much higher than those observed in healthy subjects without risk factors. These observations not only emphasize the usefulness of aggressive management of risk factors but open a new avenue for future studies to devise therapeutic strategies to treat ACS by inhibiting TF expression.",2003,2003-01-01,28,Revista Española De Cardiología,acute disease; coronary artery disease; coronary thrombosis; diabetes complications; humans; hypercholesterolemia; risk factors; smoking; syndrome; thromboplastin,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Sambola, A.

"Corti, R.; Fuster, V.; Badimon, J.J.",Pathogenetic concepts of acute coronary syndromes,"The propensity of plaque to disrupt is a major determinant of future ischemic events. Although they are distinct from one another, the atherosclerotic and thrombotic processes appear to be interdependent and may be integrated under the term ""atherothrombosis."" It is now clear that plaque composition, rather than the percent stenosis, is a major determinant of plaque vulnerability. Plaque disruption seems to depend on both passive and active phenomena and is not purely mechanical. Inflammation (activation of monocytes macrophages) is a major determinant of both plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity as they relate to plaque disruption. In one-third of acute coronary syndromes, there is, however, no plaque disruption but only superficial erosion of a markedly stenotic, fibrotic plaque. In these cases, thrombus formation may be exacerbated by a hyperthrombogenic state present in patients with certain systemic risk factors. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis and hemostasis. This dynamic organ regulates blood thrombogenicity as well as contractile, secretory, and mitogenic activities in the vessel wall. Some classic risk factors induce endothelial dysfunction by reducing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, increasing tissue endothelin-1, and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Vascular hemostasis, which is the maintenance of blood fluidity and vascular integrity, is achieved by counter-balancing the intrinsic clotting tendency of blood. As a consequence of the central role of endothelial cells in hemostatic control, a dysfunctional endothelium will generate a pro-thrombotic environment favoring development of atherosclerotic lesions and thrombotic complications.",2003,2003-02-01,136,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"acute disease; c-reactive protein; coronary thrombosis; disease progression; endothelium, vascular; humans; myocardial ischemia; risk factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology,"Corti, R.

Lahar is the Indonesian term for volcanic ash, and lahar flows resulting from the massive amount of volcanic materials deposited on the mountain's slope posed continued post-eruption threats to the surrounding areas, destroying lives, homes, agricultural products, and infrastructures. Risks of lahar flows were identified immediately after the eruption, with scientific data provided by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other research institutions. However, competing political, economic, and social agendas subordinated the importance of scientific information to policy making. Using systemic risk analysis and management, this article addresses the issues of multipleand the effective integration of scientific techniques into the decision-making process. It provides a modeling framework for identifying, prioritizing, and evaluating policies for managing risk. The major considerations are: (1) applying a holistic approach to risk analysis through hierarchical holographic modeling, (2) applying statistical methods to gain insight into the problem of uncertainty in risk assessment, (3) using multi trade-off analysis to address the issue of multiple decisionmakers and stakeholders in the decision-making process, (4) using the conditional expected value of extreme events to complement and supplement the expected value in quantifying risk, and (5) assessing the impacts of multistage decisions. Numerical examples based on ex post data are formulated to illustrate applications to various problems. The resulting framework from this study can serve as a general baseline model for assessing and managing risks of natural disasters, which the Philippines' lead agency-the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC)-and other related organizations can use for their decision-making processes.",2003,2003-12-01,20,Risk Analysis,,37 Earth Sciences; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,"Leung, M.F.

It is recognized that hemodynamic forces are largely responsible for dictating which vascular sites are either susceptible or resistant to developing atherosclerosis. In addition, a number of systemic and local factors also modulate the pathogenesis of the disease. By studying the development of atherosclerosis in mice, investigators have gained insights into the molecular mechanisms of this disease, although studies have largely focused on a single vascular site. Here, we review those recent studies in which vascular site-specific effects on atherosclerosis were reported when more thansite was examined. We assess the hypothesis that regional differences in the hemodynamic profile prime the endothelial phenotype to respond distinctly to such systemic risk factors as hypercholesterolemia, genetics, immune status, gender, and oxidative stress. Because a given treatment may differentially affect the development of atherosclerotic lesions throughout the vasculature, the sites chosen for study are critically important. By accounting for the complex interplay of factors that may operate at these different sites, a more complete understanding of the overriding mechanisms that control the initiation and progression of the atherosclerotic lesion may be realized.",2003,2003-11-06,467,Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology,"adolescent; adult; animals; arteriosclerosis; cell adhesion molecules; disease susceptibility; female; hemorheology; humans; male; mice; models, animal; models, biological; organ specificity; oxidative stress; risk factors; sex factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"VanderLaan, P.A.

"Chous, A.P.; Hom, G.G.",Smallpox and smallpox vaccine: ocular and systemic risks and ethical uncertainties,"The threat of bioterrorism and use of biological weapons has drawn renewed attention to smallpox, and smallpox vaccinations have been resumed in the United States. Both smallpox and smallpox vaccine carry risk of potentially debilitating or fatal adverse effects. The optometrist must be familiar with the signs and symptoms of smallpox disease and complications of smallpox vaccine for proper management and preservation of vision. OVERVIEW: The literature on the ocular and systemic effects of smallpox and smallpox vaccination is reviewed to provide the practicing optometrist with an overview of the issues involved in case management. Recent guidelines have placed additional ocular-related contraindications to receiving the smallpox vaccine. Risk factors for complications arising from smallpox vaccination are discussed. A discussion of the ethical implications is also presented.Knowledge of the signs and symptoms of smallpox infection, and of adverse effects caused by smallpox vaccination, can provide the necessary to help eye care providers make appropriate diagnoses and referrals. Understanding ethical and legal Constitutional questions surrounding the risk of outbreak and various vaccination containment strategies will help optometrists make informed decisions as health care professionals, patient advocates, and concerned citizens, as well as weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination, if it is offered to them.",2003,2003-09-01,0,Optometry - Journal of the American Optometric Association,"contraindications; ethics, clinical; ethics, medical; eye diseases; humans; public health; risk factors; smallpox; smallpox vaccine; vaccination",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Chous, A.P.

"Addy, M.; Martin, M.",Systemic antimicrobials in the treatment of chronic periodontal diseases: a dilemma,"The use of systemic antimicrobials in the treatment of acute and chronic periodontal diseases must be viewed as a dilemma. On the one hand, the approach is attractive because of the microbial nature of periodontal diseases but, on the other hand, evidence of benefit of these agents is equivocal for the majority of periodontal diseases and antimicrobials have the potential to cause harm. The disadvantages of systemic antimicrobials can be grouped under the headings of allergic reactions, superinfection, toxicity, drug interactions, patient compliance and, perhaps of most widespread importance, bacterial resistance. Mechanical debridement methods, including drainage of pus for acute periodontal abscesses, should be considered the first line treatment for most periodontal diseases. Systemic antimicrobials should be considered as adjuncts to mechanical debridement methods and, in chronic disease, never used alone as they can predispose to abscess formation. Adjunctive systemic antimicrobials may be considered in acute disease where debridement or drainage of pus is difficult, where there is local spread or systemic upset. In chronic periodontal diseases, adjunctive antimicrobials should be considered in early onset or rapidly progressive disease or in advanced chronic adult disease where mechanical therapies have failed or surgery is not a preferred option. Inadequate oral hygiene and tobacco smoking are contraindications to the use of antimicrobials. The value of systemic antimicrobials, where other systemic risk factors co-exist, has still to be established. The role of microbial diagnosis and sensitivity testing for antimicrobial selection at this time must be questioned.",2003,2003-05-28,41,Oral Diseases,adult; anti-infective agents; chronic disease; humans; periodontal diseases; subgingival curettage,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Addy, M.

"Sartorelli, P.",Dermal exposure assessment in occupational medicine,"The importance of dermal exposure has increased during the last few years, mainly because of the reduction of respiratory exposure to toxicants. Pesticides, aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are considered to be the chemicals at highest dermal risk. In the occupational exposure limit lists of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and of many countries, compounds that can be absorbed through the skin are identified by a skin notation. However, a generally accepted criterion for assigning skin notation does not exist. The recent attempts to develop health-based dermal occupational exposure limits (DOELs) have not been accepted, thus in practice their use has remained limited. To predict the systemic risk associated with dermal exposure and to enable agencies to set safety standards, penetration data are needed.

Variations in shear stress elicit markedly different humoral, metabolic, and structural responses in endothelial cells. Areas of low shear stress promote atherosclerosis, whereas areas of high shear stress prevent atherosclerosis. Characterization of the shear stresses affecting coronary arteries in humans in vivo may permit prediction of progression of coronary disease, prediction of which plaques might become vulnerable to rupture, and prediction of sites of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: To determine endothelial shear stress, the 3-dimensional anatomy of a segment of the right coronary artery was determined immediately after directional atherectomy by use of a combination of intracoronary ultrasound and biplane coronary angiography. The geometry of the segment was represented in curvilinear coordinates and a computational fluid dynamics technique was used to investigate the detailed phasic velocity profile and shear stress distribution. The were analyzed with several conventional indicators and one novel indicator of disturbed flow.Our methodology identified areas of minor flow reversals, significant swirling, and large variations of local velocity and shear stress--temporally, axially, and cirumferentially--within the artery, even in the absence of significant luminal obstruction.We have described a system that permits, for the first time, the in vivo determination of pulsatile local velocity patterns and endothelial shear stress in the human coronary arteries.

A retrospective study in an optometry clinic was performed to determine if certain ocular findings and associated systemic risk factors were associated with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (HSCAS). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients examined in the optometry clinic at the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999 to identify all patients who had carotid studies ordered. Charts were then reviewed to determine the ocular finding that prompted the carotid study. Statistical analysis using an odds-ratio was performed to determine whether any ocular sign symptom or systemic risk factor was associated with HSCAS.Of 3822 patients, 48 (1.26%) had carotid studies ordered. Eight (17%) had HSCAS of 50% and symptomatic patients were 1.6 times more likely to have HSCAS than asymptomatic patients. Patients with HSCAS were 1.8 times more likely to have retinal vascular occlusions, 1.9 times more likely to have normotensive glaucoma, 2.4 times more likely to have peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and 2.6 times more likely to be smokers, although none of these factors were found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS. However, the number of systemic diseases tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (HSCAS median 3.5 and the non-HSCAS median 2,0.049). CONCLUSION: Although no single ocular or systemic risk factor was found to be a statistically significant indicator of HSCAS, the number of systemic disease risk factors tended to be greater for the HSCAS patients compared with the non-HSCAS patients (p 0.049).

Bothered by this conceptually flawed treatment approach we evaluated the impact of PMR on the treatment of women with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes. We identified 1164 patients treated from 1982 through 1999 with mastectomy. We reviewed the records of the 223 who demonstrated four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Of these 128 were treated by mastectomy only and 95 by PMR.

To assess sequential chemical exposure effect on chemical cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of a toxicant, (14)C pentachlorophenol (PCP) was topically administered in three porcine skin models (in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro) at 40 microcm(2) with or without skin preexposure to benzo a pyrene (BaP), a known human carcinogen and cutaneous cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) inducer. In the mass balance studies, BaP skin preexposure was found to enhance (14)C absorption in all three models with detectable in vivo effect during the first several days. Total 8-h absorption was tripled by skin preexposure to BaP in the ex vivo (1.1 to 3.2%) and in vitro (0.20 to 0.66%) systems. As seen in the extended in vivo studies, total absorption was 50-57% regardless of exposure conditions, suggesting the prolonged observation period may conceal existing impact of potentially modified disposition processes, such as cutaneous metabolism, on systemic absorption. Skin preexposure to the skin CYP450 inducer BaP largely changed label penetration depth and distribution pattern in cutaneous tissues and decreased (14)C concentration in skin and fat. Additionally, BaP preexposure altered (14)C systemic tissue disposition, suggesting that altered cutaneous PCP disposition may eventually change the toxicity profile (cutaneous vs. systemic risk). The preliminary tissue distribution and systemic absorption data suggested that skin preexposure to BaP may considerably modify cutaneous biotransformation rate and thus deserves further investigation. The dermal model-dependent impacts of expected skin biotransformation manipulation by preexposure to chemicals such as BaP on cutaneous disposition and systemic uptake of environmental toxicants such as PCP need to be considered in risk assessment.",2002,2002-09-30,7,Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health Part a,"adipose tissue; administration, cutaneous; animals; benzo(a)pyrene; biotransformation; carcinogens; drug interactions; environmental exposure; environmental pollutants; pentachlorophenol; risk assessment; skin; swine; tissue distribution",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 41 Environmental Sciences; 4102 Ecological Applications,"Qiao, G.L.

"Geurtsen, W.",Biocompatibility of root canal filling materials,"of in vitro and in vivo studies clearly indicate that some endodontic sealers may cause local and systemic adverse effects. Though occasionally contradictory data has been reported from various authors, it may be concluded that zinc-oxide-eugenol sealers possess a marked cytotoxic and tissue-irritating potency. Most Ca(OH)2-based materials, however, were biocompatible. Genotoxic effects have been observed with sealers releasing paraformaldehyde or containing mutagenic substances, such as bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-ether or its derivatives. It cannot be excluded that these materials may pose a systemic risk because formaldehyde is rapidly distributed systemically following its application into the pulp cavity. Furthermore an increasing number of cases with an aspergillosis of the maxillary sinus have been observed which were mainly caused by zinc-releasing endodontic sealers. Overall, it is recommended that for endodontic practice, sealers that have been found to be biocompatible in a ""mixed bag"" of various in vitro and in vivo tests, be selected. From this point of view, ZnOE-sealers should no longer be used for root canal fillings. This recommendation applies also to sealers containing paraformaldehyde or generating this substance during their setting reaction.

METHODS: A cross sectional study of diabetic retinopathy was conducted on 1,826 eyes of 913 randomly selected patients with typediabetes incentral hospitals in Aomori Prefecture and the surrounding district. Retinopathy levels and maculopathy were assessed by binocular funduscopy, fundus photography and, if necessary, by fluorescein angiography. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent effects of systemic risk factors on diabetic retinopathy.The prevalence of retinopathy was 31%, of preproliferative retinopathy 5%, and of proliferative retinopathy 5% in all patients. However, inhospitals in which the patients were routinely examined by fluorescein angiography, retinopathy was found to be present in 60%, preproliferative retinopathy in 5%, and prolifertive retinopathy in 7%. Maculopathy was found in 8% of diabetic patients and the prevalence was 11% in the eyes with retinopathy, 40% with preproliferative retinopathy, and 50% with proliferative retinopathy. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that retinopathy was significantly associated with duration of diabetes, methods of diabetic control, hypertension, nephropathy, and neuropathy.

The patients also had systemic evaluation some patients had echocardiography (166 patients) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring-the latter was investigated in 80 patients (17 with and 63 without recurrence of NA-AION) who consented to participate in this study which was started in 1989. While optic disk edema was present, the patients were followed everytoweeks. Once the optic disk edema resolved, they were followed up aftermonths,months, and then at yearly intervals unless they had some new visual complaint. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of a fresh episode of NA-AION in the same eye, and comparison of ocular and systemic risk factors between patients with and without recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye.Of the 594 patients (829 eyes) in the study, recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye occurred in 45 patients (53 eyes) with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (rangemonths to 30.5 years) from the first onset of NA-AION. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed cumulative percentage of recurrence of NA-AION from first episode to second episode at three months 1.0% -0.4%(SE), atmonths 2.7% -0.7%, at one year 4.1% -0.9%, andyears 5.8% -1.1%. There was no significant association between recurrence of NA-AION and the systemic conditions that were examined, except for nocturnal arterial hypotension. Overall patients with a recurrence of NA-AION had a significantly lower mean nighttime minimum diastolic BP (P .003) and greater mean percentage drop during sleep in diastolic BP (P .011) than those with no recurrence of NA-AION all other measures of nocturnal hypotension were not significantly predictive.Recurrence of NA-AION in the same eye is uncommon (6.4%). Our study indicates that nocturnal diastolic arterial hypotension may be a risk factor however, since this is a multifactorial disease, other so far unknown risk factors may also play a role. The role of various risk factors which may contribute to the recurrence of NA-AION is discussed.",2001,2001-11-01,79,American Journal of Ophthalmology,"adult; aged; arteritis; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring, ambulatory; cohort studies; female; humans; intraocular pressure; male; middle aged; optic neuropathy, ischemic; prevalence; recurrence; risk factors; visual acuity; visual fields",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Hayreh, S.S.

"Schulz, U.G.; Rothwell, P.M.",Major variation in carotid bifurcation anatomy,"AND PURPOSE: Why is carotid plaque often so strikingly asymmetrical within individuals, and why does the extent of disease vary so considerably between individuals with similar systemic risk factors Variability of carotid bifurcation anatomy is a possible explanation. Flow models suggest that vessel anatomy, in particular vessel diameter and area ratios, affects plaque formation at arterial bifurcations. However, carotid bifurcation anatomy could only be a major risk factor for plaque formation if it was sufficiently variable. Since very few data exist on the extent of interindividual and intraindividual variability of bifurcation anatomy, we studied 5395 angiograms from the European Carotid Surgery Trial. METHODS: To minimize changes in bifurcation anatomy secondary to atherosclerosis, we excluded vessels with 30% stenosis. We measured arterial diameters at disease-free points and calculated the following ratios: internal to common carotid (ICA CCA), external to common carotid (ECA CCA), external to internal carotid (ECA ICA), and outflow inflow area. For intraindividual asymmetry, we compared the ratios on both sides.Each ratio varied markedly between individuals. The 95% ranges were as follows: ICA CCA, 0.44 to 0.86 ECA CCA, 0.34 to 0.80 ECA ICA, 0.55 to 1.33 and outflow inflow area, 0.38 to 1.28. The were very similar in 407 bifurcations with no disease. Among the 755 patients with 25% were present in 17% (95% CI, 15% to 20%) for the ICA CCA ratio, 27% (95% CI, 24% to 30%) for the ECA CCA ratio, 32% (95% CI, 28% to 35%) for the ECA ICA ratio, and 42% (95% CI, 38% to 45%) for the outflow inflow area ratio.We found large interindividual differences in carotid bifurcation anatomy. For example, there was 4-fold variation of the ratio of outflow to inflow area. Intraindividual variation was also considerable. These data highlight the potential importance of anatomic variation as a risk factor for atheroma and provide a firm basis for flow modeling studies.",2001,2001-11-01,129,Stroke,carotid arteries; carotid artery diseases; humans; radiography; risk factors,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,"Schulz, U.G.

"Wallace, D.K.",Preoperative issues in adult strabismus,"Preoperatively, strabismus surgeons need to obtain informed consent, identify any ocular or systemic risk factors, decide on the preferred method of anesthesia, and determine whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for an adjustable suture technique. Three major categories of complications should be listed on the consent form: Loss of vision, double vison, and need for reoperation. If a patient is at particulary high risk to have one of these complications, then the surgeon should emphasize this point during the preoperative discussion. The incidence of visual loss after strabismus surgery due to anterior segment ischemia, retinal detachment, or endophthalmitis is approximatelyin 7,400 cases. The preferred method of anesthesia depends on the procedure planned, the age and general health status of the patient, and whether or not an adjustable suture technique is to be utilized. At the conclusion of the preoperative discussion, the patient should be well informed and comfortable with the choice or procedure, have reasonable postoperative expectations in terms of diplopia, and be prepared for any unexpected complications.",2001,2001-01-01,0,Journal of Binocular Vision and Ocular Motility,,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,"Wallace, D.K.

"Archie, J.P.",Reoperations for carotid artery stenosis: role of primary and secondary reconstructions,"PURPOSE: This is an analysis of the role of primary and secondary carotid artery reconstructions and systemic risk factors on the incidence and timing of reoperations and their perioperative and late outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively stored data. Between 1981 and 1999, 69 secondary carotid artery procedures were performed on 66 patients (3 were bilateral). Of these, 29 operations and patients came from my series of 1514 primary carotid endarterectomies (CEAs). Overall, secondary operations were performed on 37 women (1 bilateral) and 29 men (2 bilateral) with a mean age of 68 years. Indications for reoperation were transient ischemic attack in 27%, stroke in 12%, global ischemia in 9%, and asymptomatic or 70% recurrent stenosis in 52%. Secondary reconstruction was by saphenous vein patching in 57% (n 39), Dacron patching in 29% (n 20), polytetrafluoroethylene patch in 1% (n 1), and interposition bypass graft in 13% (n 9). The main outcome measures included restenosis, re-restenosis, and perioperative and late stroke and death.Reoperations were more frequent after originally primarily closed CEA (6.2%) than after patched CEA (1.6%,.01). Reoperations after Dacron-patched CEA occurred at a mean of 16 months compared with a mean of 84 months for vein-patched CEA (P or 25% occurred in 25% (n 17), or 50% in 13% (n 9), and or 70% in 4% (n 3). There was no statistically significant difference in stroke or re-restenosis rates between vein-patched, Dacron-patched, and bypassed reoperations, although re-recurrence tended to occur earlier after Dacron-patched than vein-patched procedures. Analysis of pooled literature data and the of this study for stroke and re-restenosis outcomes by type secondary reconstruction (patch versus bypass graft) and by material (vein versus synthetic) give a balanced picture of near equality for each. Vein- and Dacron-patched arteries have similar outcomes, whereas polytetrafluoroethylene appears to be superior to vein and Dacron for interposition bypass graft.Secondary carotid artery operations are more frequent after primarily closed CEA than patched CEA. Perioperative mortality and stroke rates for reoperations are within the acceptable window of primary CEA. The incidence of late death after reoperations is higher than after primary CEA. The perioperative stroke, late stroke, and re-restenosis outcomes of vein- and Dacron-patched secondary operations are similar, as are those for patched and bypassed carotid arteries.",2001,2001-03-01,37,Journal of Vascular Surgery,"aged; blood vessel prosthesis implantation; brain ischemia; carotid stenosis; endarterectomy, carotid; female; humans; ischemic attack, transient; male; middle aged; polyethylene terephthalates; polytetrafluoroethylene; postoperative complications; prosthesis design; recurrence; reoperation; stroke; veins",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Archie, J.P.

"Archie, J.P.",Restenosis after carotid endarterectomy in patients with paired vein and dacron patch reconstruction,"This is an analysis of restenosis after bilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with saphenous vein patch reconstruction on one side and Dacron patch reconstruction on the other. The possibility that differences in reconstruction geometry between vein and Dacron patched sides effected restenosis outcomes was evaluated as was the value of serial common carotid wall thickness measurements in predicting restenosis. Between 1990 and 1997, 33 bilateral CEA were performed within one year on 22 men and 11 women using a greater saphenous vein patch on one side and a knitted Dacron patch on the other. Interoperative post-CEA geometry was measured. Follow-up was by duplex scans that included wall thickness measurements in the endarterectomized common carotid bulb. Over a mean follow-up of 43 months 10 (30%) Dacron patched and one (3%) vein patched CEA developed or 25% restenosis (p 0.001), seven (21%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed or 50% restenosis (p 0.01) and four (12%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed or 70% restenosis (p 0.11). The Kaplan-Meier cumulative or 25% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 22% and 0% atyears and 41% and 5% atyears respectively (p 0.002). The cumulative or 50% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 16% and 0% atyears and 34% and 0% atyears respectively (p 0.003). The cumulative or 70% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 8% and 0% atyears and 20% and 0% atyears respectively (p 0.02). For both patients with and without recurrent stenosis the mean within patient between sides differences of the diameters of the internal carotid, internal carotid bulb, common carotid bulb, and common carotid arteries and the lengths of the internal carotid and total patch segments were not significantly different and all were less than 5%. Common carotid bulb wall thickness measured at the time of identification of the nine unilateral Dacron patched CEA restenosis was 1.5 -0.5 mm compared to 1.4 -0.4 mm (m -1 SD) for the contralateral vein patched CEA (p 0.45 by pairedtest). Dacron patched CEA have a significantly higher incidence of mild, moderate and severe restenosis than do saphenous vein patched CEA independent of systemic risk factors. The within patient equality of Dacron and vein patched carotid reconstruction geometry in patients with unilateral restenosis indicates that patch material is the major local risk factor, not adverse hemodynamics produced by variance in geometry. Common carotid bulb wall thickness measurements after CEA are not predictors or indicators of recurrent stenosis.",2001,2001-11-01,5,Vascular and Endovascular Surgery,"aged; biocompatible materials; carotid stenosis; endarterectomy, carotid; female; humans; male; middle aged; polyethylene terephthalates; recurrence; saphenous vein; treatment outcome",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Archie, J.P.

"Anonymous, N.A.",Verteporfin: new preparation in combination with laser therapy: helpful in some forms of age-related macular degeneration,"(1) The reference treatment for neovascular forms of age-related macular degeneration is laser coagulation of the neovessels, but it is not applicable to subfoveal lesions. (2) Verteporfin, a photosensitising agent, is injected 15 minutes before red laser therapy in patients with neovascularisation predominantly visible in the subfoveal choroidial region. (3) The clinical file mainly comprises two double-blind placebo-controlled trials with identical designs, in which verteporfin was injected before laser therapy. These trials show that verteporfin-laser combination therapy sometimes improves visual acuity (16% of eyes, versus 7% with laser therapy alone). It also moderately reduces the loss of vision measured atyears: 53% of patients have a limited loss, compared with 38% of patients treated with laser alone. The impact of this difference on daily life activities is not known. (4) A retrospective subgroup analysis suggests that only patients with predominantly visible neovascularisation benefit from treatment with verteporfin. (5) The main adverse effects of verteporfin are visual. Prolonged reduction in visual acuity has mainly been reported in patients with occult neovascularisation. The main systemic risk is of photosensitivity reactions, and precautions must be taken for 48 hours following treatment.

"Wunder, J.S.; Healey, J.H.; Davis, A.M.; Brennan, M.F.",A comparison of staging systems for localized extremity soft tissue sarcoma,"Staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are important to identify patients with similar systemic risk who might benefit from specific treatments. This study compared four commonly used staging systems for predicting systemic outcomes of patients with localized extremity STS, as proposed by the fourth and fifth editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer International Union Against Cancer (AJCC UICC) staging system, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) system, and the Surgical Staging System (SSS) of the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. METHODS: Three hundred consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic STS of the lower extremity were treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1982 and 1989. Metastasis free survival was the end point of the study. The prognostic value of the four staging systems and their components were examined in univariate and multivariate analyses. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to identify the system that best predicted the risk of systemic recurrence.Compartment status, depth, grade, and size were all independent predictors of outcome within their respective staging systems. However, when compared with one another, only depth, grade, and size retained their prognostic significance. Of the four models, the AIC predicted that the MSK was the best predictor of systemic relapse, followed by the fifth edition of the AJCC UICC staging system.Staging systems such as the MSK system or the fifth edition of the AJCC UICC system, which include tumor depth, grade, and size as prognostic factors, are the most predictive of systemic relapse in patients presenting with localized extremity STS. Both of these systems identify the same group of patients at the highest risk who would be the most suitable for adjuvant chemotherapy trials.",2000,2000-06-15,93,Cancer,"adolescent; adult; aged; aged, 80 and over; chemotherapy, adjuvant; female; humans; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; neoplasm metastasis; neoplasm staging; prognosis; retrospective studies; risk factors; sarcoma; soft tissue neoplasms",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"Wunder, J.S.

"Fried, L.; Newman, A.B.",Epidemiologic data in clinical practice,"Epidemiologic studies illustrate that PAD is a very common finding when screening is performed in older adults. The outcomes in those with PAD in population studies reflect and extend the findings from clinical studies of PAD, confirming that older adults with PAD are disabled and have a high risk for CVD and total mortality. With the aging of the population, the prevalence of PAD is increasing. It is common in both men and women and increases in prevalence with age, such that at least 12% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older will have significant disease on noninvasive testing, most without classic intermittent claudication. Furthermore, PAD is strongly related to other manifestations of CVD and its risk factors. Those with PAD identified in epidemiologic studies have a two- to three-fold risk in CVD morbidity and mortality. Current treatment goals for PAD patients include improving function, primarily using exercise and medical therapy, and reduction of systemic risk and can be extended to those identified by screening. In addition, PAD must be thought of as a marker of advanced systemic atherosclerosis. Inasmuch as the risk of CVD and mortality in those with PAD is similar to those with a history of MI or stroke, those with PAD can be approached with the same measures for secondary CVD prevention as recommended for MI and stroke survivors. A simple bedside measure of the AAI can be used to improve the detection of PAD in clinical practice. Although there is no study that shows directly that screening and preventive treatment will reduce complications of PAD, a preventive approach in PAD patients is likely to improve overall survival, reduce MI, and will, perhaps, also reduce the risk of disabling leg pain and amputation. Future descriptions of the natural history of PAD in ongoing cohort studies may indicate that this is already beginning to occur.",2000,2000-09-01,49,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"age distribution; aged; aged, 80 and over; arterial occlusive diseases; arteriosclerosis; disabled persons; disease progression; female; humans; male; mass screening; peripheral vascular diseases; prevalence; primary prevention; risk factors; sex distribution",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,"Fried, L.

It is generally accepted that there is very few reliable quantitative and qualitative data on dermal exposure to chemicals in the general population and in occupationally exposed workers. In order to predict the systemic risk of dermally absorbed chemicals and to enable agencies to set safety standards, data is needed on the rates of percutaneous penetration of important chemicals. Standardization of in vitro tests and comparison of their with the in vivo data could produce internationally accepted penetration rates and or absorption percentages very useful for regulatory toxicology. The work of the Percutaneous Penetration Subgroup of EC Dermal Exposure Network has been focussed on the standardization and validation of in vitro experiments, necessary to obtain internationally accepted penetration rates for regulatory purposes. The members of the Subgroup analyzed the guidelines on percutaneous penetration in vitro studies presented by various organizations and suggested a standardization of in vitro models for percutaneous penetration taking into account their individual experiences, literature data and guidelines already in existence. During the meetings of Percutaneous Penetration Subgroup they presented a number of short papers of up to date information on the key issues.

"Pirich, C.; Schwaiger, M.",The clinical role of positron emission tomography in management of the cardiac patient,"Positron emission tomography (PET) is the most advanced scintigraphic imaging technique developed for in-vivo assessment of cardiac physiology and biochemistry. The currently available PET technology allows the measurement of regional tracer activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. Several radiopharmaceuticals have been introduced to study myocardial perfusion enabling accurate diagnosis and localization of coronary artery disease (CAD). Assessing myocardial blood flow at rest and under stress conditions and calculating (regional) coronary flow reserve by N-13 ammonia, Rb-82 or 0-15 water PET is the most sensitive means to detect any abnormal vasoreactivity which is already found at very early stages of the atherosclerotic process before any angiographic or clinical evidence of CAD. Flow tracers provide also quantitative information on the hemodynamic effects of any local, invasive (angioplasty) or systemic (risk factor modification) intervention. Metabolic imaging with F-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) PET represents currently the gold-standard for tissue viability assessment with well-validated information about the presence and extent of viable myocardium. The prognostic information of metabolic imaging extends to (preoperative) risk stratification in patients with congestive heart failure and facilitates the decision making between revascularization or conservative management. FDG has been also used in combination with SPECT providing comparable physiologic and pathophysiologic information but without need for the expensive and rarely available imaging technology of PET. More recently, newer tracers such as radiolabeled catecholamine analogs allowed the evaluation of cardiac autonomic innervation in a variety of cardiac diseases with involvement of neuronal innervation. C-11 hydroxyephedrine (HED) enabled imaging of alterations in neuronal innervation in diabetes, congestive heart failure and after heart transplantation. The unique functional and prognostic potential provided by PET imaging together with an expected easier access to this technology with better availability of lower cost instrumentation should raise its clinical acceptance in the near future.",2000,2000-02-01,14,Revista Portuguesa De Cardiologia,"coronary circulation; glucose; heart; heart diseases; humans; myocardium; radiopharmaceuticals; sympathetic nervous system; tissue survival; tomography, emission-computed",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Pirich, C.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause and cause-specific mortality as determined from death certificates.In the younger-onset group, after controlling for age and sex, retinopathy severity, macular edema, cataract, history of cataract surgery, and history of glaucoma at baseline were associated with all-cause and ischemic heart disease mortality. In the older-onset group, after controlling for age and sex, retinopathy and visual impairment were related to all-cause, ischemic heart disease, and stroke mortality. No ocular variable under study was related to cancer mortality in the older-onset group. After controlling for systemic risk factors, visual impairment was associated with all-cause and ischemic heart disease mortality in the younger-onset group. In the older-onset group, retinopathy severity was related to all-cause and stroke mortality, and visual impairment was related to all-cause, ischemic heart disease, and stroke mortality.Presence of more severe retinopathy or visual impairment in diabetic patients is a risk indicator for increased risk of ischemic heart disease death.

Breast-fed infants had higher cotinine levels than non-breast-fed infants, but this was statistically significant (P .05) only if mothers smoked. Urinary cotinine levels weretimes higher in breast-fed infants whose mothers smoked than in those whose mothers smoked but did not breast-feed.Mothers should be encouraged to not smoke, and parents must be advised of the potential respiratory and systemic risks of environmental tobacco smoke exposure to their child, including the potential for future addiction to smoking.",1999,1999-07-01,46,Jama Pediatrics,"breast feeding; cotinine; humans; infant, newborn; milk, human; mothers; radioimmunoassay; smoking; tobacco smoke pollution",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3213 Paediatrics,"Becker, A.B.

"Nakagawa, T.; Hashi, K.; Kurokawa, Y.; Yamamura, A.","Family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the incidence of asymptomatic, unruptured cerebral aneurysms","OBJECT: Previously the authors reported a significant correlation between a family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the discovery of an unruptured aneurysm in a group of healthy volunteers. This study corroborates and extends previous findings regarding the relationship between genetic and acquired factors in the formation of cerebral aneurysms. METHODS: The incidence of asymptomatic, unruptured cerebral aneurysms was studied among patients with a family history of SAH within the second degree of consanguinity. Forty-one unruptured cerebral aneurysms were found in 34 (13.9%) of 244 patients. This incidence was significantly higher than that found in a control group of healthy volunteers (6%). Furthermore, patients who had a family history of SAH combined with multiple systemic risk factors were found to have the highest incidence of unruptured aneurysms (32% odds ratio 3.49, 95% confidence interval 1.37-8.9).These findings suggest that patients with a family history of SAH with or without the presence of more than one systemic risk factor are at significantly higher risk of harboring cerebral aneurysms.

"Malek, A.M.; Alper, S.L.; Izumo, S.",Hemodynamic shear stress and its role in atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in the developed world and nearly the leading cause in the developing world, is associated with systemic risk factors including hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, among others. Nonetheless, atherosclerosis remains a geometrically focal disease, preferentially affecting the outer edges of vessel bifurcations. In these predisposed areas, hemodynamic shear stress, the frictional force acting on the endothelial cell surface as a result of blood flow, is weaker than in protected regions. Studies have identified hemodynamic shear stress as an important determinant of endothelial function and phenotype. Arterial-level shear stress15 dyne cm2) induces endothelial quiescence and an atheroprotective gene expression profile, while low shear stress4 dyne cm2), which is prevalent at atherosclerosis-prone sites, stimulates an atherogenic phenotype. The functional regulation of the endothelium by local hemodynamic shear stress provides a model for understanding the focal propensity of atherosclerosis in the setting of systemic factors and may help guide future therapeutic strategies.",1999,1999-12-01,2642,Jama,"animals; arteriosclerosis; endothelium, vascular; gene expression; hemodynamics; humans; models, biological; phenotype; stress, physiological",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,"Malek, A.M.

"Malek, A.M.; Izumo, S.; Alper, S.L.",Modulation by pathophysiological stimuli of the shear stress-induced up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in endothelial cells,"Fluid shear stress (the frictional force resulting from blood flow) is a principal regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. We examined the responses of eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels to dynamic shear stimuli in the presence of pathological risk modifiers. METHODS: Confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells were subjected in vitro to shear stress (using a cone-plate viscometer) and to hydrostatic pressure (using a custom-built pressure chamber device). eNOS mRNA levels were quantitated by densitometric analysis of Northern blots.In contrast to steady laminar shear stress, which elevated eNOS mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner (2.9- and 3.6-fold afterh atand 20 dyn cm2, respectively), steady hydrostatic pressure of 150 mm Hg decreased eNOS mRNA levels by 46%. eNOS mRNA up-regulation by shear stress was reversible after cessation of flow, although it was not influenced by previous shear exposure, and it was not mediated by a stable transferable factor. eNOS mRNA up-regulation by sinusoidal shear stress was frequency-dependent, with a moderate response at 1-Hz oscillating shear and no change at 0.3 Hz. Hypoxia (3% O2) suppressed eNOS mRNA expression by 78% under static conditions and by 72% under shear conditions but did not alter the fold induction by shear. Elevated glucose concentrations reduced eNOS mRNA levels in both resting and shear stress-exposed cells but did not reduce the fold induction by shear the protein kinaseinhibitor calphostinwas without effect. Shear-induced up-regulation of eNOS mRNA was unaffected by changes in the medium partial pressure of CO2 pH, by the Na-exchanger inhibitor HOE694, or by aspirin. In contrast, the shear response was potentiated by homocysteine. CONCLUSION: Both physical and chemical stimuli regulate eNOS mRNA levels in endothelial cells. Although eNOS mRNA expression is increased by shear stress, it is decreased by hydrostatic pressure, hypoxia, and elevated glucose levels. The effect of shear on eNOS mRNA expression involves a reversible, frequency-dependent process. These in vitro findings suggest possible contributions of the eNOS flow response to atherosclerosis, in the presence of systemic risk factors.",1999,1999-08-01,83,Neurosurgery,"animals; cattle; cell hypoxia; cells, cultured; endothelium, vascular; glucose; homocysteine; hydrostatic pressure; nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide synthase type iii; osmolar concentration; rna, messenger; stress, mechanical",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3208 Medical Physiology,"Malek, A.M.

We report on four cases of endophthalmitis caused by Enterobacter cloacae: two in patients with acute postoperative endophthalmitis, one in a patient with delayed bleb-related endophthalmitis, and one in a patient presenting with presumed posttraumatic endophthalmitis. Each patient presented with severe disease many days after the onset of ocular symptoms, and two patients had systemic risk factors accounting for a reduced resistance to infection. Endophthalmitis caused by gram-negative bacilli is characterized by acute onset, rapid progression, and poor final visual outcome. Each of these patients was treated by a standard protocol with intravitreal, systemic, and topical antibiotics and systemic steroids. Despite treatment, the final visual outcomes for three of these patients was no perception of light, and that for one patient remained perception of hand movements only. In common with endophthalmitis caused by other gram-negative organisms, intraocular infection secondary to Enterobacter cloacae infection is a devastating disease which, despite treatment, in extensive ocular damage and severe visual loss. Since 1966, only four cases of endophthalmitis secondary to infection with members of this genus have been reported.

In particular, we sought to identify the relative importance of the systemic risk factors diabetes and hypertension and the extent of coronary disease as opposed to procedure-related technical variables, the immediate success of the procedure, or completeness of revascularization. By life-table analysis (99% follow-up), 94% of the patients were alive atyears, and 77% at 10 years after angioplasty. Ten-year survival was reduced in patients with diabetes mellitus (59% vs 83%,0.0008), in patients with previous myocardial infarction (68% vs 85%,0.01), in patients with ejection fraction 50% (55% vs 82%,0.005), and in patients with 3-vessel disease (58% vs 84% and 86% for 1- and 2-vessel disease, respectively,0.04). Diabetes mellitus was the major independent predictor of poor survival (adjusted odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 6.19,0.001).

Periodontal diseases are of concern for this population since tooth loss from these widespread problems increases with age. In general, this loss occurs because of increased exposure time to pathogenic bacteria, not some change inherent in the body brought on by the aging process. The profession has begun to place more emphasis on systemic risk factors and their role in modifying periodontal inflammation. The current thinking is that bacteria are necessary to initiate and sustain periodontal diseases, but the clinical manifestation is dictated to a significant extent by systemic factors. Smoking, diabetes, and being positive for the interleukin-1 genotype predispose the patient to developing more severe disease. For those older adults who lose teeth, dental implants have emerged as reliable replacements, and concerns about placing these devices in patients who have lost teeth as a result of periodontitis appear to be largely unfounded.",1998,1998-09-01,16,Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry,"aged; aged, 80 and over; dental care for aged; dental implantation, endosseous; dental implants; esthetics, dental; female; humans; male; osteoporosis; periodontal diseases; periodontitis; tooth loss; treatment outcome",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"WILSON, T.G.

The risk factors were divided into two groups: ocular and systemic. The ocular factors include refractive state, intraocular pressure, and cup-disk ratio of fellow eye. The systemic factors include diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The analysis revealed: (1) only 22.6% of patients with NAION have systemic risk factors (2) intraocular pressure is not specific to NAION (3) most of fellow eyes (72.6%) have cup-disk ratio not more than 0.1 and (4) most patients (90.9%) are hyperopic or emmetropic, only 9% of patients are myopic in either affected or fellow eyes. The statistical comparison between ocular (including cup-disk ratio and refractive state) and systemic factors is significant. The correlation with systemic factors in our study was not so high as previous study had reported. On the contrary, crowding effect of small cup-disk ratio, which induces a vicious circle of generally circulatory compromised disk, may play an important role in NAION. Besides, hyperopic or at least emmetropic eyes are more prone to NAION than myopic eyes. This may be due to lack of flattening of the temporal excavation, therefore adding a predisposing factor to a generally circulatory compromised disk. The risk factors associated with NAION seem more strongly correlated with ocular factors than with systemic factors.",1998,1998-04-01,13,the Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences,"adult; aged; female; humans; male; middle aged; optic neuropathy, ischemic; retrospective studies; risk factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Tsai, R.K.

METHODS: OA patterns were studied in 809 patients with knee or hip joint replacement due to OA inhospitals in southwest Germany. Participants had a standardized interview and examination. Radiographs of the contralateral joint as well as both hands and a blood sample were obtained. Serum cholesterol levels were divided into tertiles and hypercholesterolemia was defined as or 6.2 mmolor use of antihyperlipidemic drugs. According to the presence or absence of radiographic OA in the contralateral joint, participants were categorized as having bilateral or unilateral OA. If radiographic OA of different finger joints was present, participants were categorized as having generalized OA. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of serum cholesterol with OA patterns were calculated with logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.Eighty-five percent of participants with radiographs had bilateral OA and 26% generalized OA. No association was observed between hypercholesterolemia and bilateral OA. Hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.61 95% CI 1.06-2.47) and high serum cholesterol levels (3rd versus 1st tertile: OR 1.73 95% CI 1.02-2.92) were independently associated with generalized OA. This association was almost exclusively due to participants with knee OA.

While it is accepted that vitreoretinal traction is an important local factor in the development of IFTMH, the underlying cause is not known. The aim of this study was to identify possible systemic risk factors for the development of IFTMH.Methods Two hundred and thirty-seven patients with IFTMH (cases) attending the Macular Hole Clinic at Moorfields Eye Hospital were identified. These were compared with 172 patients without macular holes (controls) attending other clinics in the same hospital. Cases and controls were frequency-matched by sex. The prevalence of the following factors in both groups was ascertained by interview: ethnic origin, place of birth, housing tenure, any systemic diseases, current and lifetime consumption of medication, severe dehydrational episodes, menstrual and obstetric history, onset and severity of menopause and use of exogenous oestrogens (in women only), osteoporosis, vegetarianism, use of vitamin supplementation, and smoking and alcohol consumption. Height and weight were measured for all participants. Cases of IFTMH macular holes were predominantly women (67%) and aged 65 years and older (74%). We found very few systemic risk factors that were significantly associated with IFTMH. There was a higher prevalence of diabetes in controls (12% vs 5%). There was no association between the majority of indicators of oestrogen exposure in women and macular holes, but cases had a more difficult menopause as judged by the severity of hot flushes at menopause: odds ratio 2.6 (1.4-4.6). In common with other studies, we found only a few systemic factors associated with IFTMH. The study did confirm, however, that IFTMH is a strongly gender-related disease. There is some evidence for the role of sudden changes in hormonal balance, as seen by the increased reporting of severity of symptoms around the menopause along with (statistically non-significant) increased risks associated with hysterectomy and oophorectomy.

Considering that some patients die because of their meningioma and others die with their meningioma, the neurosurgeon should not only be able to eradicate surgically the lesion, but also to decide if that benign tumor should be treated or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with intracranial meningioma, aged over 65 were operated upon between 1989 and 1995. They constitute about one fourth of all the meningioma-patients operated upon in that period at our Department. Main symptoms were focal deficits, psychorganic syndrome, and seizures. Mean duration of symptoms was 15 months, with 30% of the histories lasting less thanmonths. Associate pathologies were those typical of the elderly population with hypertension and senile cardiopathy at the first places. Two patients had insulin-dependent diabetes,prostatic carcinoma, andwere obese. MRI was useful either in depicting the location of the tumor or in helping the surgeon to give a correct operative indication and risk evaluation. MRI criteria for risk evaluation were severe edema and venous vascular infiltration. Forty-five operations were performed. Their duration was not a risk factor by itself, it only reflected the difficulty of the removal, due to the location of the tumor. Dissection of tumor remnants from main arteries or veins was never attempted in this group of patients total removal was achieved in 75.5% of the cases.Immediate postoperative were good in 71% of cases.

Among the NIDDM patients, those ones with proliferative retinopathy had the lowest mean age of 40.5 1.42 vs. 49.7 0.61 years (p 0.01) at diabetes manifestation. There was no statistical difference between mean HbA1c concentrations in relation to retinopathy stages. Albumin excretion was increased in both IDDM and NIDDM patients with proliferative retinopathy (p 0.01) along with increased BMI of IDDM and increased insulin requirement of NIDDM patients (p 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that proliferative retinopathy with the inclusion of non-proliferative retinopathy of IDDM and NIDDM patients was significantly correlated with diabetes duration, albumin excretion, somatic and autonomic neuropathy (p 0.01). In NIDDM patients proliferative retinopathy with the inclusion of non-proliferative retinopathy was correlated with the age at diabetes manifestation and with cholesterol levels (p 0.05). In IDDM and NIDDM patients proliferative retinopathy was found to be correlated with somatic and autonomic neuropathy, albumin excretion (p 0.01) and hypertension (p 0.05). The importance of the significant correlation of autonomic neuropathy both with and proliferative retinopathy in IDDM and NIDDM patients needs to be prospectively investigated.",1997,1997-01-01,13,Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology & Diabetes,"adolescent; adult; albuminuria; body mass index; cardiovascular system; cross-sectional studies; diabetes mellitus, type 1; diabetes mellitus, type 2; diabetic neuropathies; diabetic retinopathy; female; glycated hemoglobin; humans; male; middle aged; regression analysis",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Zander1, E.

"Donnelly, C.A.; Seth, J.; Clayton, R.M.; Phillips, C.I.; Cuthbert, J.",Some plasma constituents correlate with human cataract location and nuclear colour,"AIMS: To look for differences in levels of various plasma constituents between pair-matched controls and patients who had cataracts classified by location and appearance of lens opacity and nuclear colour in order to identify systemic risk factors. METHODS: One thousand patients were taken from the cataract waiting list of a specialist eye hospital. For each patient, a matched control of the same sex and half-decade of age but without cataract was taken from the patient-list of the family doctor of the patient the control was the next alphabetically after the patient on the doctor's list. At an early morning visit to the homes of both patients and controls, fasting, a team of nurses performed venepunctures and collected information for a questionnaire. Eye examinations were performed by a team of ophthalmologists.Predominantly nuclear cataract was significantly associated with raised plasma alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin, posterior subcapsular cataract with increased calcium and urea, cuneiform with reduced potassium, mature hypermature with raised potassium and reduced total carbon dioxide. The following were consistently significantly associated with all forms of cataract diabetes and raised plasma glucose (not in non-diabetics), use of steroid medication, raised levels of cortisol (steroid users excluded), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, sodium and total protein and reduced levels of cholesterol and albumin (total protein-albumin) ratio (an approximation for the albumin globulin ratio). The multivariate analysis indicated that the most important non-specific cataractogenic effects were those of increased total protein, diabetes and use of steroid medication. CONCLUSION: This and other studies support, broadly, the that senile or age-related cataract is not merely caused by increasing age and also that various morphological types have different risk factors. The mechanisms underlying the biochemical associations with different patterns of lens opacification and the identification of the ultimate risk factors remain to be elucidated.",1997,1997-01-01,8,Ophthalmic Research,"aged; aging; blood glucose; blood proteins; calcium; case-control studies; cataract; female; humans; lens nucleus, crystalline; male; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; potassium; risk factors; triglycerides; urea",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Donnelly, C.A.

To define the risk of infection associated with dental surgery, a retrospective review of the records of 3490 patients treated with total knee arthroplasty by the authors between 1982 and 1993 was performed. Sixty-two total knee arthroplasties with late infections (greater thanmonths after their procedure) were identified, and of these, seven infections were associated strongly with a dental procedure temporally and bacteriologically. These seven cases represented 11% of the identified infections or 0.2% of the total knee arthroplasty procedures performed during this period. In addition, among 12 patients referred for infected total knee arthroplasties from outside institutions, two infections were associated with a dental procedure. Five of the nine (56%) patients had systemic risk factors that predisposed them to infection, including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. All dental procedures were extensive in nature (average, 115 minutes range, 75-205 minutes). Eight of the patients received no antibiotic prophylaxis. One patient had only one preoperative dose. Infections associated with dental procedures may be more common than previously suspected. Eight of these patients had no prophylactic antibiotics, and one had inadequate coverage. The authors think that patients with a total knee arthroplasty who have systemic disease that compromises host defense mechanisms against infections and who undergo extensive dental procedures should receive prophylactic antibiotics.

"Genco, R.J.",Current view of risk factors for periodontal diseases,"Periodontal diseases are infections, and many forms of the disease are associated with specific pathogenic bacteria which colonize the subgingival area. At least two of these microorganisms, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, also invade the periodontal tissue and are virulent organisms. Initiation and progression of periodontal infections are clearly modified by local and systemic conditions called risk factors. The local factors include pre-existing disease as evidenced by deep probing depths and plaque retention areas associated with defective restorations. Systemic risk factors recently have been identified by large epidemiologic studies using multifactorial statistical analyses to correct for confounding or associated co-risk factors. Risk factors which we know today as important include diabetes mellitus, especially in individuals in whom metabolic control is poor, and cigarette smoking. These two risk factors markedly affect the initiation and progression of periodontitis, and attempts to manage these factors are now an important component of prevention and treatment of adult periodontitis. Systemic conditions associated with reduced neutrophil numbers or function are also important risk factors in children, juveniles, and young adults. Diseases in which neutrophil dysfunction occurs include the lazy leukocyte syndrome associated with localized juvenile periodontitis, cyclic neutropenia, and congenital neutropenia. Recent studies also point to several potentially important periodontal risk indicators. These include stress and coping behaviors, and osteopenia associated with estrogen deficiency. There are also determinants associated with periodontal disease including gender (with males having more disease), age (with more disease seen in the elderly), and hereditary factors. The study of risk in periodontal disease is a rapidly emerging field and much is yet to be learned. However, there are at least two significant risk factors-smoking and diabetes-which demand attention in current management of periodontal disease.Periodontol 1996 67:1041-1049.",1996,1996-10-01,466,Journal of Periodontology,actinobacillus infections; adolescent; adult; age factors; aged; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; bacteroidaceae infections; child; dental plaque; diabetes complications; disease progression; epidemiologic methods; female; humans; leukocyte count; male; neutropenia; neutrophils; periodontal diseases; periodontal pocket; periodontitis; periodontium; porphyromonas gingivalis; risk factors; sex factors; smoking; virulence,32 biomedical and clinical sciences; 3203 dentistry,"Genco, R.J.

Florid diabetic retinopathy was reported to carry a high risk of blindness. This study was conducted to determine whether visual prognosis of FDR can be improved by appropriate photocoagulation and surgical management. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied 20 patients (40 eyes) who were treated from October 1978 to February 1994. Systemic risk factors, visual acuity, complete ocular examination, and fundus findings, as well as fluorescein angiography, were analyzed with respect to photocoagulation and surgical management. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years.All patients had poorly controlled typediabetes (mean duration, 13.5 years), which often was associated with systemic complications. Mean initial visual acuity was equal to or better than 20 40 in 32 eyes (80%). During the course of the study, high-risk PDR was observed in 38 eyes (95%) and vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 26 eyes (65%). Extensive full subconfluent panretinal photocoagulation was performed completely in 37 eyes (92.5%). Vitrectomy was necessary in 15 eyes (37.5%). Macular edema was present in 30 eyes (75%). Major complications included retinal detachment that required surgery (2 eyes, 5%) and neovascular glaucoma (2 eyes, 5%). However, final visual acuity was equal to or better than 20 40 in 23 eyes (57.5%) and less than200 in onlyeyes (10%). CONCLUSION: These suggest that aggressive treatment of FDR with extensive panretinal photocoagulation and early vitrectomy, when necessary, may result in a much better prognosis than has been reported previously.",1996,1996-04-01,28,Ophthalmology,"adolescent; adult; diabetes mellitus, type 1; diabetic retinopathy; female; fluorescein angiography; fundus oculi; humans; laser coagulation; male; postoperative complications; prognosis; retina; retinal vessels; retrospective studies; visual acuity; vitrectomy",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Favard, C.

We hypothesized that certain endothelial genes, which exhibit differential responsiveness to distinct fluid mechanical stimuli, may participate in the atherogenic process by modulating, on a local level within the arterial wall, the effects of systemic risk factors. A differential display strategy using cultured human endothelial cells has identified two genes, manganese superoxide dismutase and cyclooxygenase-2, that exhibit selective and sustained up-regulation by steady laminar shear stress (LSS). Turbulent shear stress, a nonlaminar fluid mechanical stimulus, does not induce these genes. The endothelial form of nitric oxide synthase also demonstrates a similar LSS-selective pattern of induction. Thus, three genes with potential atheroprotective (antioxidant, antithrombotic, and antiadhesive) activities manifest a differential response to distinct fluid mechanical stimuli, providing a possible mechanistic link between endothelial gene expression and early events in atherogenesis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A data base was formed of 5,172 patients randomized onto two intergroup trials. Lumpectomy rates were analyzed within study-defined risk strata and across geographic regions. Significant predictors of lower lumpectomy usage were determined in multivariate analyses with variables that described patient and disease characteristics, systemic risk strata, geographic region, and socioeconomic indicators based on zip code of residence.Breast-conservation rates were 30% in the node-negative and 15% in the node-positive trials, with a wide geographic variation within each study (range, 14% to 49% and 9% to 31%, respectively).

"Wain, J.C.",Management of late postpneumonectomy empyema and bronchopleural fistula,"Postpneumonectomy empyema occurs in 5% of pneumonectomy patients, more commonly with completion pneumonectomy, right pneumonectomy, operations for sepsis, mediastinal lymph node dissections, and in patients requiring postoperative mechanical ventilation. BPF is identified in over 80% of patients at presentation. Optimal management includes prevention by minimizing perioperative sepsis, meticulous bronchial closure, and the use of vascularized flaps to reinforce the bronchial stump. Management of the developed complication requires flexible bronchoscopy, drainage of the empyema space initially by closed tube drainage, and later by open thoracostomy, appropriate therapy of the underlying infection, and identification and correction of systemic risk factors. Surgical interventions to obliterate the residual empyema space are successful in 80% of cases. Closure of BPF occurs spontaneously in one third of cases, but can be achieved in 86% of cases with aggressive surgical interventions involving reclosure of the bronchial stump and transposition of vascularized flaps. The mortality of postpneumonectomy empyema, with or without BPF, ranges from 23% to 50%. The mortality for surgical intervention is 10%. In the absence of debilitating systemic illness, such as metastatic lung cancer, aggressive surgical intervention is the optimal method of management for postpneumonectomy empyema with an associated bronchopleural fistula.",1996,1996-08-01,51,Thoracic Surgery Clinics,"bronchial fistula; empyema, pleural; fistula; humans; pleural diseases; pneumonectomy; postoperative complications; time factors; tomography, x-ray computed",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Wain, J.C.

"Friedman, M.H.; Baker, P.B.; Ding, Z.; Kuban, B.D.",Relationship between the geometry and quantitative morphology of the left anterior descending coronary artery,"The well established 'systemic' risk factors for atherosclerosis can explain only half of the variability in its occurrence. To account for some of the remaining variability, it was suggested that certain geometric features of atherosclerosis-prone segments ('geometric risk factors') can increase the likelihood of disease locally through their influence on the hemodynamic environment of the vessel wall. Since this mediation might elicit early morphological changes in the artery, relationships were sought between the histomorphometry and axial geometry of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary arteries of 15 angiographically lesion-free human hearts obtained at autopsy. Geometric variables were quantified by image processing of multiplane angiograms of the hearts, and morphometry was obtained from transverse histologic sections at 91 sites. The show that: (1) total intimal and medial area are negatively correlated with the distance from the site to the origin of the LAD (2) the angle of the branch immediately proximal to the site is positively correlated with most of the intimal and medial variables, and appears to have a major influence on the intima (3) the area ratio of the immediately proximal branch is correlated primarily with medial variables and (4) local curvature is correlated only with the maximum thickness of the intima and media.

Ambulatory 24-hour BP monitoring and inpatient IOP curves were done on two consecutive days on 36 patients (17 women, 19 men, mean age 67.44 8.06 years) with moderate to severe POAG and good diurnal therapeutic control of IOP (daytime IOP or 21 mm Hg).

We compared local and systemic risk factors for POAG, mean and maximum daytime and nighttime IOP in each group. The mean systolic and diastolic daytime BP, mean systolic and diastolic nighttime BP and the nocturnal systolic and diastolic BP dip were calculated for each patient.

Periodontal diseases are infections with a high potential for recurrence, progressive loss of attachment and eventually, tooth loss. Current therapies for periodontal diseases are highly predictable in arresting disease activity. Supportive periodontal care has been shown to be very effective in maintaining support when adapted to each particular case. Nevertheless, current maintenance therapies may be unsuccessful in preventing further loss of attachment in a small number of sites for some patients. Tests aiming at bacterial identification and the subgingival application of antimicrobials may be helpful in the management of such cases, however the practical value in a specific setting is not known.

METHODS: One thousand seven hundred eleven optic disc stereo photographs of patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension and of those suspected of having glaucoma were reviewed to identify pure examples of discs with four different optic disc appearances: focal ischemic discs, myopic glaucomatous discs, senile sclerotic discs, and generalized enlargement of the optic cup discs. The clinical charts of the selected patients were reviewed, with emphasis on the presence of predetermined ocular and systemic risk factors. Their automated visual fields also were analyzed.Thiry-four patients with focal ischemic discs, 38 with myopic glaucomatous discs, 22 with senile sclerotic discs, and 23 with generalized enlargement of the optic cup discs were selected. Patients with myopic glaucoma and generalized enlargement of the optic cup discs were significantly younger than patients with focal ischemic and senile sclerotic discs. There were more women in the focal ischemic group. Patients with senile sclerotic discs had a significantly higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease they also had a higher prevalence of systemic hypertension, which did not reach statistical significance. Migraine was 2.5 times more frequent in the focal ischemic group than in the other groups. Intraocular pressure was significantly higher in the generalized enlargement group. The pattern of visual field defect in the four groups also was distinctly different.Patients with different disc appearances, selected only from their disc photographs, showed differences in their demographic characteristics, prevalence of certain systemic risk factors, intraocular pressure levels, and the pattern of their visual field damage.

One measure of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, the 30:15 ratio, the heart rate variation at the 30th beat compared with that at the 15th beat, was lower among patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (P .0049) The risk of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients with an abnormal cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy index was 2.59, although the estimate was not statistically significant because of the small number of patients who developed proliferative diabetic retinopathy.This study provides prospective evidence that cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

"Costini, B.; Larroque, G.; Duboscq, J.C.; Montandon, D.",Noma or cancrum oris: etiopathogenic and nosologic aspects,"Noma is a gangrenous disease that usually begins in the mouth and is characterized by rapid necrotizing destruction of soft tissue and underlying bone. The disease, which is associated with a strong putrid odor suggestive of mixed bacterial infection, develops only in predisposed persons, especially children whose natural defenses have been weakened by poor socio-economic living conditions. However a few atypical cases have recently been reported in adults in whom the main risk factor seemed to be immunodepression. The increasing number of wars in the Third World and the AIDS epidemic raise the likelihood that the number of cases of this disease will rise sharply particularly since the incidence has been grossly underestimated for many years. It now seems clear that a combination of local and systemic risk factors are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of noma with the common denominator being a weakened immune system. This would account for the fulminating course of the infectious process due to one or more opportunistic microbial or cytopathogenic agents or even to a still undetermined immunopathologic reaction that lead to massive tissue destruction. Poor understanding of the etiopathogenesis of noma is a major factor perpetuating the nosologic problems posed by this disease. Some authors add to the confusion by including a range of gangrenous diseases under the heading of noma. It is important that the term noma be applied only to necrotizing processes that begin in the mouth and present the characteristic features and course.",1995,1995-01-01,17,Medecine Tropicale,"adult; child; child nutrition disorders; global health; humans; immunocompromised host; incidence; infant, newborn; noma; oral hygiene; risk factors; socioeconomic factors; terminology as topic",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Costini, B.

METHODS: Ten normal volunteers, whose ages ranged from 17 to 34 years, performed RB over 135 to 260 seconds (mean (SD) 193 (38) seconds) while retinal macular blood velocity was determined non-invasively using the blue field simulation technique.Leucocyte velocity significantly increased (p 0.05) atminutes and at the end of RB by 53% (42%) and 92% (65%), respectively (95% confidence interval of the mean (CIM)). All subjects observed an increase in the density of leucocytes. At the end of RB, mean systolic brachial arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly increased by 24% (11%) and 37% (15%) respectively (p 0.01). Atminutes, end tidal oxygen concentration in the exhaled air was 47% (8%) (95% CIM) below and carbon dioxide was 41% (16%) above baseline (p 0.001). The RB produces a large increase in macular leucocyte velocity, suggesting an increase in blood flow.

"Douglass, C.W.",Is dental practice science based,"This paper explores the thesis that the changing medical needs of dental patients, advances in biomedical research, and the confluence of the financing of medical and dental care will result in closer linkages between the medical and dental care delivery systems during the next century. Five trends have been documented in support of this thesis: the increasing number of elderly and their retention of teeth means there is a greater need for restorative dental care than in previous generations the elderly have chronic diseases and are taking more medications younger patients are presenting more frequently with infectious, systemic diseases such as HIV AIDS. New scientific discoveries are opening new possibilities for patient care, which generate even higher expectations on the part of future consumers of medical and dental services. The health and fitness trend is not a fad new knowledge regarding diet, nutrition, and exercise is identifying systemic risk factors related to common oral pathologies. Medical and dental educators are paying increased attention to the application of basic sciences to patient care. HMOs are increasing their market share of medical care delivery and expanding their services with preventive care and total patient care, including dental services. Data are provided documenting that dentists see these trends occurring in their private practices. The paper concludes that the application of advances in science and technology to oral health will improve the quality of dentistry. However, only new, effective preventive agents will decrease the cost of care, while improved diagnostics and restorative technologies could increase dental care costs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,1994-01-01,1,Journal of the American College of Dentists,"attitude of health personnel; attitude to health; delivery of health care; dental care; dental care for chronically ill; education, dental; humans; quality assurance, health care; research",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,"Douglass, C.W.

"Wakakura, M.; Ishikawa, S.",Neuro-ophthalmic aspects of vascular disease,"One of the most susceptible sites to vascular diseases is the optic nerve head. By innovative approaches using morphometry and in situ hybridization, vascular and extracellular characteristics of the human optic nerve head were examined. Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy occurs due to vascular insufficiency within the optic nerve head. Various local and systemic risk factors have been proposed among which smoking and acute hypotension are now included. Anatomically abnormal discs such as the small optic disc, tilted disc, and optic nerve drusen are recognized as ""disks at risk"" and hyperopia may be an additional predisposing factor. Ocular, neurological, and vascular disorders due to giant cell arteritis were reviewed. Intravenous high-dose methylprednine should be administered in certain cases. Differentiating nonarteritic from arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy is sometimes difficult. Isolated choroidal ischemia or choroidal filling delay may be an indication of giant cell arteritis. Studies have been conducted on the vascular event, amaurosis fugax (transient monocular visual loss), and the of some of these studies are discussed.",1994,1994-12-01,5,Current Opinion in Ophthalmology,blindness; giant cell arteritis; humans; ischemia; optic disk; optic nerve; optic nerve diseases; vision disorders,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,"Wakakura, M.

In this analysis, patients with locally recurrent (9) or persistent (2) cancer following nephrectomy (renal cell cancer in 8, transitional cell or squamous cell cancer in 3) usually received 4,500 to 5,040 cGy. preoperative external beam irradiation followed by maximal surgical debulking and intraoperative electron irradiation (1,000 to 2,500 cGy.).

Of thetransitional or squamous cell carcinoma patientsdied free of disease 28.5 months after initiation of treatment for recurrence anddied of disease progression (liver inand local in 1). It appears that select patients with solitary local recurrence or persistence following radical nephrectomy for renal cell cancer may benefit from an aggressive local treatment approach using irradiation (preoperatively and intraoperatively) plus maximal surgical debulking. In patients with locally advanced high grade transitional cell cancer the locally aggressive approach should probably be combined with multi-drug chemotherapy because of increased systemic risks. For both groups (renal cell carcinoma and transitional squamous cell carcinoma) the most ideal patient for such treatment is one who has not received prior chemotherapy or external irradiation to the site of relapse, sinceofpatients with disease progression after our aggressive approach had received chemotherapy (2) or external beam irradiation (2) elsewhere before referral.",1994,1994-07-01,59,Investigative Urology,"aged; carcinoma, renal cell; carcinoma, transitional cell; combined modality therapy; female; follow-up studies; humans; kidney neoplasms; male; middle aged; neoplasm recurrence, local; nephrectomy; radiotherapy dosage; time factors",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,"Frydenberg, M.

Between 1986 and 1990, data were obtained at five US clinical centers on 253 patients with idiopathic retinal detachment and 1,138 controls. Patients with pathologic myopia were excluded. Data were collected from interviews, clinical examinations, and laboratory analyses of blood samples. Only one clearly relevant risk factor, myopia, emerged from the analyses. An eye with a spherical equivalent refractive error of -1 to -3 diopters had a fourfold increased risk of retinal detachment compared with a nonmyopic eye if the refractive error was greater than -3 diopters, the risk was increased 10-fold. The data suggest that almost 55% of nontraumatic detachments in eyes without previous surgery are attributable to myopia.

A latex glove was rinsed with 10 cc of distilled water and the resulting solution, used as a spray, brought on a bronchospasm in the first two minutes. This bronchial provocation test proves that latex can cause asthma-type dyspnea when work involves contact with the substance. The speed of onset and intensity of the respiratory symptoms observed show that such a provocation test must be carried out with extreme care in patients with a marked sensitivity to latex.

Seventy-five (7.6%) patent grafts failed to achieve a healed foot despite exhaustive attempts to do so and these patients underwent major amputation either above the knee (AKA) or below the knee (BKA). In 525 femoro-popliteal bypasses, there were 38 major amputations (29 BKA AKA) with a patent graft in 462 femoro-distal bypasses, there were 37 amputations (22 BKA 15 AKA) with a patent graft. The remaining 912 patients with limb salvage as well as all the patients with limb loss were evaluated with regard to systemic risk factors, quality of the run-off from the popliteal artery, continuity of the tibial artery into the arch as demonstrated on arteriography, the haemodynamic improvement obtained postoperatively, and the presence and extent of necrosis in the foot. The presence of diabetes, extensive pedal necrosis and advanced infection predispose to limb loss despite a patent lower extremity bypass graft. Patients who lost their limbs despite a functioning bypass to an isolated popliteal segment had significantly less pronounced haemodynamic improvement postoperatively. An early graft extension to a reconstituted tibial or peroneal artery or a direct bypass to a distal tibial or peroneal artery may reduce the incidence of limb loss in this setting. When a patent bypass to an isolated tibial or peroneal artery segment failed to relieve foot ischaemia, limb salvage was achieved by a distal extension to plantar arteries.",1990,1990-08-01,44,European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery,"amputation; anastomosis, surgical; foot; hemodynamics; humans; infections; leg; multicenter studies as topic; necrosis; risk factors; ultrasonography; vascular patency",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,"Dietzek, A.M.

The vessels were divided into the operated and nonoperated segments of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries, and both intraoperative image and flow data were tabulated by artery segment. The technical factors that were analyzed included defect size, defect type, adjacent segment defects, number of defects, shunt use, vessel reopening, and peak, mean, and end-diastolic frequency and velocity. The systemic risk factors studied were sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, randomly drawn total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and perioperative aspirin and dextran use. Data were analyzed by linear logistic regression analysis. Among the technical factors, only intraoperative defect size was significantly associated with risk of recurrent stenosis (p 0.0175). Although any defect size adversely affected the condition of the vessel during follow-up, the magnitude of this effect was small for smaller defects (size category 1: less than or equal to 40% stenosis or flap length less than or equal to 25% of vessel diameter). The systemic factors that were associated with risk of recurrent stenosis were hypertension (p 0.0002), smoking (p 0.0016), and randomly drawn total serum cholesterol level (p 0.0116). The fact that the operated segments consistently fared worse during follow-up than did the nonoperated segments (p 0.0044) undoubtedly reflects the inevitable trauma of the endarterectomy, but also emphasizes the important contribution of systemic risk factors in recurrent carotid stenosis.

At variance with the classical concept of trials, a clinical epidemiological interest came first: The comparison between drugs was considered a main target of the investigation only within that broader framework, and was explicitly formulated as the direct confrontation between two concepts or two generations of thrombolysis. A selective, highly efficient, and specific new thrombolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is compared with streptokinase with the expectation that the more selective approach could enhance the benefits of specificity, drastically limiting the systemic risks aspects (hemorrhagic complications).

Radiologists and vascular surgeons independently assessed index lesions on arteriograms to decide whether their respective treatments were appropriate. Of 263 male patients randomized, 255 received vascular intervention (surgery, 126 patients PTA, 129 patients). The groups were comparable when stratified for systemic risk factors and anatomic distribution of disease. Because eligibility criteria required that all lesions randomized for treatment be suitable for PTA, the severity of disease was less than that of the general population having vascular disease. Claudication was the principal indication for intervention. The immediate failure rate for PTA was 15.5% (20 of 129 patients). Surgery was performed with one in-hospital death (0.8%) and 17 complications (13.5%). There were two late deaths ascribable to surgical complications and none to PTA. At 4.5 years, 50 deaths (20%) (28 from surgery 22 with PTA) and 24 major amputations of legs included in the study (13 with surgery 11 with PTA) have occurred.

"Töpert, M.",Perspectives in corticosteroid research,"In dermatotherapy, potent drugs are needed which can be used as alternatives to corticosteroids, but which are without unwanted local and systemic effects. Three theoretical possibilities for the development of such advanced drugs have been presented.Firstly, dissociation of wanted and unwanted effects by selection of a certain corticosteroid structure is proposed. However, this is impossible, because corticosteroid receptors are ubiquitous and all display the same specificity.Secondly, manipulation of the pathways of the inflammatory response may be more feasible. Because of increasing knowledge of the mechanism of inflammation and the pathogenesis of cutaneous inflammatory diseases, it is predictable that effective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for topical use will be developed some time in the future.Lastly, the effects and side effects can now be limited to the site of application, thus avoiding systemic risks, by optimising corticosteroid activity with respect to receptor binding and pharmacokinetic properties.However, it is realistic to assume that, even in the future, corticosteroids will always possess both desirable and undesirable properties.",1988,1988-11-01,18,Drugs,"administration, topical; adrenal cortex hormones; anti-inflammatory agents; anti-inflammatory agents, non-steroidal; humans; skin diseases",32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,"Töpert, M.

We have developed a microcomputer-based data handling system for evaluating vascular patients that is inexpensive ($6000 to $8000), easy to use, and flexible. Its simplicity for nonprogrammers is achieved through a natural interface with menu-driven operations and descriptive English language messages. With this system eight data entry forms were designed, and data on more than 1000 patients treated for peripheral vascular disease over the lastyears were entered into the computer by clerical personnel with minimal training. A query language report generator allowed us to obtain reports of in simple English on any set of selection criteria with all relevant statistical functions, including cumulative life-table patency rates. This system has the following advantages: rapid evaluation of data from several retrospective and prospective studies, such as comparison of graft material, effect of local and systemic risk factors, cost of limb-salvage surgery, and correlation of noninvasive laboratory tests with other parameters more accurate patient follow-up, with elimination of many of the pitfalls involved in observing large groups of patients frequently and quantitation of individual surgeon or service for quality control and self-review, which guide the vascular surgeon to modify treatment protocols, patient selection, and or surgical techniques.

"Seiler, J.P.",The mutagenicity of mono and di-functional aromatic glycidyl compounds,"Although epoxides are very important compounds in today's technology, they are not as well investigated for their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties as their economical importance would suggest. The present study tried, on one hand, to bridge the gap between microbial testing of such compounds and the in vivo mammalian test system. On the other hand, the comparative testing of structurally related substances was expected to yield some clues as to the structural determinants of possible in vivo mutagenic activity. Our investigations withcompounds of similar structure, namely glycidylmethylaniline (GMA), diglycidylaniline (DGA), phenylglycidylether (PGE), and resorcinol diglycidyl ether (RDGE), first demonstrated that, in bacterial assays, allepoxides acted as potent mutagens. Only thedifunctional epoxides, however, were active in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with CHO cells. That such in vitro cannot be supposed to represent the in vivo situation is again demonstrated by discovery that only one of the two in vitro active substances (and in fact it is the less active one) also has a damaging effect in vivo. It, therefore, seems quite justifiable to conclude that two structural features must be combined in an aromatic glycidyl compound if it is to exert chromosome damaging activity in vivo: The substance must possessepoxy functions, and they must be bound to the aromatic nucleus by an aminic nitrogen. The industrial use of aromatic glycidyl ethers might, therefore, be considered not to pose a great systemic risk for mutagenicity or carcinogenicity, without completely excluding the possibility of local effects.",1984,1984-03-01,27,Mutation Research/fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis,"animals; bone marrow; cell nucleus; chromosomes; epoxy compounds; erythrocytes; ethers, cyclic; mice; mice, inbred strains; mutagenicity tests; mutagens; mutation; salmonella typhimurium; structure-activity relationship",31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,"Seiler, J.P.
