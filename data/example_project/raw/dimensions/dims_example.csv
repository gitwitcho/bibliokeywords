Although acutely glucocorticoids suppress inflammation, chronic glucocorticoid excess worsens atherosclerosis, possibly by exacerbating systemic cardiovascular risk factors. However, glucocorticoid action within the lesion may reduce neointimal proliferation and inflammation. Glucocorticoid levels within cells do not necessarily reflect circulating levels due to pre-receptor metabolism by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs). 11β-HSD2 converts active glucocorticoids into inert 11-keto forms. 11β-HSD1 catalyses the reverse reaction, regenerating active glucocorticoids. 11β-HSD2-deficiency/ inhibition causes hypertension, whereas deficiency/ inhibition of 11β-HSD1 generates a cardioprotective lipid profile and improves glycemic control. Importantly, 11β-HSD1-deficiency/ inhibition is atheroprotective, whereas 11β-HSD2-deficiency accelerates atherosclerosis. These effects are largely independent of systemic risk factors, reflecting modulation of glucocorticoid action and inflammation within the vasculature. Here, we consider whether evidence linking the 11β-HSDs to vascular inflammation suggests these isozymes are potential therapeutic targets in vascular injury and atherosclerosis.","The authors are grateful to The Wellcome Trust, The British Heart Foundation and the BHF CoRE for supporting their research.",,Current Atherosclerosis Reports,,Springer Nature,"1523-3804, 1534-6242",11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2; Atherosclerosis; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Neointima; Vasculitis,2013-03-20,2013,2013-03-20,2013-05,15,5,320,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Hadoke, Patrick W.

Events from the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the Greek sovereign debt crisis demonstrate the urgent and abiding need for statistical tools adequate to measure and anticipate the amplitude of potential swings in the financial markets—from ordinary stock price and interest rate moves, to defaults, to those increasingly frequent ""rare events"" fashionably called black swan events. Yet many on Wall Street continue to rely on standard models based on artificially simplified assumptions that can lead to systematic (and sometimes catastrophic) underestimation of real risks. In Practical Methods of Financial Engineering and Risk Management, Dr. Rupak Chatterjee— former director of the multi-asset quantitative research group at Citi—introduces finance professionals and advanced students to the latest concepts, tools, valuation techniques, and analytic measures being deployed by the more discerning and responsive Wall Street practitioners, on all operational scales from day trading to institutional strategy, to model and analyze more faithfully the real behavior and risk exposure of financial markets in the cold light of the post-2008 realities. Until one masters this modern skill set, one cannot allocate risk capital properly, price and hedge derivative securities realistically, or risk-manage positions from the multiple perspectives of market risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, and systemic risk. The book assumes a working knowledge of calculus, statistics, and Excel, but it teaches techniques from statistical analysis, probability, and stochastic processes sufficient to enable the reader to calibrate probability distributions and create the simulations that are used on Wall Street to valuate various financial instruments correctly, model the risk dimensions of trading strategies, and perform the numerically intensive analysis of risk measures required by various regulatory agencies.",,,,,Springer Nature,,,2014,2014,,2014,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Chatterjee, Rupak","Chatterjee, Rupak ()",,"Chatterjee, Rupak ()",,,,,,,,,,,10,1,,3.64,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023259046,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

These crises (new technology bubbles, the sub‐prime crisis …) have led economists and financial analysts to the following conclusions. First of all, systemic risk has increased during the last 30 years, which had led regulators to devise rules to evaluate information more efficiently. Second, the recent collapse of stock markets despite the national rescue measures shows the importance of preventative procedures. The third point is that aggressive capitalism has demonstrated its limits. The aim of this paper is to show that regulation is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensure the efficiency of banking institutions, financial markets and the management of companies.    Design/methodology/approach  Through the analysis of the Swiss banking sector, the paper provides an insight for banks to satisfy social pressure on more ethical behavior. This case could be an example for another functioning for financial institutions.    Findings  By refocusing on their core business, banking institutions will be capable of realizing profit and creating value for the community.    Practical implications  The arguments discussed in this paper could be of interest both for professionals and academics willing to solve the antagonism between profit and ethics: profit can be compatible with social value added.    Originality/value  Banking and finance is not “an ethics free zone”. By changing their behavior, banks can improve their credibility on the market and renew the confidence towards clients.",,,Corporate Governance,,Emerald,"1472-0701, 1758-6054",,2011-06-14,2011,,2011-06-14,11,3,293-300,Closed,Article,"Paulet, Elisabeth","Paulet, Elisabeth (ESCEM, Poitiers, France)",,"Paulet, Elisabeth (School of Business and Management)",School of Business and Management,grid.462193.b,Tours,,France,,,,,,14,3,,4.23,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024295806,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims
285,pub.1142646453,10.2139/ssrn.2198789,,,,Trade Imbalances and Multilateral Trade Cooperation,"Rising current account and merchandise trade imbalances marked the years before the global financial and economic crisis. These imbalances either contributed to or precipitated the crisis and to the extent that they create systemic risks, it is desirable that they be reduced. There are many factors related to macroeconomic, structural, exchange rate and financial policies that contributed to the imbalances. The inability to manage these issues at the international level reflects the “coherence gap” in global governance. This paper examines the contribution that the WTO can make in its three areas of activities — negotiations, rule-making and dispute settlement — to deal with trade imbalances and with the main factors leading to them, including exchange rate misalignments. First, market opening efforts in services, including in the area of financial services, can reduce policy-related distortions and market imperfections in surplus countries that lead to the build-up of unsustainable imbalances. Second, in the context of a broad international effort to coordinate macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies to deal with the roots of imbalances (the first-best solution), there is a general efficiency argument that could be made for the use of WTO-triggered trade actions to enforce cooperative behaviour towards rebalancing. Absent this first-best response, trade rules alone would not provide an efficient instrument to compensate for the weaknesses in international co-operation in macroeconomic, exchange rate and structural policies.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2012,2012,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Marchetti, Juan A.; Ruta, Michele; Teh, Robert","Marchetti, Juan A.

We find that a bank’s systemic risk level is a possible reason for CoCo issuance. Contrary to the pecking order theory, earnings management practices play a lesser role, and there is no evidence of banks becoming riskier after issuing CoCos. However, we find systemically riskier banks are more likely to issue CoCos. Thus, riskier banks may be utilising CoCo loss absorption mechanisms to partially internalise the costs of future loan losses. If banks are issuing such instruments without regulatory prompting, then an issuance may signal the need to provide greater oversight. Conversely, if such issuances do result from regulatory prompting, then banks may be engaging in risk management strategies, minimising their cost of equity issuance.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Williams, Barry; Tan, Shao Lei; Fenech, Jean-Pierre","Williams, Barry (Department of Banking and Finance; Financial Research Network (FIRN)); Tan, Shao Lei (Monash University - Department of Banking and Finance); Fenech, Jean-Pierre (Monash University; Financial Research Network (FIRN))",,"Williams, Barry (); Tan, Shao Lei (Monash University); Fenech, Jean-Pierre ()",Monash University,grid.1002.3,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105370938,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

However, most of the countries implementing this instrument in recent years are not following its signals due to the large downward biases that it is presenting after the last financial crisis that do not reflect properly the current macrofinancial environment. In this context, credit gap measures that incorporate economic fundamentals may provide more accurate signals of cyclical systemic risk. We propose two alternative model-based indicators that account for these factors. We assess their performance using time series data from the 1970s for six European countries and compare them to the Basel gap. We find that our proposed models provide more accurate early warning signals of the build-up of cyclical systemic risk than the Basel gap, as well as lower biases after rapid changes in fundamentals. Furthermore, we identify the model specifications that are optimal for each of the countries considered. Our flexible approach can easily accommodate national specificities, which are key to maximize the performance of the models.","We thank Mikael Juselius and the colleagues of the working groups of the European Central Bank where this study has been discussed for their useful comments and suggestions.

To identify feedback loops, the European Systemic Risk Board has developed macroprudential surveys that ask banks and insurers how they would behave in a macroeconomic stress scenario. In a pilot application of these surveys, we find evidence of herding behaviour in the banking sector, notably concerning credit retrenchment. Results show that the consequences can be large, potentially undoing the initial effects of banks’ remedial actions by worsening their solvency position. In contrast, insurers’ responses to the survey provide little evidence of herding in response to macroeconomic stress.

Banks increasingly used short-term debt during the lending boom before the last financial crisis. This caused distortions in the asset price and triggered the excessive asset growth in the market. The increase in the short-term borrowing also raised the interconnectedness of the financial institutions and led to systemic risk. In order to achieve a stable financial system, the amount of short-term debt needs to be regulated. In this paper, I explore the welfare effects of a regulatory quantity limit on short-term debt. The preliminary results show that a quantity restriction on short-term borrowing is welfare improving during the expansion when the investors are optimistic. However, it is welfare decreasing during the recession when the investors are pessimistic. Therefore, the regulatory limit on short-term borrowing should be cyclical: lower during expansions and higher during recessions.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,1556-5068,,2011-12,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Neef, H.

A simple theoretical model of shock transfer is built to investigate some stylized facts on how firm-idiosyncratic shocks are allocated in the network, and how this allocation changes firm default probabilities. The model shows that the network works as a perfect “risk-pooling” mechanism, when it is both strongly connected and symmetric. But the “risk-sharing” does not necessarily reduce default rates, unless the shock firms face is lower on average than their financial capacity.

Since then, the concept has been refined and the analytical tools for estimating such losses have advanced markedly (RMS, 1996; Rose et al., 1995). Yet despite such advancements, indirect loss remains a somewhat amorphous concept. In contrast to what was once believed, it does not readily yield simple rules of thumb, e. g., “indirect loss is equivalent in magnitude to direct loss.” In fact, it has since been learned that indirect loss can vary dramatically, and under some circumstances may even prove to be negative implying regional net gains (negative losses). This Chapter provides: a conceptual framework for analyzing indirect loss, a brief description of an algorithm for calculating such loss, a discussion of the range of post disaster outcomes that might be expected, and a brief review of the evidence.

However, the Euler allocation scheme of the risk measure VaR meets the desirable property of portfolio-invariance only under the asymptotically single-risk-factor model (ASRF) framework. Without portfolio-invariance, the marginal capital contribution of a sector can be different when the composition of other sectors in the portfolio varies. This study proposes an approximated portfolio-invariant Euler allocation scheme of VaR in an asymptotically fine-grained portfolio under the Merton-type multi-factor (multi-sector) framework by adopting the response surface methodology (RSM). In the proposed scheme, to account for the concentration risk, a second-order canonical polynomial that approximates the risk measure VaR over the entire region where the sectors’ exposure weights are defined is estimated. Comparisons are made between the proposed RSM approach to two other approximated Euler allocation schemes in a seven-sector environment. It is hoped the proposed RSM can provide a sound capital allocation scheme under a multi-systemic-risk-factor environment to overcome the general critique of the revised Basel II based on the single-risk-factor framework.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kao, Lie-Jane","Kao, Lie-Jane (Kainan University)",,"Kao, Lie-Jane (Kainan University)",Kainan University,grid.445087.a,Taoyuan City,,Taiwan,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102415463,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

After an introduction to hedge funds and the reasons for regulating them, it considers the possible elements of a transnational regulatory regime for hedge funds: transnational industry self-regulation, including such induced by the government, regulatory competition between government regulators, and harmonisation of government regulation. The main conclusions are: self-regulation cannot substitute fully for government regulation in controlling systemic risks caused by hedge funds. Equally, regulatory competition tends to undercut systemic risk regulation. Effective transnational regulation can only be accomplished through harmonisation of government regulation. Such harmonisation is likely to arise if regulation is needed to control systemic risk in global financial markets.",,,European Business Organization Law Review,,Springer Nature,"1566-7529, 1741-6205",,2010-09,2010,2015-02-28,2010-09,11,3,329-378,Closed,Article,"Engert, Andreas","Engert, Andreas (Business Law and Tax Law, University of Mannheim, Germany)","Engert, Andreas (University of Mannheim)","Engert, Andreas (University of Mannheim)",University of Mannheim,grid.5601.2,Mannheim,,Germany,,,,,,10,2,,11.86,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054941153,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law,,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

During the last twenty years, there has been increasing allocation of active and passive investment capital to such countries that have excessive numbers of outstanding shares – the main issue is that such markets are structurally and behaviorally different from “normal” markets, a fact that is often omitted by active and passive managers. Also, there has been increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in portfolio management (both active and passive), and for modeling of agents, preferences and statistical relationships in market microstructure analysis, yet such studies often omit behavioral and structural issues that render such models ineffective. The article contributes to the literature by explaining the following, many of which have not been addressed at all or in detail in the literature: i) there may be a symbiotic relationship between institutionalized earnings management and corporate governance deficiencies on one hand, and the excessive outstanding shares phenomenon; ii) the number of issuers’ outstanding shares can have significant impact on investor behavior, and a broad range of corporate governance metrics, managerial behavior, incentive-effects and systemic risk – thus having excessive numbers of outstanding shares can distort Artificial Intelligence (AI) based trading or market microstructure models; iii) the incentive effects of employee incentives and managerial behavior can change as a result of excessive numbers of outstanding shares, and the relationship is symbiotic; iv) the Law-of-Large-Numbers is not correct in all circumstances, and is precluded when there is an excessive number of outstanding shares.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Nwogugu, Michael C.

CCPs contribute to a reduction of systemic risk. The global clearing volume of OTC interest rate, equity and currency derivatives is approximately USD 400 trillion per year. In light of the upcoming Brexit, the question arises as to whether or not the clearing of euro denominated OTC derivatives, currently performed primarily by the London based clearing house LCH Clearnet, should remain in the UK due to economies of scale available to LCH Clearnet as the current European market leader. On the other hand, CCPs are of increasing importance for financial stability in the eurozone, particularly because of potential spillover effects on monetary policy if a systemically important CCP experiences financial distress. Hence, a relocation of euro OTC derivatives clearing from the UK to the EU would ensure direct supervision by European authorities. Opponents of a relocation are concerned about decreasing market liquidity and capital efficiency alongside higher transaction costs due to market fragmentation. The analysis presented in this paper shows that the existing relocation cost estimates of up to USD 100 billion are far too high; realistically, they can be expected to amount to just USD 3.2 billion over a period of five years.",,,Wirtschaftsdienst,,Springer Nature,"0043-6275, 1613-978X",,2018-04-19,2018,2018-04-19,2018-04,98,4,267-275,All OA; Green,Article,"Brühl, Volker","Brühl, Volker (Center for Financial Studies, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Theodor-W.-Adorno-Platz 3, 60323, Frankfurt, Deutschland)","Brühl, Volker (Goethe University Frankfurt)","Brühl, Volker (Goethe University Frankfurt)",Goethe University Frankfurt,grid.7839.5,Frankfurt am Main,Hessen,Germany,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213643/1/267-275-Bruehl.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103461006,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

But today the focus is on narrowly defined portfolio metrics with the associated disinterest in systemic risks, unless there is regulatory pressure. The only way to mitigate the risks associated with CCD is to prevent CCD. Waiting for proof of exactly how important neonicotinoids are is a weak strategy since such proof is unlikely to emerge in time.

We map these hypotheses into a two-stage hierarchical testing framework, combining insights from the early-warning literature on financial crises with recent advances on growth-at-risk. Applying this framework to a set of candidate variables, we find that the Basel III credit-to-GDP gap does not indicate systemic risk coherently across G7 countries. Credit growth and house price growth also do not pass our test in many cases. By contrast, a composite financial cycle signals systemic risk consistently for all countries except Canada. Overall, our results suggest that systemic risk may be consistently measured only once the turning points of indicators have been observed. Therefore, pre-emptive countercyclical macroprudential policy may smooth the financial cycle in boom phases, which then indirectly mitigates the amount of systemic risk in the future.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hartwig, Benny; Meinerding, Christoph; Schüler, Yves S.","Hartwig, Benny (Goethe University Frankfurt; European Central Bank); Meinerding, Christoph (Deutsche Bundesbank); Schüler, Yves S.

To understand the consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian war on the West, as well as to anticipate and counteract a possible future evolution of similar events not only in geopolitical risk states such as Moldavia, but also even in NATO members such as the Baltic countries, Romania or Bulgaria, it is worth paying attention to the geopolitical consequences of the loss of Crimea and the South-Eastern provinces by Ukraine. The article analyses the reason, mechanisms and stakes behind the Russian-Ukrainian war, from both a geopolitical and historical perspective. To understand the way in which different hybrid instruments can be used by the Russian Federation to influence the States in its proximity and, in particular, how their combination leads to effective satisfaction of the aims, it is useful to assess and address the systemic risks and vulnerabilities of States in the concerned areas of Russia and the West in recent years.

Global 4C offers a financial reward for mitigation and aims to internalise a Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) into the economy. Carbon taxes (i.e. carbon prices) are essential for internalising the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), however a SCC-RCC duality is inferred with an epistemological method and is supported with a new hypothesis, called the Holistic Market Hypothesis. Based on the inferred SCC-RCC duality, a system of complementary market pricing is proposed as an effective response to emerging climate systemic risk and fat-tailed probability distributions for the Earth's climate sensitivity. The recommended policy instrument is a currency, called Complementary Currencies for Climate Change (4C). 4C should be priced in foreign exchange currency markets (Forex) to mirror the RCC and to incentivise a spectrum of mitigation services, including clean renewable energy and carbon sequestration. A public broadcast message for climate systemic risk should be made each year, in the form of a ‘100-year advance 4C price alert’, which is an assurance of reward prices for carbon mitigation (i.e. the 4C exchange rate) under a Carbon Exchange Standard (CES).

284,pub.1025391637,10.1057/jbr.2012.10,,,,Cross-border banking supervision: Incentive conflicts in supervisory information sharing between home and host supervisors,"The Basel Committee has been active in the area of cross-border banking supervision since its establishment now more than 30 years ago. Despite its longstanding efforts to promote better cooperation among prudential banking supervisors, the crisis has confirmed that individual supervisors ignore the impact of their decisions on financial stability in other jurisdictions. It has also highlighted the systemic risks host supervisors whose financial systems are dominated by foreign banks face. Many of these risks originate from the numerous incentive distortions between home and host supervisors. International bodies such as the G20, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee have responded in a concerted effort and publicly promoted better cooperation, particularly through the use of supervisory colleges and the establishment of cross-border crisis management groups.

What is needed is a rigorous analysis to ensure the right incentives for home and host supervisors are in place at every stage of the supervision and resolution process.

We take the stand that systemic risk increases when the larger players in the financial sector have a larger share of the output. Our calculations indicate that the cost to the economy as a whole due to increased systemic risk is of an order of magnitude larger than the potential benefits due to any economies of scale when banks are allowed to be large. When distributional and inter generational transfer issues are taken into account, the potential benefits to economies of scale are unlikely to ever exceed the potential costs due to increased risk of financial crisis.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2012,2012,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Heitz, Amanda Rae; Boyd, John H.","Heitz, Amanda Rae (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Boyd, John H.

It is pointed out that uncontrolled capital flows pose a special threat to small open economies due to insufficient development of the institutional environment and low depth of financial markets. There has been constructed circle of typical for small open economies risks, conducted with uncontrolled capital flows movement, such as deepening structural imbalances in financial asset markets, undesirable excessive fluctuations in the national currency rate, the flight of national capital and the erosion of the tax base. Based on the analysis of recent research, international regulatory initiatives of EU countries, recommendations of international development institutions and IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework, have been identified such trends as strengthening control over illegal capital flows, limiting of the negative speculative influence, panic and herd behaviour on exchange rate stability. Argued for a very important role which plays an uncontrolled dynamics of national currency rate on the transmission of global shocks to national economies. This necessitates a serious overhaul of exchange rate policy approaches. Central banks of small open economies should consider exchange rate stability as one of their goals. This does not mean inflation targeting abandon. The use of the instrument of currency interventions helps to influence the achievement of external targets, increasing the ability of interest rate policy instruments to achieve inflation targeting in the domestic market as well. As a conclusion and proposals for further development of policies in the financial sector to ensure the sustainable development of small open economies is systematized a list of possible regulatory measures. It is emphasized that the development of regulatory policies in the monetary and financial spheres in small open economies, which includes Ukraine, should be implemented comprehensively and include the development of macroprudential tools to limit systemic risk factors, suppress illicit capital flows and reduce the role of psychological factors of pro-cyclical behavior. The implementation of regulatory measures on transparent terms in such spheres will not make free-market self-regulatory mechanisms weaken, but rather helps to release them.",,,Economics & Education,,Publishing House Baltija Publishing,"2500-946X, 2592-8236",,2021-08-27,2021,2021-08-27,,6,2,58-62,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Bublyk, Yevhen","Bublyk, Yevhen (State Organization “Institute of Economics and Forecasting of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine”, Ukraine)",,"Bublyk, Yevhen ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,http://baltijapublishing.lv/index.php/econedu/article/download/1224/1263,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141779692,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The derivatives market has been the subject of structural reforms which have involved both the post-trade—Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012 (‘EMIR’)—and the trading phase—Directive 2014/65/EU (‘MiFID II’) and Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 (‘MiFIR’). In particular, the post-crisis regulation is characterized by the increasing role of the EU authorities both as a supervisor and as a regulator. The paper focuses on the role of ESMA in light of its new intervention powers. This paper analyses the regulations on over-the-counter derivatives introduced in Europe, with the goal of underlining the costs and benefits of this approach. To fully achieve its objective, the paper proposes, in the first section, a logical path that starts from an overview of the regulatory response to the crisis; then, in the second section, it focuses on ESMA’s growing role in light of the recent reforms. The third section points out the strengths and weaknesses of the law-making process with a particular reference to a highly technical topic. Finally, the analysis concludes by speculating on the potential ‘Brexit’ impact on the ESMA’s reform proposal, due to the role played by financial institutions and the activism of interested Member States.","I am grateful to Professor Andrea Perrone for his precious comments and to Professor Danny Busch for discussions on this topic during my Visiting Period at the Financial Institute—Radboud University, Nijmegen.

In this paper, a risk contagion model including the OTC derivatives market and the interbank market is built, and the effects of introducing non-central clearing on systemic risk of banks is studied by using the data in the Balance Sheet of banks in China in 2017. The results show that the introduction of non-central clearing does not necessarily reduce systemic risk. Under low impact conditions, systemic risk and the number of defaulting banks under non-central clearing conditions are smaller than that without non-central clearing. Under extreme conditions, systemic risk and the number of defaulting banks are larger than that without non-central clearing when the central clearing proportion is low. Under both conditions, increasing the central clearing proportion can reduce systemic risk and the number of defaulting banks. The network structure of the OTC derivatives market and the interbank market will affect systemic risk. Systemic risk and the number of defaulting banks will decrease with the increase of the network density, and the existence of large risk exposure will significantly increase systemic risk and the number of defaulting banks.","This research is supported by NSFC, China (No. 71671037; No. 71971055), The 16th Batch of “Six Talents Peak” High-level Talent Projects in Jiangsu Province, China (No. JY-004) and Social Science Fund Project of Jiangsu Province, China (No. 19GLC005).",,Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,,Elsevier,"0378-4371, 1873-2119",,2020-03,2020,,2020-03,541,,123325,Closed,Article,"Wang, Hu; Li, Shouwei","Wang, Hu (School of Economics and Management, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China; Research Center for Financial Complexity and Risk Management, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China); Li, Shouwei (School of Economics and Management, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China; Research Center for Financial Complexity and Risk Management, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China; School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 211189, China)","Li, Shouwei (Southeast University; Southeast University; Southeast University)","Wang, Hu (Southeast University; Southeast University); Li, Shouwei (Southeast University; Southeast University; Southeast University)",Southeast University,grid.263826.b,Nanjing,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8870447; grant.8324580,71971055; 71671037,6,5,,4.98,2.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122298562,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4902 Mathematical Physics,Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

The effectiveness of monetary policy and alarmingly wide interest rate spread has been a contentious issue in the corridors of central banks across the globe in this lifetime. This has been largely because monetary policy alone proved to be less efficient in mitigating the effects of systemic risk, particularly during the 2007 financial crisis, necessitating the need for macro-prudential banking regulation. Time series dataset spanning from 1994Q1 to 2016Q4 is employed to carry out this study using the restricted Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, that is, the Vector Error Correctional Model (VECM). The results show that there is no long-run causality running from trade openness, real exchange rate financial depth interest rate spread and credit growth to the repo rate in South Africa. A short run causality running from credit growth to the repo rate exists from the estimated model. In addition, the empirical results exhibited evidence that interest rate spread has a dampening effect on monetary policy but in the long-run this effect seems reversible in South Africa. Therefore, in order to ensure financial stability, care has to be taken by the South African Reserve Bank and government in choosing the best tool-kit of macro-prudential banking regulation as it can be used to disguise the symptoms of a lax monetary policy framework.",,,Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies,,AMH International Conferences and Seminars Organizing LLC,2220-6140,,2019-01-16,2019,2019-01-16,,10,6A,141-151,All OA; Gold,Article,"Batsirai, Shayanewako Varaidzo; Tsegaye, Asrat; Khamfula, Yohane","Batsirai, Shayanewako Varaidzo (); Tsegaye, Asrat (); Khamfula, Yohane ()",,"Batsirai, Shayanewako Varaidzo (); Tsegaye, Asrat (); Khamfula, Yohane ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://ojs.amhinternational.com/index.php/jebs/article/download/2670/1789,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111527482,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

An Assessment,"Motivated by the current discussion on different separate banking systems, we provide an overview of the different systems, question them and outline their effect on systemic stability and the German banking sector. The results show that the various separate banking systems only play a minor role in reducing and limiting systemic risk. They only marginally contribute to solving conflicts of interest and can even be detrimental to banking business diversification. A separate banking system could, however, facilitate banking supervision by reducing the banking system’s complexity.

We investigate a one-period borrower-lender network with no dynamics, in which all debts are due at the same time and have the same seniority. Every node in the network represents a financial institution, and every node is labeled with a nonnegative real number which is the cash on hand that the institution has before the debts are due. If node i owes d dollars to node j, this is represented in the network as a directed edge from node i to node j with weight d. We propose a duality-based distributed algorithm to determine the optimal cash injection amount C and its corresponding optimal allocation among the nodes, to minimize the cost function C+λD which is a linear combination of two terms: the total cash injected into the system and the total unpaid liabilities D in the system after the cash injection.

The authors analyze the importance for such a standard of software that turns natural language contracts into cash flow generating algorithms; a data dictionary that standardizes contract terms; and access to variables that represent the state of the world (e.g. market risk, counterparty risk, etc.) that affect contractual obligations. The ability to realize benefits from the use of such a contract level algorithmic standard depends on the following: making the standard’s software open source; fully testing the software to have complete confidence in its accuracy; and enabling the software to use of a wide range of models of various sources of risk (market, credit and behavior risk) to support forward-looking analysis. Such a standard would solve the disconnect that exists in financial firms between the representation of financial contracts for transaction processing and analysis. The ACTUS Financial Research Foundation is building, testing and making available such a standard that represents almost all financial contracts extant in markets. The adoption of such a standard would reduce the costs of operations of financial firms, provide the computational infrastructure for more effective regulatory oversight, reduce regulatory reporting costs and improve financial market transparency. It would also enable the assessment of systemic risk by directly quantifying the interconnectedness of firms. This is a new approach to financial analytics that clearly separates the deterministic components of finance, which can be standardized from the stochastic elements that cannot be standardized.",,,The Journal of Risk Finance,,Emerald,"0965-7967, 1758-4086, 1526-5943",,2018-01-15,2018,,2018-01-15,19,1,76-92,Closed,Article,"Brammertz, Willi; Mendelowitz, Allan I.","Brammertz, Willi (ACTUS Users Association, Rockville, Maryland, USA, and Ariadne Business Analytics, Naenikon, Switzerland); Mendelowitz, Allan I.

Ahead of the crisis (2005–07), results suggest that bank complexity materially reduces systemic risk and enhances stability, as it encourages banks to take on more diversified risks. While such a relation is inverted during the crisis (2008–11) and after the crisis (2012–13), consistent with the view that, during distress times, international banks have less ability to monitor cross-border risks. Further evidence show that, regardless of the period, the effect of complexity on systemic risk is accentuated for ‘too-big-too-fail’ banks and banks with strong activity diversity. Conversely, complex banks with merger-acquisition history and banks operating networks of foreign branches mitigate systemic risk during the acute crisis and the later stage of the crisis, respectively.

In this paper, we exploit this change in information gathering behavior by utilizing Google query volumes as a ""bad news"" indicator for each corporation listed in the Standard and Poor´s 100 index. Our results provide not only an investment strategy that gains particularly in times of financial turmoil and extensive losses by other market participants, but reveal new sectoral patterns between mass online behavior and (bearish) stock market movements. Based on collective attention shifts in search queries for individual companies, hence, these findings can help to identify early warning signs of financial systemic risk. However, our disaggregated data also illustrate the need for further efforts to understand the influence of collective attention shifts on financial behavior in times of regular market activities with less tremendous changes in search volumes.","The author has no support or funding to report.

Also, the cost of cybercrime at financial institutions outpaces the cost of cybercrime in other industries. For example, according to a 2019 private study, the per-company cost of cybercrime is over $18 million for financial services companies, around 40% higher than the average cost for other sectors. If the entire system fails to address cybersecurity concerns adequately, this could lead to systemic risk – the risk that a cybersecurity incident would destabilize the financial system.

This paper proposes a new method to characterize the evolution and transition characteristics of the correlation modes for multivariate time series(ETCCMMTS). Based on ETCCMMTS, the characteristics of energy price systems are analyzed. The results show that energy price correlated modes exhibit co-movement, group-occurrence and the small-world property. The results prove that futures prices have the leading role, the crude oil futures price affects the stability of an energy price system, and the crude oil spot price has the highest clustering coefficient, whereas the heating oil futures price has the largest betweenness coefficient. The topological absorptive is introduced to measure the systemic risk, and the ”risk hopping” phenomenon is revealed. The recursive graph indicates that the fluctuations of energy price display not only short-range correlation for 1–2 months but also long-range correlation for 7–8 years. Additionally, the long-range correlation will lead to high systematic risk. In the course of energy price fluctuations, there is a total of 41 different types of correlation modes. The cumulative time of different correlation modes may result in a “cumulative time jump” and shows a linear growth in general. In addition, the topological structure of energy price correlated modal transition network (EPCMTN) is revealed.","The Research was supported by the following foundations: The Philosophy and Social Science Research Project in Colleges and Universities of Jiangsu Province, China (2018SJA2123), The National Natural Science Foundation of China (71503132, 71811520710, 11571142), Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province, China (2017), Six talent peaks project in Jiangsu Province, China (JY-055).",,Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,,Elsevier,"0378-4371, 1873-2119",,2019-07,2019,,2019-07,526,,120702,Closed,Article,"Xu, Hua; Wang, Minggang; Yang, Weiguo","Xu, Hua (Faculty of Science, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China; Taizhou College, Nanjing Normal University, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu, China); Wang, Minggang (School of Mathematical Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210042, Jiangsu, China; Taizhou College, Nanjing Normal University, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu, China); Yang, Weiguo (Faculty of Science, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212013, Jiangsu, China)","Wang, Minggang (Nanjing Normal University; Nanjing Normal University)","Xu, Hua (Jiangsu University; Nanjing Normal University); Wang, Minggang (Nanjing Normal University; Nanjing Normal University); Yang, Weiguo (Jiangsu University)",Nanjing Normal University; Jiangsu University,grid.260474.3; grid.440785.a,Nanjing; Zhenjiang,; ,China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8123996; grant.8868395; grant.8322354,11571142; 71811520710; 71503132,2,2,,1.37,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113404673,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4902 Mathematical Physics,,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy,dims

The modular structure of the framework allows to accommodate for a variety of shock scenarios, methods to estimate interbank exposures and mechanisms of distress propagation. The main features are as follows. First, the framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects (i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced in the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible fire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks on individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their vulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it includes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with familiar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform robustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a module for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are coherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration, we carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over the years 2008–2013. We find that second-round and third-round effects dominate first-round effects, therefore suggesting that most current stress-test frameworks might lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk.",,"SB and MD acknowledge support from the European Commission FET Open project SIMPOL nr. 610704, the European Commission FET Open DOLFINS nr. 640772, the European Commission ERC grant RMAC nr. 249415, and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) Professorship grant no.

The public health approach is invested with hope by those who are looking for an alternative to the punitive logic. Using a Foucaultian approach and a discourse analysis method, this research focuses on the way an anti-bullying intervention programme designed by a public health agency governs school bullying. The findings reveal two major logics at play. Firstly, the programme espouses the new public health model and, accordingly, governs bullying as a systemic risk rather than an individual problem. Secondly, the programme is also anchored in the classical punitive rationality. Public health and punitive logics, far from being mutually exclusive, are rather intertwined.

These themes—the synergies of ethical, normative and legal domain, the limits of traditional regulatory mechanisms, the role of socially and contextually constructed meaning, and the possibility of institutionalisation and normalisation of a culture of accountability, good governance and responsibility beyond instrumentalist compliance—are the common thread in the ensuing chapters.As the preceding chapters and the discussion of repeated cycles of crisis and regulatory response have sought to illustrate, merely instituting more laws and creating new authorities to oversee them will probably not be sufficient to prevent future transgressions. The incidences of acute and chronic fraudulent, malfeasant and unethical conduct in capital markets continue to occur seemingly unabated and notwithstanding the ever-increasing arsenal of laws, regulations and sanctions available to established government regulatory authorities around the world.Furthermore, as recriminations over the failure of existing regulatory agencies to identify and intervene in respect of activity posing risk to the financial and capital market system prompt governments to adopt new regulatory authorities, structures and mechanisms to identify and regulate systemic risk, it becomes clear that efforts to anticipate and react to the complexity of modern markets beget further complexity, the potential for unintended consequences, duplication and measures that may impose burdens and costs disproportionate to their intended goals.",,,,Evolutions in Corporate Governance - Towards an Ethical Framework for Business Conduct,Taylor & Francis,,,2013,2013,2013,,,,,Closed,Chapter,"Dempsey, Alison L.","Dempsey, Alison L.

However, shareholders are important for the governance of publicly held corporations today, because their holdings are concentrated in the hands of few institutional investors. Institutional investors can therefore have an impact on the sustainability of the largest companies in the world, as they often claim they do—particularly in communications with their beneficiaries. Whether institutional investors actually have such an impact is an open question. Recent changes in EU financial regulation aim to bring more clarity on this matter.

The proposed Vulnerability-CoVaR (VCoVaR) is defined as the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a financial system or institution, given that at least one other institution is equal or below its VaR. The VCoVaR relaxes normality assumptions and is estimated via copula. While important theoretical findings of the measure are detailed, the empirical study analyses how different distressing events of the cryptocurrencies impact the risk level of each other. The results show that Litecoin displays the largest impact on Bitcoin and that each cryptocurrency is significantly affected if an event of joint distress among the remaining market participants occurs.

We apply a weighted and directed network model to analyse the implications for default contagion and systemic risk under different stress testing scenarios. The empirical results indicate that the topology of the loan guarantee network is close to a ‘scale‐free’ structure, which is known to be robust against accidental failures but vulnerable to coordinated attacks. Hence, the network is able to cope with idiosyncratic shocks resulting from single company failures, but can easily suffer from more widespread contagion if a group of systemically important companies are hit by a targeted shock. We further demonstrate that within our sample of small and medium‐sized enterprise (SME) companies, increasing leverage reduces network stability and exacerbates the effects of contagion. More lenient bank lending policies increase the survival rate of sample companies and thereby reduce the losses from default contagion.",,,Accounting and Finance,,Wiley,"0810-5391, 1467-629X",,2019-10-31,2019,2019-10-31,2019-11,59,S2,1923-1946,Closed,Article,"Li, Wenwei; Ben, Shenglin; Hommel, Ulrich; Paterlini, Sandra; Yu, Jiefang","Li, Wenwei (Shanghai Gold Exchange, Shanghai, China; School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China); Ben, Shenglin (International Business School, Zhejiang University, Haining, China; Academy of Internet Finance, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China); Hommel, Ulrich (Department of Finance & Accounting, EBS Universität für Wirtschaft und Recht, Wiesbaden, Germany); Paterlini, Sandra (Department of Management and Economics, University of Trento, Trento, Italy); Yu, Jiefang (School of Economics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China)","Li, Wenwei (; Fudan University)","Li, Wenwei (Fudan University); Ben, Shenglin (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Hommel, Ulrich (EBS University of Business and Law); Paterlini, Sandra (University of Trento); Yu, Jiefang (Zhejiang University)",Fudan University; EBS University of Business and Law; University of Trento; Zhejiang University,grid.8547.e; grid.448648.2; grid.11696.39; grid.13402.34,Shanghai; Wiesbaden; Trento; Hangzhou,Shanghai; ; ; Zhejiang,China; Germany; Italy; China,,,,,,6,6,,3.46,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122195470,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Rogers and Zaczkowski construct a continuous-time equilibrium model to demonstrate how financial markets affect the ‘real’ economy, particularly through random shocks. Their investigation includes simulating the parts of this economy to show where regulations are needed to control systemic risk. Grasselli and Ismail also model the economy in an agent-based manner. They focus on interbank lending and with numerical solutions analyze the formation of banking systems and their needs and design for investors. This chapter adapts the tools of network models and cellular automata and shows their importance for the systemic risk problem. The two chapters by Garnier, Papanicolaou and Yang and by Fouque and Sun, bring large deviation analysis to bear on stochastic models where firms are connected to other firms in a mean-field manner. The models are different, but similar in spirit and aim to capture the small probability with which the interconnectedness can bring down the whole.

Building on [Corsi et al., 2016], we model a set of financial institutions having Value at Risk capital requirements and investing in a portfolio of risky assets, whose prices evolves stochastically in time and are endogenously driven by the trading decisions of financial institutions. Assuming that they use adaptive expectations of risk, we show that the evolution of the system is described by a slow-fast random dynamical system, which can be studied analytically in some regimes. The model shows how the risk expectations play a central role in determining the systemic stability of the financial system and how wrong risk expectations may create panic-induced reduction or over-optimistic expansion of balance sheets. Specifically, when investors are myopic in estimating the risk, the fixed point equilibrium of the system breaks into leverage cycles and financial variables display a bifurcation cascade eventually leading to chaos. We discuss the role of financial policy and the effects of some market frictions, as the cost of diversification and financial transaction taxes, in determining the stability of the system in the presence of adaptive expectations of risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mazzarisi, Piero; Lillo, Fabrizio; Marmi, Stefano","Mazzarisi, Piero (Scuola Normale Superiore); Lillo, Fabrizio (Università di Bologna); Marmi, Stefano (Scuola Normale Superiore)",,"Mazzarisi, Piero (Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa); Lillo, Fabrizio (University of Bologna); Marmi, Stefano (Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa)",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; University of Bologna,grid.6093.c; grid.6292.f,Pisa; Bologna,Toscana; Emilia-Romagna,Italy; Italy,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00785,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104209593,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

A Micro-Analysis of Banking System Stability,"This paper analyzes the relationship between banks' divergent strategies toward specialization and diversification of financial activities and their ability to withstand a banking sector crash. We first generate market-based measures of banks' systemic risk exposures using extreme value analysis. Systemic banking risk is measured as the tail beta, which equals the probability of a sharp decline in a bank's stock price conditional on a crash in a banking index. Subsequently, the impact of (the correlation between) interest income and the components of non-interest income on this risk measure is assessed. The heterogeneity in extreme bank risk is attributed to differences in the scope of non-traditional banking activities: non-interest generating activities increase banks' tail beta. In addition, smaller banks and better-capitalized banks are better able to withstand extremely adverse conditions. These relationships are stronger during turbulent times compared to normal economic conditions. Overall, diversifying financial activities under one umbrella institution does not improve banking system stability, which may explain why financial conglomerates trade at a discount.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2009,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"De Jonghe, Olivier","De Jonghe, Olivier (Tilburg University - Department of Finance; National Bank of Belgium - Research Department; Tilburg University - European Banking Center)",,"De Jonghe, Olivier ()",,,,,,,,,,,47,0,,13.73,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/144379/1/wp167en.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102265935,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Clinical Research,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth,dims

In this chapter we survey the concepts used in these models and discuss their main findings as well as their applications in systemic risk analysis. Network models are designed to address potential domino effects resulting from the failure of financial institutions. Specifically they attempt to answer the question of whether the failure of one institution will result in the subsequent failure of others. Since in a banking crisis authorities usually intervene to stabilize the banking system, failures and contagious failures by domino effects are very rarely observed in practice. Empirical analysis is thus difficult and as a consequence most studies of insolvency contagion are built on simulation models. In this chapter we describe in some detail how such simulations are designed and discuss the main insights that have so far been obtained by applications to the complex network of real world exposure data of banking systems.

338,pub.1142650425,10.2139/ssrn.3723341,,,,Assessing Shadow Banking – Non-Bank Financial Intermediation in Europe,"Owing to the disruptive events in the shadow banking system during the global financial crisis, policymakers and regulators have sought to strengthen the monitoring framework and to identify any remaining regulatory gaps. In accordance with its mandate, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has engaged in developing a monitoring framework to assess systemic risks in the European Union (EU) shadow banking sector. This assessment framework provides the basis for the EU Shadow Banking Monitor, which will be published each year by the ESRB. The framework also feeds into the ESRB’s Risk Dashboard, internal risk assessment processes and the formulation and implementation of related macro-prudential policies. The ESRB’s Joint Advisory Technical Committee (ATC)-Advisory Scientific Committee (ASC) Expert Group on Shadow Banking (JEGS) has accordingly engaged in: conducting a stocktake of relevant available data and related data gaps; defining criteria for risk mapping in line with the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in this area; deriving indicators using this methodology for the purposes of the ESRB’s risk monitoring and assessment. Shadow banking can be broadly defined as credit intermediation performed outside the traditional banking system. This is consistent with the definition used at the global level by the FSB. Against this background, this paper describes the structure of the shadow banking system in Europe and discusses a range of methodological issues which must be considered when designing a monitoring framework. The paper applies both an “entity-based” approach and an “activity-based” approach when mapping the broad shadow banking system in the EU. In turn, the analysis focuses primarily on examining liquidity and maturity transformation, leverage, interconnectedness with the regular banking system and credit intermediation when assessing the structural vulnerabilities within the shadow banking system in Europe. This approach appears the most appropriate for the purpose of assessing shadow banking related risks within the EU financial system. On this basis, the paper complements the EU Shadow Banking Monitor by providing further methodological detail on the development of risk metrics. The paper presents the analysis underpinning the construction of risk metrics for the shadow banking system in Europe and highlights a number of areas where more granular data are required in order to monitor risks related to certain market activities and interconnectedness within the broader financial system.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Grillet-Aubert, Laurent; Haquin, Jean-Baptiste; Jackson, Clive; Killeen, Neill; Weistroffer, Christian","Grillet-Aubert, Laurent (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Haquin, Jean-Baptiste (European Securities and Markets Authority); Jackson, Clive (European Central Bank (ECB)); Killeen, Neill (European Systemic Risk Board); Weistroffer, Christian (European Central Bank (ECB))",,"Grillet-Aubert, Laurent (); Haquin, Jean-Baptiste (); Jackson, Clive (); Killeen, Neill (); Weistroffer, Christian ()",,,,,,,,,,,7,2,,2.86,,https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/occasional/20160727_occasional_paper_10.en.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142650425,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

During the 2014-2017 years, the banking sector was cleaned up from participants who were not able to comply with the regulatory requirements of the regulator, due to which the study of this topic is of such interest.
The article summarizes the main tasks of recent economic reforms in Ukraine. The impact of these reforms and their implementation tools in the country on the activities of individual banks is studied. The analysis is conducted on the example of assessing the financial condition of JSC ""Ukreximbank"" as systemically important and bankruptcy or inappropriate functioning of which may create systemic risks for the financial system of the country. The possibility of a separate bank to fulfill the tasks set during the reforming is determined. The results show that significant changes in the financial position of the banking institution occurred during the transition from the requirements of one reform program to another.

We also employ the generalized autoregressive score model (GAS) to capture the dynamic asymmetric dependence between the insurers’ returns and the stock market returns. Furthermore, the paper implements a ranking framework that expresses to what extent individual insurers are systemically important in the South African economy. We use the daily stock return of five South African insurers listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange from November 2007 to June 2020. We find that Sanlam and Discovery contribute the most to systemic risk, and Santam turns out to be the least systemically risky insurance company in the South African insurance sector. Our findings defy common belief whereby only banks are systemically risky financial institutions in South Africa and should undergo stricter regulatory measures.

Evidence from investors’ sustainable orientation,"In this paper, we discuss the attractiveness of green and sustainable assets, from an investor perspective. Inspired by the current state of the art, with researchers positively (re)considering the added value of stocks associated with the fulfilment of sustainable development goals, we analyze whether such stocks demonstrated: (1) a different and (2) an outperforming dynamic during various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we examine sustainable-indexed assets and companies with a fully bio-based production system, against a counterfactual group of non-indexed activities operating in the same sectors. Asset connectivity is investigated by means of a correlation network, and portfolio optimization is applied to measure profitability. The results show: (1) fewer connections between bio-based assets and the “rest of the world,” suggesting that, given their potential long-term resilience, investors might consider them capable of mitigating COVID-19 systemic risk, and therefore a valid investment to hold; and (2) the effectiveness and profitability of bio-based assets in portfolios. Considering the latter finding, we document a switching effect after the hard lockdown phase, during which rational investors (seeking an optimal mean–variance) may have inferred the efficacy of capital re-allocation from simply sustainable assets to bio-based companies. Here, we discuss the potential role of the pandemic as an accelerator of the sustainable green transition, considering the welfare implications in terms of socio-economic wellbeing and reduction of negative environmental externalities deriving from the conversion of the traditional production and management system.

The measure allows for splitting the contribution of individual banks into systemic risk as the sum of two components—the stand-alone bank risk and the contagion risk—and measuring the role of assets, riskiness, capitalization, and interconnectedness as determinants of each of the two components. Results show that the variables determining the stand-alone risk component are different from those determining the contagion risk component, so that a bank which is relatively safe with respect to stand-alone risk, can be an important contagion vehicle, or vice versa. Results also show that crisis severity significantly affects results, so that the severity of different crises results in different weights for the input variables and different contributions for the banks considered.

Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing? Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime.",,,Asian Journal of Law and Society,,Cambridge University Press (CUP),"2052-9015, 2052-9023",,2017-06-13,2017,2017-06-13,,,,1-1,All OA; Bronze,Article,"TSAI, Chang-hsien; PENG, Kuan-Jung","TSAI, Chang-hsien (); PENG, Kuan-Jung ()",,"TSAI, Chang-hsien (); PENG, Kuan-Jung ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,1.27,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4A4C48A3EA43D6AFB11BDF87B441221A/S2052901517000080a.pdf/div-class-title-the-fintech-revolution-and-financial-regulation-the-case-of-online-supply-chain-financing-erratum-div.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1086000278,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4804 Law In Context; 4807 Public Law,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",dims

Global Ceacam1 gene deletion impaired insulin clearance to cause chronic hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance [1]. It also caused spontaneous endothelial dysfunction and hypertension [2] in addition to atherogenic-like plaques in addition to lipid and macrophage deposition, as well as elevated leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the aortic wall in the absence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia when the mutation was propagated on the C57BL/6 genetic background [3]. Because CEACAM1 promotes endothelial survival, vascular integrity, and pro-angiogenesis, we investigated the cell-autonomous role of endothelial cell CEACAM1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To this aim, we generated endothelial cell CEACAM1 knockout mice and backcrossed them with low density lipoprotein receptor deficient mice (ldlr–/– VECad+Cc1fl/fl) prior to feeding them a high cholesterol diet for 3 months and characterizing both of their metabolic and vascular phenotypes. By comparison to ldlr–/– mice, the mutants exhibited insulin sensitivity and moderate hypercholesterolemia. However, they exhibited decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability with a reciprocal increase in plasma endothelin-1 and increased oxidative stress. The mutants also developed fibrotic plaques with elevated macrophage recruitment on the aortic wall without lipid deposition. We postulate that endothelin-1 contributes to fibrosis in these mice. Elevated endothelin-1 levels could stem from increased ras-MAPKinase signaling pathways in response to lower sequestration of Shc and increased coupling of Grb2 to insulin and VEGR in the absence of Ceacam1. Moreover, in the absence of Ceacam1, binding of Shp2 phosphatase to IRS1 increases to reduce IRS-1/Akt/eNOS activity and subsequently, lower NO production. Thus, the ldlr–/– VECad+Cc1fl/fl mouse can provide an in vivo system to delineate the endothelial cell-specific CEACAM1 effect on fibrosis independent of systemic risk factors. References: 1.

Traditional approaches to financial pricing models cannot incorporate the nature of climate risk (i.e. deep uncertainty, non-linearity and endogeneity), and of financial risks (interconnectedness and complexity). To fill this gap, we developed a transparent, science-based framework to assess and price climate financial risks under uncertainty, the CLIMAFIN tool. It embeds climate scenarios adjusted financial pricing models (for equity holdings, sovereign and corporate bonds), climate scenarios conditioned risk metrics (such as the Climate Spread and the Climate Value-at-Risk). These allow us to introduce forward-looking climate risk scenarios in the valuation of counterparty risk, in the probability of default and largest losses on investors’ portfolios.

Evidence from the Tunisian Banking Sector,"Weak and ineffective bank governance mechanisms are identified as the main triggers of a financial crisis. One of the main issues raised by researchers is the role of executive compensation in encouraging risk-taking. We conduct this research to determine whether executive compensation is an incentive for risk-taking and contributes to the overall systemic risk for a sample including seven banks from the biggest private Tunisian listed banks over the period 2009-2019. Based on the agency theory and the moral hazard hypothesis, compensation is assumed to be an incentive for interest and risk preferences alignment. Indeed, our results show that managers are willing to take excessive risk s that may increase systemic risk levels. Managers tend to be risk seeking to increase bank performance and are motivated to keep their position, and their job opportunities. Surprisingly, the robustness test highlights that only fixed component is related to systemic risk measures suggesting that, provided with fixed wages, managers feel safe and are not reluctant to invest in all projects reporting positive net present value irrespective of their risk which may result in excessive risk taking.",,,Theoretical Economics Letters,,Scientific Research Publishing,"2162-2078, 2162-2086",,2021-07-23,2021,2021-07-23,2021,11,04,803-823,All OA; Gold,Article,"Imen, Fredj; Marjène, Rabah Gana","Imen, Fredj (Carthage University, Institut des Hautes études Commerciales de Carthage, Laboratoire d’économie et de Finance Appliqués, Tunis, Tunisia); Marjène, Rabah Gana (Carthage University, Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie, Laboratoire d’économie et de Finance Appliqués, Tunis, Tunisia)",,"Imen, Fredj (University of Carthage); Marjène, Rabah Gana (University of Carthage)",University of Carthage,grid.419508.1,Tunis,,Tunisia,,,,,,1,1,,1.0,1.0,http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=111624,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140759932,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

In particular, when the level of financial depth is low, traditional leading indicators of banking crises have poor predictive performance and the analysis should be based on indicators that account for financial deepening while taking into consideration countries’ structural limits.

It is natural to address complex financial issues such as the European sovereign debt crisis from the perspective of network. In this article, we construct a network model according to the debt–credit relations instead of using the conventional methodology to measure the default risk. Based on the model, a risk index is examined using the quarterly report of consolidated foreign claims from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and debt/GDP ratios among these reporting countries. The empirical results show that this index can help the regulators and practitioners not only to determine the status of interconnectivity but also to point out the degree of the sovereign debt default risk. Our approach sheds new light on the investigation of quantifying the systemic risk.","This research is supported by the National Science Council (NSC-100-2118-M-001-007-MY2) in Taiwan.

Considering these natures, we develop a novel W-QR-CoVaR method to measure systemic risk. To be specific, the W-QR-CoVaR method combines the wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA) with the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) method based on the quantile regression (QR) framework. We then apply it to measure the systemic risk in the Chinese banking industry covering the period from September 2007 to September 2018. Our experiment results show that the hybrid W-QR-CoVaR method performs better than the traditional CoVaR method in terms of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we also explore the relation between the systemic risk contribution of each individual bank and the bank-specific characteristics. Size and leverage appear to be the most robustness determinants. The findings suggest that regulators should pay more attention to the banks with smaller size and higher leverage.","The authors are grateful to the Editor-in-Chief and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and constructive guidance.

Bank holdings of sovereign debt issued by peripheral eurozone countries have dropped in value and are being reclassified from their prior riskless weight assigned by Basel III. Banks are also experiencing serious difficulties in raising new funds from their markets. Default risks and systemic-risk capital shortfalls are delineated for individual banks. Ten European banks are currently among the top 14 global banking institutions ranked by probability of default. Italy’s UniCredit displays the largest five-year default probability (39%), based on spreads of credit default swaps. Eight European banks are included among the top 11 global banks ranked by expected capital shortfalls associated with systemic risk in the next major credit and illiquidity crisis, with Deutsche Bank requiring the largest additional capital ($232 billion).

invest in any enterprise linked to her, and at the same time, raise capital for
her firm's enterprise from other agents she is linked to. Failing to raise
sufficient capital results with the firm defaulting, being unable to invest in
others. Our main objective is to examine the role of collateral contracts in
handling the strategic risk that can propagate to a systemic risk throughout
the network in a cascade of defaults. We take a mechanism-design approach and
solve for the optimal scheme of collateral contracts that capital raisers offer
their investors. These contracts aim at sustaining the efficient level of
investment as a unique Nash equilibrium, while minimizing the total collateral.
  Our main results contrast the network environment with its non-network
counterpart (where the sets of investors and capital raisers are disjoint). We
show that for acyclic investment networks, the network environment does not
necessitate any additional collaterals, and systemic risk can be fully handled
by optimal bilateral collateral contracts between capital raisers and their
investors. This is, unfortunately, not the case for cyclic investment networks.
We show that bilateral contracting will not suffice to resolve systemic risk,
and the market will need an external entity to design a global collateral
scheme for all capital raisers. Furthermore, the minimum total collateral that
will sustain the efficient level of investment as a unique equilibrium may be
arbitrarily higher, even in simple cyclic investment networks, compared with
its corresponding non-network environment. Additionally, we prove
computational-complexity results, both for a single enterprise and for

English Abstract: Recent global financial crisis has taught us a lot of important lessons in various aspects. It is, among them, one of hot issues that monetary stability focusing on price stability seems not sufficient for sound macroeconomic management in spite of remarkable achievement on that side during the last couple of decade. Financial stability should be taken into account as well. The issues are how and with what kind of policy instruments these two targets could be achieved. Certainly the sole short-term interest rate is not sufficient to achieve these two targets. Since the recent global financial crisis, macroprudential regulations have been popularly proposed as appropriate policy instruments to fill the ‘missing pillar’. This paper discusses some basic concepts of macroprudential regulations and their instruments for their actual implementation based on the transmission mechanism of systemic risks or crisis. And then empirical analysis based on the Open Economy New Keynesian Asset Price model is carried out to amine the effectiveness of macroprudential regulations on the monetary as well as financial stabilities. The results of the studies show that the combination of monetary policy taking into account asset prices as well as inflation, and the macropudential regulations, in particular, the enhancement of capital adequacy, can improve financial stability as well as price and output stabilities.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2011,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Oh, John Junggun","Oh, John Junggun (Korea University)",,"Oh, John Junggun (Korea University)",Korea University,grid.222754.4,Seoul,,South Korea,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091633169,,,,,,,,,dims

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of thrombophilia among RVO patients with and without systemic risk factors and among patients younger and older than 50 years.
DESIGN: Prospective case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty one patients with RVO, including 92 with acquired risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus) and 29 without these factors. The control group included 60 persons matched for age, sex, and risk factors.
METHODS: All participants were screened for Leiden mutation (FV Leiden), hyperprothrombinemia (20210 G/A mutation) and deficiency of protein C, S, and antithrombin.
RESULTS: The prevalence of FV Leiden was significantly higher among RVO patients without risk factors (24.1%) than among controls without risk factors (0%; p = 0.034) and among RVO patients with acquired disorders (4.3%; p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in the prevalence of the other investigated thrombophilic factors. In all, 37.9% patients without acquired risk factors were positive for at least 1 thrombophilic factor compared with 7.6% RVO patients with acquired risk factors (p < 0.001) and 8.3% of the controls (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of thrombophilic disorders among RVO patients according to age.
CONCLUSIONS: FV Leiden is significantly more frequent among RVO patients without acquired risk factors. Thrombophilia plays a much more important role in the pathogenesis of RVO in patients without acquired risk factors.

Rarely, it can occur in the cerebral or splanchnic veins and these are the most frightening manifestations because of their high mortality rate. A third site of rare venous thrombosis is the deep system of the upper extremities that, as for the lower extremity, can be complicated by pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The authors conducted a narrative review focused on clinical manifestations, risk factors, and treatment of rare venous thromboses. Local risk factors such as infections or cancer are frequent in thrombosis of cerebral or portal veins. Upper extremity deep-vein thrombosis is mostly due to local risk factors (catheter- or effort-related). Common systemic risk factors for rare venous thromboses are inherited thrombophilia and oral contraceptive use; chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are closely associated with splanchnic vein thrombosis. In the acute phase rare venous thromboses should be treated conventionally with low-molecular-weight heparin. Use of local or systemic fibrinolysis should be considered in the case of clinical deterioration in spite of adequate anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with vitamin K-antagonists is recommended for 3-6 months after a first episode of rare venous thrombosis. Indefinite anticoagulation is recommended for Budd-Chiari syndrome, recurrent thrombosis or unprovoked thrombosis and permanent risk factors. In conclusion, the progresses made in the last couple of decades in diagnostic imaging and the broadened knowledge of thrombophilic abnormalities improved the recognition of rare venous thromboses and the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms.

Conservative regulation of the banking sector helped this segment avoid a financial meltdown, and low loan-to-value ratios in mortgage lending are undoubtedly helping limit the pace of house-price increases. Nevertheless, as elsewhere, capital requirements and stress tests for banks have been ramped up. Also the identification and monitoring of systemic risks and macro-prudential problems has intensified. In the Israeli context somewhat unusual issues arise from the control of most of Israel.s major financial institutions by family-based business groups that have significant interests in non-financial sectors of the economy. This close link between the financial and non-financial sectors generates potential risks to financial stability, and it is a key issue in a wider debate about the relative merits of the business groups in terms of competition and control in the economy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeat scans of 61 participants, acquired as part of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Carotid MRI substudy, were digitally segmented using automated 3D level set methods, relying on an operator only to select the branch endpoints and thresholds for the 3D lumen surface initialization. Geometric factors characterizing the 3D lumen geometry were then extracted automatically.
RESULTS: Of 122 scans, 117 could be segmented within 5 minutes each, with 40% being of sufficiently high quality to require less than 2 minutes each. Irrespective of scan quality, geometric factors were found to be highly reproducible, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) typically above 0.9. The reconstructed lumen surfaces were reproducible to <0.3 mm on average, comparable to previous MRI-based reproducibility studies. Owing to the automated nature of the analysis, operator reliability was near-perfect (ICC >0.99), with lumen surface differences <0.1 mm.
CONCLUSION: The 3D geometry of the carotid bifurcation can be characterized rapidly and with a high degree of consistency, even for suboptimal image qualities. This bodes well for large-scale retrospective or prospective studies aimed at teasing out the influence of local vs. systemic risk factors for early atherosclerosis.","The authors thank the staff and participants of the ARIC study for their important contributions, and Dr. Yiemeng Hoi for assisting with the interoperator substudy.",,Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging,,Wiley,"1053-1807, 1522-2586","Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Contrast Media; Feasibility Studies; Gadolinium DTPA; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",2011-01-27,2011,2011-01-27,2011-02,33,2,482-489,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Bijari, Payam B.; Antiga, Luca; Wasserman, Bruce A.; Steinman, David A.","Bijari, Payam B.

240,pub.1142653911,10.2139/ssrn.1629757,,,,Financial Stability Challenges in EU Candidate Countries - Financial Systems in the Aftermath of the Global Crisis,"This paper reviews financial stability challenges in the EU candidate countries: Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey. It follows a macro-prudential approach, emphasising systemic risks and the stability of financial systems as a whole. The paper recalls that the economies of all three countries experienced a recession in 2008-09 and shows how this slowed the rapid process of financial deepening that had been taking place since the beginning of the last decade. The deteriorating economic and financial conditions manifested themselves, first and foremost, through a marked deterioration in asset quality. These direct credit risks were compounded by the transformation of exchange and interest rate risks through a widespread use of foreign exchange-denominated or indexed loans and variable or adjustable interest rate loans. Moreover, funding and liquidity risks also materialised to some extent, although fully fledged bank runs were avoided, and none of the countries experienced a sharp reversal in external financing. Overall, the deterioration in asset quality has so far been managed well by the banking systems of the candidate countries, facilitated by large capital buffers, pro-active macro-prudential policies pursued by the authorities both before and during the crisis and the relative stability of exchange rates. Looking ahead, although uncertainties remain high regarding credit quality, the shock-absorbing capacities of the banking systems are fairly robust, as also evidenced by their relative resilience so far. Nevertheless, as the economic recovery sets in, the central banks should return to and possibly reinforce the implementation of measures to avoid a pro-cyclical build-up of credit (asset) boom-bust cycles. Furthermore, given the relevance of foreign-owned banks in two of the three countries, a continued strengthening of home-host cooperation in the supervisory area will be crucial to avoid any kind of regulatory arbitrage.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Bracke, Thierry; Polgar, Eva Katalin; Buysse, Kristel; Rusinova, Desislava; Francart, Alexandre; Knobloch, Corinna; Stavrianou, Nikolaos; Diev, Pavel; Cocozza, Emidio; Frost, Jon; Gardo, Sandor; Farelius, David","Bracke, Thierry (European Central Bank (ECB)); Polgar, Eva Katalin (European Central Bank (ECB)); Buysse, Kristel (European Central Bank (ECB)); Rusinova, Desislava (European Central Bank (ECB) - Directorate General International and European Relations); Francart, Alexandre (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Knobloch, Corinna (Deutsche Bundesbank - Economic Research Centre); Stavrianou, Nikolaos (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Diev, Pavel (Banque de France); Cocozza, Emidio (Bank of Italy); Frost, Jon (Bank for International Settlements; University of Cambridge - Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance); Gardo, Sandor (Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB)); Farelius, David (Sveriges Riksbank - Research Division)",,"Bracke, Thierry (); Polgar, Eva Katalin (); Buysse, Kristel (); Rusinova, Desislava (); Francart, Alexandre (); Knobloch, Corinna (); Stavrianou, Nikolaos (); Diev, Pavel (Banque de France); Cocozza, Emidio (Bank of Italy); Frost, Jon (); Gardo, Sandor (); Farelius, David ()",Banque de France; Bank of Italy,grid.466529.a; grid.466503.2,Paris; Rome,; ,France; Italy,,,,,,1,0,,0.29,,http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp115.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142653911,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

As prime contractor, Lockheed Martin designed and built the microgrid system, intelligently integrating distributed diesel generation, solar photovoltaic (PV) array, and grid-scale energy storage with the medium voltage utility grid and facility loads at one of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Complexes at Fort Bliss. Currently the United States (U.S.) power grid is largely centralized with a handful of large utilities handling the majority of power production in the country. In 1996, a sagging power line in Oregon brushed up against a tree, and then within minutes, 12 million electricity customers in eight states lost power. Such is the vulnerability of the aging U.S. power grid. In order to remedy this systemic risk from large scale blackouts a new more decentralized system can be used in which a cluster of on-site power generation devices/assets can service local loads in the event of power loss from the Utility. A microgrid is a localized set of generation, energy storage, and loads that normally operate connected to a traditional utility grid. There is a single point of common coupling with the utility grid that can be disconnected if the microgrid needs to be able to operate without utility power in the event of utility failure. The primary benefit of a microgrid is energy surety/resiliency/mission sustainment; however there can be advantages in found in energy cost savings depending on one s electric rate structure. The Energy Manager needs to fully understand their electric provider s rate structure and the load profile of their facilities in order to effectively design a microgrid to help in energy costs.",,,,,,,,2014-04,2014,,,,,,Closed,Article,"Hall, Teri L; Fsicher, Curtis H","Hall, Teri L (); Fsicher, Curtis H ()",,"Hall, Teri L (); Fsicher, Curtis H ()",,,,,,,,,,,3,0,,0.82,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091750074,"40 Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",,,,,,B12 Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy,dims

With this model, we construct a series of indices to describe how the extreme risk connectedness evolves over time at the institution, country and global levels, and study the underlying factors driving the connectedness. Our results show that the degree of globalization, in particular, political globalization plays the most important role in driving a country’s importance in global extreme risk propagation. We also identify the “emerging market fear”, which is evidenced by the increased importance of emerging countries in the global financial extreme risk propagation; the increased proportion of emerging market-based institutions in the systemically important financial institution cohort; and a stronger granular impact of emerging market extreme risk on the global financial market stability.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty volunteers (69 male, 111 female) who were categorized as systemically healthy control, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obese and menopause were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic characteristics and oral health behaviors were recorded via questionnaire. Clinical periodontal parameters, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), sulcus bleeding index (SBI) and decayed, missing, and filled teeth index (DMFT), were assessed. Systemic parameters and LXA4 levels were evaluated in serum samples.
RESULTS: Clinical periodontal parameters and DMFT were higher in subjects with achieved systemic risk factors than in healthy subjects. The systemically healthy with periodontitis group had higher serum LXA4 levels than the systemically healthy with non-periodontitis group (P<0.05). The Ne/Ly ratio was higher in the hyperlipidemic group with periodontitis than in the hyperlipidemic group with non-periodontitis (P<0.05). In the control group, serum LXA4 levels were positively correlated with the PD, CAL and SBI.
CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of periodontitis, an increase in LXA4 levels and the Ne/Ly ratio in hyperlipidemic patients could contribute to the hypothesis that these parameters could be an indicator in periodontitis and its systemic risk factors.",The authors thank Mr. Hakan DOĞANGÖNÜL for performing the laboratory analyses.,,Medical Science Monitor,,International Scientific Information,"1234-1010, 1643-3750",Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Lipoxins; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Neutrophils; Periodontitis; Risk Factors; Young Adult,2015,2015,2015,,21,,2485-2493,All OA; Green,Article,"Doğan, Burak; Fentoğlu, Özlem; Kırzıoğlu, Fatma Yeşim; Kemer, Esra Sinem; Köroğlu, Banu Kale; Aksu, Oğuzhan; Çarsancaklı, Süleyman Akif; Orhan, Hikmet","Doğan, Burak (Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mustafa Kemal University, Hatay, Turkey); Fentoğlu, Özlem (Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey); Kırzıoğlu, Fatma Yeşim (Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey); Kemer, Esra Sinem (Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey); Köroğlu, Banu Kale (Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey); Aksu, Oğuzhan (Division of Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey); Çarsancaklı, Süleyman Akif (Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Süleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey); Orhan, Hikmet (Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Süleyman Demirel University, Faculty of Medicine, Isparta, Turkey)","Doğan, Burak (Mustafa Kemal University)","Doğan, Burak (Mustafa Kemal University); Fentoğlu, Özlem (Süleyman Demirel University); Kırzıoğlu, Fatma Yeşim (Süleyman Demirel University); Kemer, Esra Sinem (Süleyman Demirel University); Köroğlu, Banu Kale (Süleyman Demirel University); Aksu, Oğuzhan (Süleyman Demirel University); Çarsancaklı, Süleyman Akif (Süleyman Demirel University); Orhan, Hikmet (Süleyman Demirel University)",Mustafa Kemal University; Süleyman Demirel University,grid.14352.31; grid.45978.37,Antakya; Isparta,; ,Turkey; Turkey,,,,,,25,13,1.0,8.09,,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4551304?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034146220,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,Aging; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease,,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

They remained almost unchanged in recent decades, whereas the banking landscape underwent a tremendous metamorphosis. Market-oriented banking is characterized by a new type of systemic risk, a risk which essentially evolves off the radar screen, i.e., off-balance sheet (OBS) (Calmès and Théoret Journal of Banking and Finance 34 (7): 1719–1728, 2010, 2011). In this article, we argue that the standard leverage indicators are not fitted to capture this kind of new banking risk. We introduce a new empirical framework which enables us to exploit the cyclical properties of elasticity leverage measures, while at the same time controlling for the noisy information they usually deliver. In a nutshell, thanks to the Kalman filter, we are able to compute optimal levels of bank leverage. This methodology delivers cyclical, forward-looking measures signalling systemic risk bubbles years before their burst. By properly accounting for all activities, including market-oriented banking, these time-varying leverage measures tend to systemically capture regulatory capital arbitrage and the OBS risk it entails.","We would like to thank the participants at the 74th Meeting of the International Atlantic Economic Society and particularly Joseph Macri for discussing our paper in the session on macroeconomic theory.

A framework of criteria for effective legislation is developed. The original prudent person rule provided a good framework for legislation, but most subsequent regulation that has been enacted does not meet our criteria. Recently regulation has increased the cost and risk of individual schemes and the systemic risk in the system as a whole. The article finds that, in totality, regulation has been disastrous for these schemes, contributing to their demise. The article concludes by briefly outlining how effective regulation might have developed to produce a flexible and resilient system.",Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Robert Pullan for his help in preparing this paper. The views expressed in this paper are not necessarily the views of the authors&#x27; employers.,"Solvency regulations: Minimum Funding Requirement 1996 (Replaced by Pensions Act 2004) The Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR) of 1996 was enacted to ensure that pension funds were being funded at ‘safe’ levels. The MFR was introduced in the Pensions Act of 1995 in response to the Maxwell Pensions Scandal as a way to restore confidence for workers in their pensions. However, in addition to the cost of such regulations, the MFR gave pensioners the illusion that their pension schemes were safe. Arguably, this encouraged companies to have contribution holidays. With the removal of ATC relief in 1997, the MFR was also reduced to help companies deal with the removal of tax relief. The MFR fell by 18 per cent in 1998, and then a further 8 per cent in 2002, such that the MFR requirement only covered at most 50 per cent of the guaranteed liabilities. Over time, if companies just matched the MFR, then eventually, pension liabilities would exceed pension assets. Indeed, the funding position of pensions did deteriorate and, so, from 2001 to 2006, employer contributions to occupational pension schemes rose from £16.5 billion to £38.7 billion (ONS, 2011). This increase is considered ‘to have been associated with the requirement to finance deficits in private sector DB pension schemes’ (ONS, 2011). Ultimately, the adverse consequences of the MFR were realised, and this requirement was replaced by the Pensions Act of 2004 that allowed for ‘a ‘scheme specific funding requirement’ to ensure that pension funds are maintained at a more realistic level in future (The Occupational Pensioners Alliance).",Economic Affairs,,Wiley,"0265-0665, 1468-0270",,2012-10-18,2012,2012-10-18,2012-10,32,3,50-57,Closed,Article,"Silver, Nick; Pant, Saurabh","Silver, Nick (); Pant, Saurabh ()",,"Silver, Nick (); Pant, Saurabh ()",,,,,,,,,,,3,0,,1.08,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008799888,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,Prevention,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

256,pub.1102397307,10.2139/ssrn.2377371,,,,The Empty Call for Benefit-Cost Analysis in Financial Regulation,"“Benefit-cost analysis” as applied to financial regulation is a serious category mistake that has the potential to stymie regulation aimed at the reduction of systemic risk in favor of privileging a status quo that we know is unstable. Benefit-cost analysis, which gained prominence from its applications in health, safety, and environmental regulation, contemplates an omniscient social planner who can calculate costs and benefits generated by a system that is essentially stable, because it rests on natural constraints, in particular the laws of chemistry, biology, and physics. By contrast, finance is a constructed system, created by financial regulation itself and subsequent adaptations. Any non-trivial new rule would change the system of finance in ways that are hard to foresee and thus would undercut the value of a prior calculation of benefits and costs. Instead, optimal financial regulation policy should be understood as based on a series of trade-offs of values that are normatively derived, for example: the desire to achieve the economic benefits from the free flow of capital and the ready availability of credit as balanced against the risks of systemic distress and the associated economic disruption. These value trade-offs will produce subsidiary principles of pragmatic design, for example: minimize the extent to which financial institution can free-ride on systemic stability costs paid by others; provide regulators with sufficient information to observe the build-up of imbalance in the financial system and the power to make regulatory modifications accordingly. Rather than insist on a meaningless, if not misleading, benefit cost analysis that seems not required by any substantive regulatory statute, a reviewing court should apply rationality review to a regulatory agency’s application of pragmatic judgment.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gordon, Jeffrey N.","Gordon, Jeffrey N.

To study the systemic risk of financial systems, we create a bi-partite banking network model composed of banks and bank assets and propose a cascading failure model to describe the risk propagation process during crises. We empirically test the model with 2007 US commercial banks balance sheet data and compare the model prediction of the failed banks with the real failed banks after 2007. We find that our model efficiently identifies a significant portion of the actual failed banks reported by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The results suggest that this model could be useful for systemic risk stress testing for financial systems. The model also identifies that commercial rather than residential real estate assets are major culprits for the failure of over 350 US commercial banks during 2008–2011.",,,Scientific Reports,,Springer Nature,2045-2322,,2013-04-08,2013,2013-04-08,,3,1,1591,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huang, Xuqing; Vodenska, Irena; Havlin, Shlomo; Stanley, H.

257,pub.1121368658,10.2139/ssrn.1475189,,,,Basel II and the Capital Requirements Directive: Responding to the 2008/09 Financial Crisis,"This paper addresses factors which have prompted the need for further revision of banking regulation, with particular reference to the Capital Requirements Directive. The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which comprises the 2006/48/EC Directive on the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and the 2006/49/EC Directive on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions, implemented the revised framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II) within EU member states. Pro cyclicality has attracted a lot of attention – particularly with regards to the recent financial crisis, owing to concerns arising from increased sensitivity to credit risk under Basel II. This paper not only considers whether such concerns are well-founded, but also the beneficial and not so beneficial consequences emanating from Basel II’s increased sensitivity to credit risk (as illustrated by the Internal Ratings Based approaches). In so doing it considers the effects of Pillar 2 of Basel II, namely, supervisory review, with particular reference to buffer levels, and whether banks’ actual capital ratios can be expected to correspond with Basel capital requirements given the fact that they are expected to hold certain capital buffers under Pillar 2. Furthermore, it considers how regulators can respond to prevent systemic risks to the financial system during periods when firms which are highly leveraged become reluctant to lend. In deciding to cut back on lending activities, are the decisions of such firms justified in situations where such firms’ credit risk models are extremely and unduly sensitive - hence the level of capital being retained is actually much higher than minimum regulatory Basel capital requirements?",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,1556-5068,,2009-09,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Delaney, Marianne Ojo D","Delaney, Marianne Ojo D (American Accounting Association)",,"Delaney, Marianne Ojo D (American Accounting Association)",American Accounting Association,grid.431156.4,Sarasota,Florida,United States,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17379/1/MPRA_paper_17379.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121368658,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Systemic risks have emerged from the decisions of individual firms, e.g., outsourcing and buffer reduction, and are now beyond their control. This paper aims to identify appropriate approaches to mitigating those risks.   Design/methodology/approach Systemic risks require analyzing supply chains beyond a dyadic perspective. This study approaches the problem through the lenses of complex systems and network theories. Drawing on the lessons learned from other systemic-risk-prone systems, e.g. energy and financial networks, both in research and practice, this study analyzes the adequate level of governance to monitor and manage systemic risks in supply chains.   Findings The authors argue that governance institutions should be mandated to overview and reduce systemic risks in supply chains from the top down, as central bankers do for the financial system. Using firm-level data and tools from network analysis and system dynamics, they could quantify systemic risks, identify risk-prone interconnections in supply chains and design mitigating measures. This top-down approach would complement the bottom-up supply chain management approach and could help insurers design policies for contingent business interruptions.   Originality/value Instead of looking at supply chains purely from the firms’ angle, the perspective of insurers and governments is brought in to reflect on the governance of risks.",This work was financially supported by the Peter de Jánosi Postdoctoral Fellowship.,,Supply Chain Management An International Journal,,Emerald,"1359-8546, 1758-6852",,2022-10-05,2022,2022-10-05,2023-04-28,28,4,682-694,All OA; Green,Article,"Colon, Celian; Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan","Colon, Celian (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria); Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Laxenburg, Austria)","Colon, Celian (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis)","Colon, Celian (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis); Hochrainer-Stigler, Stefan (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis)",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis,grid.75276.31,Laxenburg,,Austria,,,,,,2,2,,,,https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/18260/1/CC_SHS_SCMIJ_AAM.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151584853,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

285,pub.1102404851,10.2139/ssrn.2418194,,,,Governing Macro Prudential Policy: Do Central Bankers Do it Better?,"This paper offers a positive analysis of the relationships between macro prudential policy, micro supervision and central banking, presenting two contributions. Starting from the review of the recent theoretical models, which take the issue of the central bank involvement in macro supervision, it has been discovered that one relevant topic is missed: the political economy of the macro supervisory architecture. Here a principal agent model is used to design a political economy framework, which explains how the politicians can shape the central bank governance in addressing financial systemic risks, taking into account both the social and political pros and cons in having a central bank more or less involved in macro supervision. The framework is used to empirically analyse the present settings in 31 countries. We find that central banks in charge of banking micro supervision are likely to get macro prudential powers; on top the same is true the more the central banker is politically dependent. From the point of view of the politicians on the one side the more the central bank already acting as banking micro supervisor, the smaller will be the risk that its involvement in macro supervision will produce negative spillover effects; on the other side the political dependence may represent the commitment devise to mitigate the fear of the politicians to face an over powerful central bank.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Masciandaro, Donato; Volpicella, Alessio","Masciandaro, Donato (Bocconi University - Department of Economics); Volpicella, Alessio (Queen Mary University of London, School of Economics and Finance)",,"Masciandaro, Donato (Bocconi University); Volpicella, Alessio (Queen Mary University of London)",Bocconi University; Queen Mary University of London,grid.7945.f; grid.4868.2,Milan; London,; ,Italy; United Kingdom,,,,,,1,0,,0.41,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102404851,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

The proposed models are particularly attractive for relatively high dimensional applications, involving fifty or more variables, and can be combined with semiparametric marginal distributions to obtain flexible multivariate distributions. Factor copulas generally lack a closed-form density, but we obtain analytical results for the implied tail dependence using extreme value theory, and we verify that simulation-based estimation using rank statistics is reliable even in high dimensions. We consider ""scree"" plots to aid the choice of the number of factors in the model. The model is applied to daily returns on all 100 constituents of the S&P 100 index, and we find significant evidence of tail dependence, heterogeneous dependence, and asymmetric dependence, with dependence being stronger in crashes than in booms. We also show that factor copula models provide superior estimates of some measures of systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Oh, Dong Hwan; Patton, Andrew J.","Oh, Dong Hwan (Federal Reserve Board); Patton, Andrew J.

The potential advantages of immediate implants are that treatment time can be shortened, with fewer surgical procedures and that bone volumes might be partially maintained, thus possibly providing good aesthetic results. Undertaking a comprehensive examination with careful assessment to assess the risk factors may influence placement approach, with a more conservative delayed placement approach indicated for a higher risk patient with local or systemic risk factors. Understanding the morphology of a socket after tooth extraction may allow optimal placement as well as stability of an implant.

Using a large hospital-based database, the aim of this study was to confirm reported risk factors for glossodynia. Methods: A commercial database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH) of electronic health record data from 26 major US healthcare systems was surveyed. All patients with a Systematized Nomenclature Of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)—under which ICD codes are mapped—of glossodynia between 1999 and 2021 were included. The prevalence, age-, race-, and sex-based distributions and systemic risk factors, selected based on current research diagnostic criteria for burning mouth syndrome, were determined through univariate analysis. Results: Of 78,434,340 individuals in the database, we identified 35,150 individuals with glossodynia (0.04%). Individuals with glossodynia were more likely to be female (OR: 5.98) and Caucasian (OR: 2.55). The prevalence of glossodynia increased with age and was more likely to be reported by those with a history of smoking (OR: 3.70) or alcohol use (OR: 4.41). The highest risk factor was xerostomia (OR: 73.11) with an OR of 66.87 after excluding Sjögren's syndrome and oral radiation. The remaining risk factors in descending order were: zinc deficiency (OR: 26.30), Sjögren's syndrome (OR: 25.85), fibromyalgia (OR: 15.29), vitamin B deficiency (OR: 11.16), irritable bowel syndrome (OR: 10.76), menopause (OR: 10.98), vitamin D deficiency (OR: 9.86), neuropathy (OR: 9.55), GERD (OR: 9.63), hypo-magnesium (OR: 7.85), iron deficiency anemia (OR: 7.17), systemic lupus erythematous (OR: 6.65), thyroid gland disorders (OR: 6.13), rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 5.78), ACE inhibitor use (OR: 4.20), and type 2 diabetes (OR: 3.55). All ORs were statistically significant with p<0.0001. Multivariate analysis is currently in process. Conclusions: This is the largest database study to date reporting risk factors for glossodynia in the United States. Patients with glossodynia are 73 times more likely to have xerostomia and 26 times more likely to have a zinc deficiency when compared to controls.

This paper investigates the systemic risk of the Korean life insurance industry with the emphasis on procyclicality, market structure and market exit cases in 90s. First procyclicality of life insurance industry was much lower than that of banking industry. Second substitutability problem appears not serious because first the decreasing market concentration rate and second the nature of life insurance products sold in the Korean market. Finally It is because of herding behavior of rackless growth competition of life insurers and the absense of proper solvency regulations plus the failure of early intervention of the insurance regulatory authority that causes exiting of 50 percent of local life insurers in 90s.

METHODS: We describe 15 eyes of 15 young patients without any other systemic risk factors, except controlled arterial hypertension in 5 of them, with the diagnosis of Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), Mixed occlusions (Artery and Vein) and Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with a previous COVID-19 infection demonstrated with a positive COVID-19 IgG Test (COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette, Lambra Laboratories, Madrid, Spain.
RESULTS: 9 males and 6 females, with a mean age of presentation of 49.7 ± 9 years old were included. The mean time between infection and diagnosis of the disease was 3.5 ± 1.2 months. The most common retinal or optic nerve vascular complication was CRVO (6 cases), following by CRAO (4 cases), Mixed arterial and venous occlusions (2 cases), NAION (2 cases) and BRAO (1 case).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a retinal or optic nerve vascular event in a young patient without any other hypercoagulable or genetic thrombophilic disorder, should make us rule out a previous COVID-19 infection.

We study a real-world holdings network and compare it with various alternative scenarios from randomization and rebalancing of the original investments. Scenarios generation relies on algorithms that satisfy the global constraints imposed by the numbers of outstanding shares in the market. We consider fixed-diversification models and diversification-maximizing replicas too. We extensively analyze the interplay between portfolio diversification and differentiation, and how the outreach of exogenous shocks depends on these factors as well as on the type of shock and the size of the network with respect to the market. We find that real portfolios are poorly diversified but highly similar, that portfolio similarity correlates with systemic fragility and that rebalancing can come with an increased similarity depending on the initial network configuration. We show that a large diversification gain is achieved through rebalancing but, noteworthy, that makes the network vulnerable in front of unselective shocks. Also, while the network is riskier in the presence of targeted shocks, it is safer than its random counterparts when it is stressed by widespread price downturns.",Not applicable.,DD acknowledges funding “Fondo di Ateneo per la Ricerca 2019” provided by the University of Sassari.,Applied Network Science,,Springer Nature,2364-8228,,2020-07-14,2020,2020-07-14,2020-12,5,1,37,All OA; Gold,Article,"Delpini, Danilo; Battiston, Stefano; Caldarelli, Guido; Riccaboni, Massimo","Delpini, Danilo (Dept. of Economics and Business, University of Sassari, Via Muroni 25, 07100, Sassari, Italy); Battiston, Stefano (Dept. of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich, Plattenstrasse 32, 8032, Zurich, Switzerland); Caldarelli, Guido (Dept. of Molecular Sciences and Nanosystems, and European Centre for Living Technology, Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, Ca’ Bottacin, Dorsoduro 3911, Calle Crosera, 30123, Venice, Italy; Institute for Complex Systems (CNR) UoS Università “Sapienza”, P.le A.

Secondly, by proposing our own methods of proxying we are able to include a significantly bigger number of systemically important financial institutions in the measurement of systemic risk than any other scientific paper quantifying this risk for the analyzed region. Thirdly, we propose an analysis of the two aspects of systemic risk (fragility or contagion) in the periods of the global financial crisis, European debt crisis and recently, during the economic stagnation period.

To address these problems an operational framework is presented in this paper. This framework introduces the concept of standardized development task and process, risk event, risk factor and risk behavior. Standardized task and process enable propagation of risks from task to process level and they are modeled using system engineering approach (activity model). Risk interactions are modeled on task level and propagated to process level using inter-activity input-output relationships. Risk interaction model includes risk events, risk factor and risk behavior. Risk event defines the value of risk factors. This risk event – risk factor relation is modeled using Bayesian networks and expert opinions. Relationships between risk factors form risk behavior with included interactions. Mentioned relation is represented using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. The main advantage of this approach is that this manner of addressing risk can be at the same time easier from the aspect of necessary data and more precise from the perspective of obtained results.

Using Component Expected Shortfall, we provide estimates of systemic risk in Turkey using daily data from 2005 to 2018 and a comprehensive data set encompassing 54 financial firms. Empirical results show that the preponderance of systemic risk in the sample in Turkey is due to large commercial banks. Top ten systemically important financial institutions dominate systemic risk measures in Turkey and account for more than 90 % of total risk over the sample. Consequently, the risk in the Turkish financial system is concentrated in specific financial institutions and makes close monitoring of the top firms essential. Historical incidence of systemic risk in the sample shows elevated levels of systemic risk correspond to well-known external events. Finally, a bivariate VAR model shows that systemic risk is correlated with measures of global financial risks and has significant negative effects on the real economy particularly on industrial production.

183,pub.1137174467,10.2139/ssrn.3824585,,,,"When the banking gets tough, the large get going: How capital regulation is driving consolidation","In response to the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009), the capital regulation was significantly enhanced through the adoption of regulatory measures aimed to improve the resilience of banks, among others, by increasing the required quantity and quality of capital held. Particular emphasis was placed on addressing the “too-big-to-fail” problem seeking to reduce the incentives for large banks to become ever larger and more systemically relevant. The present paper examines whether the banks’ size affects the level of applicable capital requirements and the amount of (CET1) capital that banks are required to hold. Based on an analysis of the capital requirements for 108 ECB-supervised banks, it is demonstrated that the arrangements governing the calibration of the bank-specific elements of capital requirements (i.e. Pillar 2 Requirement, systemic buffer, Pillar 2 Guidance), as well as other bank-specific characteristics relevant to capital requirements (i.e. banks’ ability to issue AT1 and Tier 2 instruments, RW density) tend to favour G-SIBs and other large banks with assets exceeding €200bn. On average, G-SIBs are subject to a CET1 requirement of c. 3pp lower than banks with assets less than €30bn, mainly due to the fact that they take advantage of the AT1 and Tier 2 allowances granted by CRR/CRDV. Also, given that large banks have a significantly lower RW density, for every billion of assets held, the amount of CET1 capital that G-SIBs are required to hold is nearly half the amount that small banks must keep under the applicable capital requirements.The discrepancies relating to the approach for the determination of the systemic buffer (i.e. highest of G-SII buffer, O-SII buffer, or systemic risk buffer), which is still determined at national level, contribute to the creation of an unlevel playing field in the Banking Union, as banks with similar asset size and systemic relevance are treated in a different manner because they are located in different Member States. Therefore, the SSMR should be amended to transfer the competence for the determination of the systemic buffer to the ECB to ensure that the Banking Union will be treated as a single jurisdiction and the determination of the systemic buffer will be made based on uniform conditions.As demonstrated in this analysis, the capital regulation functions as an incentive, rather than as an obstacle, to the further increase of banks’ size. In light of the need for further consolidation of the banking sector in the Banking Union, banks subject to lower (CET1) capital requirements, as is the case for large banks, need less CET1 capital to finance potential M&As, mostly by leveraging on their ability to tap capital markets for AT1 and Tier 2 issuances. Thus, from a capital requirements perspective, large banks have every incentive to expand their operations, either on domestic or cross-border basis, at the expense of smaller banks.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Maragopoulos, Nikos","Maragopoulos, Nikos (European Banking Institute; Panteion University of Athens)",,"Maragopoulos, Nikos ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,0.99,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137174467,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims
213,pub.1102341832,10.2139/ssrn.1677682,,,,Basel II and Extreme Risk Analysis,"Basel II mandates the maintenance of bank capital to address three broad categories of risk: credit risk, market risk and operation risk. Basel II methodology assumes that credit risk can be reliably specified with respect to particular asset categories. These projections are based on historical experience, reflected in data sets, which are at times general and at times specific to a particular institution. Basel II may have failed, however, to identify the strong shift in the correlation of defaults that accompanied the financial crisis. Market risk assessment displays similar issues of under-anticipated correlation under extreme conditions. Of the three categories, operational risk is the least tractable. It is a catch-all category, reflecting both internal failures and external events. The character of risk shifts markedly between ‘ordinary times’ and extreme events. Consider this matrix: Credit Risk • In Ordinary Times, defaults may be predicted based on historical data; there is no strong correlation of default. • During Extreme Events, there is often inadequate data for a robust quantification of risk, where there is a strong correlation of default. Market Risk • In Ordinary Times, loss of value is linked to the performance of a particular asset. • During Extreme Events, loss of value is linked to asset type (that is, contagion). Operational Risk • In Ordinary Times, operational losses are more likely to be institution-specific. • During Extreme Events, operational losses originate from the general environment. This paper addresses the ability of Basel II to respond to extreme events. Extreme events include events thought to be extremely unlikely and events that are unimagined (and hence ex ante unimaginable). Basel II largely examines risk as faced by individual financial institutions. Yet systemic risk (contagion) is a well-recognized feature of the international financial system. The liquidity crisis, however, appears to be a novel (unanticipated) phenomenon. Cross-failure of institutions may be yet another example of unanticipated correlation of outcomes, with a peculiar magnification effect. Basel II does not ask – at least not explicitly – whether there is adequate capital across the entire banking system. The current financial crisis may be an instance where this failed to hold. A revised Basel regime might need to account for additional capital stored outside individual institutions to assure adequate capital under extreme conditions affecting the broader banking sector.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Atik, Jeffery","Atik, Jeffery (Loyola Law School Los Angeles)",,"Atik, Jeffery ()",,,,,,,,,,,4,0,,1.24,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102341832,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Initially, it was related to the use of tamsulosin, an alpha adrenergic receptor blocker used in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Subsequently, other alpha adrenergic receptor such as alfuzosin, terazosin and doxazosin alongwith different other class of medications and systemic risk factors were identified. Other class of medications includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and antidepressants. Other risk factors include increasing age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension and decreased preoperative pupil diameter. It is very important for surgeons to identify these risk factors preoperatively and take appropriate preoperative and intraoperative measures to tackle the dreaded complications of IFIS. Sometimes, it is important for an ophthalmologist to work in cooperation with physician and urologist to minimize the complications.

Drawing on rational choice theory, we explain why inflexibility, when seen as a constraint, can ultimately not only enhance welfare but also enable cooperation on algorithmic markets. This illuminates the need to address the inflexibility of contracting algorithms in a nuanced manner, distinguishing between inflexibility as a potentially beneficial constraint on the level of transactions, and inflexibility as a set of systemic risks and changes arising in markets employing inflexible contracting algorithms. Using algorithmic trading in financial markets as an example, we show how the automation of finance has brought about institutional changes in the form of new regulation to hedge against systemic risks from inflexibility. Analyzing the findings through the lens of new institutional economics, we explain how widespread adoption of contract automation can put pressure on institutions to change. We conclude with possible lessons that algorithmic finance can teach to markets deploying algorithmic contracting.","We would like to thank Johan Hombert, Kristian Bondo Hansen, Bo Hee Min, Florian Idelberger, Jaakko Salminen, Daniel Souleles, Konrad Borowicz and three anonymous peer reviewers for generously sharing their insights and giving very valuable comments on earlier versions of the paper.

Linkages between economic growth, development, real estate performance and investment allocations are documented. Long-run regional property performance is not the product of long-run economic growth, and weakly related to indicators of long-run supply and demand.

set-valued functionals, such as quantiles, prediction intervals, and systemic

expected scoring function, and identifiable if it is the unique zero of an
expected identification function; both notions are essential for forecast
ranking and validation, and $M$- and $Z$-estimation. Our framework
distinguishes between exhaustive forecasts, being set-valued and aiming at
correctly specifying the entire functional, and selective forecasts, content
with solely specifying a single point in the correct functional. We establish a
mutual exclusivity result: A set-valued functional can be either selectively
elicitable or exhaustively elicitable or not elicitable at all. Notably, since
quantiles are well known to be selectively elicitable, they fail to be
exhaustively elicitable. We further show that the class of prediction intervals
and Vorob'ev quantiles turn out to be exhaustively elicitable and selectively
identifiable. In particular, we provide a mixture representation of elementary
exhaustive scores, leading the way to Murphy diagrams. We give possibility and
impossibility results for the shortest prediction interval and prediction
intervals specified by an endpoint or a midpoint. We end with a comprehensive

In this sense, this study aims to answer the question of how a centralized clearing agent can compute safety margin requirements to help reduce the systemic risk of the energy futures contracts market in Brazil.   Design/methodology/approach The intermediate steps and specific objectives are to analyze the volatility behavior, identify the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity effects and model the variance of the return series. Based on this, the authors calculate the value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk metrics for the energy futures contracts. As a robustness test, the authors added a peak over threshold methodology from extreme values theory.   Findings In general, monthly products require margins because of their higher variance. With the asymmetrical distribution of returns, the authors needed to consider different maintenance margins for the long and short positions. It was also shown that two guarantee margins were required to secure the contracts as follows: the initial margin and the maintenance margin.

Bothered by this conceptually flawed treatment approach we evaluated the impact of PMR on the treatment of women with four or more involved axillary lymph nodes. We identified 1164 patients treated from 1982 through 1999 with mastectomy. We reviewed the records of the 223 who demonstrated four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Of these 128 were treated by mastectomy only and 95 by PMR. The mastectomy-only group demonstrated a mean tumor size of 3.5 cm, a median of seven axillary nodes involved, and a median of 24.9 nodes harvested. The PMR group had a mean tumor size of 4.3 cm with nine positive nodes out of a median total of 23.3 harvested. The difference in mean tumor size was statistically significant (P = 0.01). The locoregional recurrence (10.9% vs 12.6%), distant recurrence rates (42.2% vs 35.8%), and 5-year survival (51% vs 55%) were not statistically different between the mastectomy-only group versus the PMR group, respectively.

We argue that firm inter-dependencies, as measured by correlations of stock returns, provide an indicator of systemic risk potential. We analyze the dynamics of the stock return correlations of a sample of US large and complex banking organizations (LCBOs) over 1988–1999, and find a significant positive trend in stock return correlations. This finding is consistent with the view that the systemic risk potential in the financial sector appears to have increased over the last decade. In addition, we relate firms' return correlations to their consolidation activity by estimating measures of the consolidation elasticity of correlation. Consolidation at the sample LCBOs appears to have contributed to LCBOs inter-dependencies. However, consolidation elasticities of correlation exhibit substantial time variation, and likely declined in the latter part of the decade. Thus, factors other than consolidation have also been responsible for the upward trend in return correlations.","The authors thank Philipp Hartmann, Erik Heitfield, Garry Schinasi, participants in the IMF&#x27;s Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department Seminar, and participants in the Banks and Systemic Risk Conference held at the Bank of England on May 23–25, 2001 for their very helpful comments.

From this revision, we conclude that, at the present stage, the existing theoretical paradigms need to be adapted to explain the recent surge in international banks' local operations in emerging countries financial sectors. Macroeconomic and risk diversification theories would seem particularly well-suited to explain this reality. The empirical literature on financial FDI has concentrated on bank-specific factors and much less so on macroeconomic determinants, particularly push factors where generally only general FDI literature is available. The survey draws on this literature in those cases where no specific results for financial FDI exist. Finally, the effects of financial FDI on the home country are virtually unknown. The literature on general FDI has focused on employment, trade and investment effects, yet the consequences on the profitability and systemic risk of home's financial system remain a topic for debate.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2003,2003,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"García-Herrero, Alicia; Navia, Daniel","García-Herrero, Alicia (Natixis ; BBVA Research; Bruegel); Navia, Daniel (Banco de España)",,"García-Herrero, Alicia (); Navia, Daniel (Bank of Spain)",Bank of Spain,grid.466509.8,Madrid,,Spain,,,,,,10,0,,2.05,,http://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs22bde2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102203373,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

295,pub.1043093245,10.1057/jbr.2010.14,,,,The regulatory issues raised by credit default swaps,"This article considers the regulatory issues raised by the increased use of credit default swaps (CDSs). It argues that the current extensive over-the-counter trading of CDSs raises problems in terms of the opacity of risk, misaligned incentives in the event of default by reference entities, and concentrations of counterparty risk, each of which requires addressing. Among the proposals discussed are the standardisation of CDSs, the use of central counterparties, the introduction of exchange trading of CDSs, the imposition of capital penalties on bespoke CDSs or mandatory collateralisation, limiting the extent to which CDSs can be used to hedge a position fully, the prohibition of naked CDS protection and the introduction of large exposure counterparty limits. The article concludes that while standardisation and exchange trading of CDSs should be promoted, mandatory collateralisation is preferable to the use of capital penalties. Naked CDS protection buying should be prohibited unless measures can be put in place to ensure that it does not have adverse effects in the event of default by reference entities. Systemic risk in the CDS markets should be addressed through the introduction of large exposure counterparty limits.","The author thanks the Legal Services Department of the European Central Bank for its generous grant that has made this research possible.

A systemic perspective,"The paper lays the empirical foundation for the significance of Crude in explaining the variation in implied volatilities (IVs) of emerging markets nations constituting the MSCI emerging market index. Guided by the significance of Crude as a significant regressor, the study aims to investigate the association of currency IVs with Crude using a connectedness-based approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). The spillover pattern highlights the strong interconnectedness of Asian currencies, with the Taiwanese dollar and Thai Baht feeding the systemic risk, thus the currencies to watch out for the policymakers. An important finding is that the Polish zloty possesses a high spillover risk in the Eastern European economies due to improved economic conditions and a large flow of capital during quantitative easing. On the other hand, Russia is a huge exporter of Crude and shares a limited spillover relationship with Crude, implying domestic macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical risk contribute more to the ruble fall. Based on the spillover pattern of IVs, a portfolio universe selection and weight allocation with dynamic balancing have been devised for investors of the forex market for spillover risk minimization. Findings show that the Chinese Yuan and Chilean Peso are the most favorable currency alongside Crude. However, Indian Rupee serves as the most promising currency pair to be inducted with Crude. The study is particularly beneficial for investors and portfolio managers investing in the forex market to induct the assets in the portfolio to mitigate systemic risk fear, especially during times of distress.","The Authors are thankful to the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR), New Delhi, India for providing a grant of $7500 (INR 5.5 Lac) for the study under the major research Project grant File No. 02/58/GEN/2017-18/RP/Major.",,Energy Economics,,Elsevier,"0140-9883, 1873-6181",,2022-12,2022,,2022-12,116,,106384,Closed,Article,"Kumar, Pawan; Singh, Vipul Kumar","Kumar, Pawan (National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Vihar Lake, P.O.

Drawing on a unique dataset, the paper, for the first time, documents the degree of interconnectedness and systemic risk of the euro area banking system based on bilateral linkages. We then develop a Contagion Mapping (CoMap) methodology to study contagion potential of an exogenous default shock via counterparty credit and funding risks. We construct contagion and vulnerability indices measuring respectively the systemic importance of banks and their degree of fragility. Decomposing the results into the respective contributions of credit and funding shocks provides insights to the nature of contagion which can be used to calibrate bank-specific capital and liquidity requirements and large exposures limits. We empirically confirm that tipping points shifting the euro area banking system from a less vulnerable state to a highly vulnerable state are a non-linear function of the combination of network structures and bank-specific characteristics.","We wish to thank Franklin Allen, Cédric Tille, Beth Klee, Noam Michelson, Mattia Montagna, Jérôme Henry, Eric Schaanning, Caterina Lepore, Daniel Hardy, Tuomas Peltonen, Alberto Giovannini, Barbara Meller, Andrei Sarechev, Niki Anderson, Nuno Silva, and participants of Federal Reserve Board Conference on the Interconnectedness of the Financial System, the ASSA 2019 Conference, the Systemic Risk and Macroprudential CEPR Conference, the Complex Networks 2018 Conference, the MBF 2018 Conference Rome, 6th ECB/CBRT Conference, Credit 2018 Conference Venice, the Banco de Portugal/ECB/ESRB Workshop, the ESRB Interconnectedness Workshop, the Bank of England’s Fire-sales Workshop and ECB, IMF and Bank of Italy’s internal seminars for helpful comments and suggestions.

Typically, an assumption is made about the share of short-term funding that cannot be rolled over and the haircut rate that must be applied to fire sale of assets to meet the immediate liquidity needs. This would result in losses on the trading book, which would then be absorbed by the capital base. We introduce bank-specific funding shortfall rate, ρ i , reflecting precisely the maturity structure of bank i's wholesale funding. In response to a subset of banks defaulting (getting into distress), Y ⊂ Z , and thereby withdrawing funding from other counterparties, bank i faces funding shortfall summed across all banks j ∈ Y using its specific funding shortfall rate, ρ i . (5) ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i ,   w h e r e   ρ i ∈ 0,1   :   ρ i = ∑ j x j , i 30 d a y s ∑ j x j , i =   S h o r t   T e r m   F u n d i n g T o t a l   F u n d i n g We introduce to the model banks’ ability to hold liquidity surplus, which can be used to absorb these shortfalls, at least partially. In order to mitigate banks’ short-term funding risk, regulators have imposed liquidity coverage ratios (LCR) to ensure that banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover liquidity shortages. In practice, for immediate liquidity needs, banks can pledge HQLA as collateral to the central bank for overnight borrowing. From a modelling perspective, this implies that bank i can offset funding shortfall with the new credit line up to its liquidity surplus, γ i . (6) m i n γ i , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i Moreover, the remaining liquidity shortage is computed as: (7) m a x 0 , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i - γ i In our model, a bank is pushed toward a fire sale when it has exhausted emergency credit lines from the central bank, that is, if the remaining liquidity shortage (7) emanating from the funding shock is strictly positive. At this point, we introduce a constraint, θ i , on the amount of remaining assets available to the bank to sell. This constraint sets an upper threshold to how much of the remaining liquidity shortage can be sustained with the fire sale proceeds after accounting for haircuts proportional to a discount rate, δ i . As a result, the deleveraging amounts to the sale of assets is equivalent to Equation (8). (8) m i n 1 1 - δ i m a x 0 , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i - γ i , θ i   ,   w h e r e   δ i ∈ 0,1 As in credit shock, the losses due to the fire sale are absorbed fully by bank i's capital. The other liabilities of the bank decline by the amount of funding shortfall that couldn’t be replenished by central bank loans. The sum of the two declines are matched by the contraction on bank’s assets due to fire sales. (9) ∑ j ∑ k x i j k + a i - m i n 1 1 - δ i m a x 0 , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i - γ i , θ i = c i - δ i m i n 1 1 - δ i m a x 0 , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i - γ i , θ i + ⅆ i + b i + m i n γ i , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i + ∑ j ∈ Z \ Y x j i + ∑ j ∈ Y ( 1 - ρ i ) x j i Overall, the balance sheet of the bank can potentially shrink by a larger factor than the associated capital losses in contrast with the credit shock. On the liabilities side, there is a shift in wholesale funding from other banks to the central bank, as well as an overall decline. (10) ∑ j ∑ k x i j k + a i ' ' = c i ' ' + ⅆ i + b i ' ' + ∑ j ∈ Z \ Y x j i + ∑ j ∈ Y 1 - ρ i x j i Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the transmission of funding shock via bilateral linkages on bank i's balance sheet, when the liquidity surplus is sufficient to meet funding shortfall and when it is insufficient, respectively. While it is helpful to consider credit and funding shocks in isolation, when a bank or a group of banks are in distress, they are likely to default on their obligations and shore up liquidity by withdrawing funding simultaneously. Therefore, we combine the impact of both shocks on bank i's balance sheet to capture the full impact of a distress event. (11) a i + ∑ j ∈ Y ∑ k 1 - λ i j k x i j k - m i n 1 1 - δ i m a x 0 , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i - γ i , θ i + ∑ j ∈ Z \ Y ∑ k x i j k = c i -   ∑ j ∈ Y ∑ k λ i j k x i j k - δ i m i n 1 1 - δ i m a x 0 , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i - γ i , θ i + ⅆ i + b i + m i n γ i , ∑ j ∈ Y ρ i x j i + ∑ j ∈ Z \ Y x j i + ∑ j ∈ Y ( 1 - ρ i ) x j i Funding shortfall refers to the portion of withdrawn funding that is assumed not to be rolled over when the bank providing the funding defaults (or gets into distress). It is calibrated at bank-level using the share of short-term liabilities shorter than 30 days (1 month maturity). The choice of this maturity threshold as baseline calculation is to allow the funding shortfall to be consistent with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which assumes a 30-day liquidity distress scenario. However, this assumption may be relaxed and ρ i can be calibrated on a shorter or longer period depending on the scenario we want to test. For each bank, we use exposure level information retrieved from the concentration of funding template (C.67.00.a) and the large exposure maturity breakdown template (C.30). The former template allows us to retrieve information on the exposures’ amount and maturity breakdown on international banks lending to euro area banks. Therefore, as reported in equation (15), the funding shortfall is calibrated based on the share of exposures in buckets with maturities of less than 30 days over the total amount of funding, aggregated across all reporting banks for whom bank i is a large exposure counterpart. 25 25 Bank i’s large exposure vis-à-vis bank j can be equally thought of as the amount of funding provided by bank i to bank j. (15) ρ i = ∑ j x j , i 30 d a y s ∑ j x j , i = S h o r t   T e r m   F u n d i n g T o t a l   F u n d i n g When no maturity information is available, we use the average maturity to which the reporting banks having an exposure to bank i are lending at to other banks. Therefore, we assume that the maturity information of the reporting banks is more accurate than setting ρ i equal to the average of the sample. This approach allows us to increase heterogeneity in the distribution of the funding shortfall parameter. As we see in Fig. 7 , banks’ short term funding as share of total funding is distributed on the whole range of the maturity breakdown, with banks experiencing an average of 35% of short term funding over total funding.",Journal of Financial Stability,,Elsevier,"1572-3089, 1878-0962",,2021-04,2021,,2021-04,53,,100814,All OA; Green,Article,"Covi, Giovanni; Gorpe, Mehmet Ziya; Kok, Christoffer","Covi, Giovanni (Bank of England, Financial Stability Strategy and Risk Directorate, Stress Test Division, London, United Kingdom); Gorpe, Mehmet Ziya (International Monetary Fund, Monetary and Capital Markets Department, Washington DC, United States); Kok, Christoffer (European Central Bank, Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability Directorate, Stress Test Modelling Division, Frankfurt am Main, Germany)","Covi, Giovanni (Bank of England)","Covi, Giovanni (Bank of England); Gorpe, Mehmet Ziya (International Monetary Fund); Kok, Christoffer (European Central Bank)",European Central Bank; International Monetary Fund; Bank of England,grid.466644.2; grid.453811.a; grid.465255.5,Frankfurt am Main; Washington D.C.; London,; District of Columbia; ,Germany; United States; United Kingdom,,,,,,17,12,,16.87,1.0,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2019/WPIEA2019102.ashx,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132621103,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

By graphically demonstrating eventual economic episodes in the financial sector, this study sets out to illustrate the chronological scenario of economic turning points. The scope of this research is to study the vulnerable aspects of financial instability in Bangladesh and seek possible remedies. Methodology: The Bangladeshi financial market regimes will be constructed based on Hamilton's Markov Switching Model (1989). This paper is the first attempt in utilising a standardised methodology found in business cycle literatures so as to determine the turning points of economic episodes in the Bangladeshi financial dynamic cycle. Main Findings: This study examines the financial crises and economic distress experienced by banks as forms of economic vulnerabilities. Thus, it describes the financial regimes of transition period movements in the context of the vulnerability of the Bangladeshi financial market sector using the Markov Switching Modeling (MSM) Approach and shows ways to possibly achieve recovery. Research Limitations/Implications: This research focuses on the current financial episodes of the economic sector’s dynamic movements in a condensed area, while the selection of a broad financial arena of parameters results in more significant and robust outcomes. Novelty/Originality: Further studies are needed to define and measure the financial cycle concept and its relationship with business cycles, as well as to delineate dynamic models that can offer substantial probabilistic assessments regarding changes in financial cycle regimes. This can significantly develop the capability of the financial market supervisory authorities to forecast macro-prudential systemic risks and to avoid or reduce the consequences of economic crises.

Thus, the prevailing system does not safeguard a sufficient level of stability in the banking system. Scientific studies show that the deposit insurance system should consider not only the risk indicators for individual banks, but it must also consider the systemic risk of banks that affects the stability of the banking system. Hence, the question arises as to whether measurements of systemic risk in a common E.U. risk-based deposit insurance system are a formal necessity or if they are a value-adding process. Expanding the discussion of scientists, this article analyzes how contributions to insurance funds would change the banks of Lithuania following the introduction of the E.U.’s overall risk-based deposit insurance system and after taking into consideration the additional systemic risk. The research results that were obtained provide evidence that the introduction of a risk-based deposit insurance system would redistribute payments to the deposit insurance fund between banks operating in Lithuania, and, thereby, would contribute to a reduction in the negative effects of the deposit insurance system and would improve the stability in the financial system.",,This research received no external funding.,Risks,,MDPI,2227-9091,,2018-12-04,2018,2018-12-04,,6,4,137,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barkauskaite, Aida; Lakstutiene, Ausrine; Witkowska, Justyna","Barkauskaite, Aida (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, 44249 Kaunas, Lithuania;, ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.lt); Lakstutiene, Ausrine (School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, 44249 Kaunas, Lithuania;, ausrine.lakstutiene@ktu.lt); Witkowska, Justyna (Faculty of Economic Sciences, University of Warmia and Mazury, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland;, justyna.witkowska@uwm.edu.pl)","Barkauskaite, Aida (Kaunas University of Technology)","Barkauskaite, Aida (Kaunas University of Technology); Lakstutiene, Ausrine (Kaunas University of Technology); Witkowska, Justyna (University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn)",University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn; Kaunas University of Technology,grid.412607.6; grid.6901.e,Olsztyn; Kaunas,; ,Poland; Lithuania,,,,,,5,3,,2.45,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/6/4/137/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110371249,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Despite strict control of systemic risk factors, a fraction of patients with diabetes develop PDR, suggesting the existence of other potential pathogenic factors underlying PDR. This study aimed to investigate the plasma metabotype of patients with PDR and to identify novel metabolite markers for PDR. Biomarkers identified from this study will provide scientific insight and new strategies for the early diagnosis and intervention of diabetic retinopathy.MethodsA total of 1024 patients with type 2 diabetes were screened. To match clinical parameters between case and control subjects, patients with PDR (PDR, n = 21) or those with a duration of diabetes of ≥10 years but without diabetic retinopathy (NDR, n = 21) were assigned to the present case-control study. Distinct metabolite profiles of serum were examined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).ResultsThe distinct metabolites between PDR and NDR groups were significantly enriched in 9 KEGG pathways (P < 0.05, impact > 0.1), namely, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, caffeine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, purine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, sulfur metabolism, sphingosine metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. A total of 63 altered metabolites played important roles in these pathways. Finally, 4 metabolites were selected as candidate biomarkers for PDR, namely, fumaric acid, uridine, acetic acid, and cytidine. The area under the curve for these biomarkers were 0.96, 0.95, 1.0, and 0.95, respectively.ConclusionsThis study suggested that impairment in the metabolism of pyrimidines, arginine and proline were identified as metabolic dysregulation associated with PDR. And fumaric acid, uridine, acetic acid, and cytidine might be potential biomarkers for PDR. Fumaric acid was firstly reported as a novel metabolite marker with no prior reports of association with diabetes or diabetic retinopathy, which might provide insights into potential new pathogenic pathways for diabetic retinopathy.",We thank LetPub (www.letpub.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.,"This work was supported by the National Key R&D program of China (No.2018YFC0116800), National natural science Foundation of China (No.81561128015) and Basic-Clinical Cooperation Program from Capital Medical University (No. PYZ2018056).

Using returns for which we allow the variance to follow a Markov-Switching GARCH or a Changing-Point GARCH, we first show that over different periods, the topology of the network is highly unstable. In particular, over very recent years, dynamic relationships vanish. Then, expanding on this idea, we analyze patterns of information transmission. Using rolling windows to analyze the topologies of the network in terms of clustering, we show that the nodes' state changes continually, and that the system exhibits a high degree of flickering in information transmission.

1026,pub.1085969416,2614,28599690.0,,,Comparison of Clinical Characteristics of Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment in Pseudophakic and Phakic Eyes.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical profile, systemic risk factors, and characteristics of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in pseudophakic and phakic eyes.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology, Rawalpindi from August 2013 to August 2015.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 164 eyes (96 pseudophakic patients and 68 phakic patients) with RRD were analyzed. Demographic data and associated known risk factors of study population were acquired. Retinal examination was done by single experienced retinal surgeon using indirect ophthalmoscopy for type of retinal break, location and number of retinal breaks, status of macula, morphological extent of RRD and retinal degenerations. All the findings were endorsed on a pre-devised proforma.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients in pseudophakic and phakic groups was 61.18 ±10.39 and 59.27 ±9.57 years, respectively. Frequency of male patients in pseudophakic and phakic groups was 74% and 57.4%, respectively. Mean axial length in pseudophakic and phakic groups was 23.13 ±2.18 mm and 21.9 ±2.01 mm, respectively. Difference in axial length and gender distribution between two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Difference in frequency of patients with history of hypertension and myopia between two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Characteristics of RRD (type, location and number of retinal breaks, macula status, and extent of RRD) between groups were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: RRD is more common in pseudophakic patients with male gender, increased axial length, myopia, and hypertension.",,,Journal of College of Physicians And Surgeons Pakistan,,,"1022-386X, 1681-7168","Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myopia, Degenerative; Pakistan; Phakic Intraocular Lenses; Pseudophakia; Retinal Degeneration; Retinal Detachment; Retinal Perforations; Visual Acuity; Vitrectomy",2017-05,2017,,2017-05,27,5,288-291,Closed,Article,"Mukhtar, Muhammad Ahsan; Mehboob, Mohammad Asim; Islam, Qamar Ul; Ishaq, Mazhar","Mukhtar, Muhammad Ahsan (Department of Eye, Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology, Rawalpindi.); Mehboob, Mohammad Asim (Department of Eye, PNS Shifa Naval Hospital, Karachi.); Islam, Qamar Ul (Department of Eye, PNS Shifa Naval Hospital, Karachi.); Ishaq, Mazhar (Department of Eye, Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology, Rawalpindi.)",,"Mukhtar, Muhammad Ahsan (); Mehboob, Mohammad Asim (); Islam, Qamar Ul (); Ishaq, Mazhar ()",,,,,,,,,,,2,0,0.18,0.54,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085969416,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision,Eye,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

The FSAP and financial regulation at the EU member state level are derived from a complicated mix of policy objectives. Decisions to regulate are based on a very broad spectrum of analysis and research. Important analytical contributions come from financial economics and company and capital market law. Within the framework of the stated policy objectives, both economists and jurists have analysed the need for and the likely effect of different types of regulatory instruments. The aim of the present paper is to combine regulatory objectives and research contributions in a systematic way. The classification system developed by the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) is applied to categorise the relevant research contributions. Observations in a so-called ‘Objectives/Research Category Matrix’ based on a large sample of references reveal some interesting patterns. There seem to be some systematic differences in the objective orientation of researchers belonging to different JEL-categories. Different academic disciplines approach issues of regulation in different ways and with different analytical paradigms. Researchers whose publications are classified in JEL-category G. Financial Economics, have particularly focused on protection against systemic risk, ensuring company efficiency and ensuring market efficiency. Researchers belonging to JEL-category K.

Hence, they have not responded to financial illiteracy, which exacerbated the recent financial crisis. Investor education may be considered as a systemic risk management tool for future financial crises and, especially, financial literacy can drive a wedge between the regulation and the prevention of severe financial crises based on expected benefits versus losses.

The model analyzes the impact of a financial institution failure on the distribution of losses in the financial system. The fundamental idea is that bank loss rates may be decomposed into a level, momentum, systematic and systemic component. Financial institutions fail when unexpected losses exceed the capital buffer and the release of capital allocated to credits. Failed financial institutions pass these loss exceedances on to creditors, deposit insurance schemes or the general public. The benefits of the presented model framework are (i) the identification of systemically relevant financial institutions, and (ii) the measurement of the size of safety nets in terms of attachment likelihood and expected losses given attachment. The model is generally applicable as it does not rely on financial market data. The empirical evidence presented is based on information collected by US prudential regulators from 1997 to 2012.

ABSTRACT: Between 2015 and 2019, Brazil recorded the two most serious disasters involving mining dams of the 21st century. The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of these disasters as systemic risks. They involve from global and national processes related to social determinants that materialize in a complex system of dams distributed throughout the country with their intrinsic risks. When they occur, result in a set of impacts with potential damage and immediate effects combined with secondary and tertiary impacts that can trigger chain reactions, which promote risk factors of heterogeneous and complex occurrence. Approaching these events from the point of view of systemic risk allows for a broader understanding of both the singularity of each of these disasters and their multiple exposure, risk and disease processes, as well as the structural characteristics in which social, political processes and dynamics and economic factors reproduce in multiple territories a common pattern of disasters and their effects.

The outcomes in those with PAD in population studies reflect and extend the findings from clinical studies of PAD, confirming that older adults with PAD are disabled and have a high risk for CVD and total mortality. With the aging of the population, the prevalence of PAD is increasing. It is common in both men and women and increases in prevalence with age, such that at least 12% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older will have significant disease on noninvasive testing, most without classic intermittent claudication. Furthermore, PAD is strongly related to other manifestations of CVD and its risk factors. Those with PAD identified in epidemiologic studies have a two- to three-fold risk in CVD morbidity and mortality. Current treatment goals for PAD patients include improving function, primarily using exercise and medical therapy, and reduction of systemic risk and can be extended to those identified by screening. In addition, PAD must be thought of as a marker of advanced systemic atherosclerosis. Inasmuch as the risk of CVD and mortality in those with PAD is similar to those with a history of MI or stroke, those with PAD can be approached with the same measures for secondary CVD prevention as recommended for MI and stroke survivors. A simple bedside measure of the AAI can be used to improve the detection of PAD in clinical practice. Although there is no study that shows directly that screening and preventive treatment will reduce complications of PAD, a preventive approach in PAD patients is likely to improve overall survival, reduce MI, and will, perhaps, also reduce the risk of disabling leg pain and amputation. Future descriptions of the natural history of PAD in ongoing cohort studies may indicate that this is already beginning to occur.",,,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,,Wiley,"0002-8614, 1532-5415","Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arterial Occlusive Diseases; Arteriosclerosis; Disabled Persons; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Prevalence; Primary Prevention; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution",2000-09,2000,2015-04-27,2000-09,48,9,1157-1162,Closed,Article,"Fried, Linda; Newman, Anne B.","Fried, Linda (); Newman, Anne B.

The variance risk premium proxies risk aversion. The contribution to the literature is twofold. First, this is the first study estimating not only the common component, but also indices of directional connectedness among variance risk premia. Second, it is the first to estimate the interconnections by means of a FIVAR model, in order to account for long memory. Our analysis indicates measures of total and directional connectedness unlike those that would be obtained with the use of a short memory VAR. These differences arise when the focus is on market turmoil periods and on forecast horizons of thirty days. Future research evaluating spillovers among long memory series can benefit from our results. Policy-makers should take these interconnections into account when adopting effective macroeconomic policies.","We thank Sushanta Mallick (the Editor) and two anonymous referees for the helpful comments, which have led to a significant improvement of the paper.

In this study, we suggest a “too central to fail” systemic risk measure, Rank, using the PageRank algorithm. Then, adopting a centrality perspective, we compare this measure, which effectively captures network relationships among financial institutions, with other well-known systemic risk measures, conditional value at risk (CoVaR) and marginal expected shortfall (MES). First, we model a simulation that generates bilateral connections among financial institutions. Second, we use real market data representing United States financial institutions. We show that Rank can capture the network structure among financial institutions better than CoVaR and MES. Further, Rank does not have procyclical properties; therefore, it is not dependent on market conditions. This study contributes to the development of a timely measure using publicly available market data. The measure also overcomes the shortcomings of the balance sheet-based approach, which is subject to time lags, because financial institutions release balance sheets quarterly basis. We also include equity and liability-type assets, in which systemic risks mainly propagate through intricately connected liability obligations. The findings will help regulators and policy-makers understand the implications of monitoring systemic risks from a network perspective.","The authors thank the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Whereas optimal oral health prior to initiate pARs is recognized as critically important for minimizing ONJ risk, the efficacy of preventive/maintenance measures in patients who are taking pARs is understudied. Rice rats fed a standard diet (STD), rich in insoluble fiber, develop localized periodontitis. STD-rats with localized periodontitis treated with ZOL for 18-24 wk develop ONJ. Hence, we hypothesized that controlling/preventing localized periodontitis in the ZOL-treated rats, reduces ONJ occurrence.
METHODS: We used two approaches to attempt reducing periodontitis prevalence: 1) periodontal cleaning (PC); and 2) replacing the STD-diet with a nutritionally-equivalent diet high in soluble fiber (SF). 75 four-week-old male rats were weight-randomized into five groups (n = 15) in a 24-week experiment. Three groups ate the STD-diet and two the high SF-diet. STD-diet groups received intravenous (IV) vehicle (VEH) q4wks (STD + VEH), 80 μg/kg ZOL q4wks IV (STD + ZOL), or ZOL plus PC q2wks (STD + ZOL + PC). The SF-diet groups received VEH (SF + VEH) or ZOL (SF + ZOL). Jaws were processed for histopathology and evaluated for ONJ prevalence and tissue-level periodontitis.
RESULTS: 1) 40% of STD + VEH rats developed maxillary localized periodontitis with no ONJ; 2) 50% of STD + ZOL rats developed ONJ; 3) 7% of STD + ZOL + PC rats developed ONJ (p < 0.01 vs. STD + ZOL); and 4) one SF + ZOL rat developed localized periodontitis, and no SF + VEH or SF + ZOL rats developed ONJ (p < 0.001 vs. STD + ZOL).
CONCLUSIONS: 1) Periodontal cleaning in ZOL-treated rats decreases localized periodontitis severity and reduces ONJ prevalence; and 2) feeding a SF-diet to ZOL-treated rats reduces both incidence of localized periodontitis and ONJ. Our data indicates strong oral microbial community shifts according to oral health condition and trends in the shifts associated with diet.","This research was supported by NIH grant R01DE023783-01A from the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) and, in-part, with resources provided by the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System.

The main aim of this paper is to put the macroeconomic role of currency reserve accumulation for four Asian economies under closer scrutiny. The key question is whether accumulating currency reserves is beneficial from a long‐run perspective. Based on a vector error correction approach, we start by analysing long‐run steady‐state relationships between currency reserves, exchange rates against the US dollar, real GDP and interest rates. Our findings show that cumulated currency reserve shocks significantly affect real GDP.

wave of research on systemic risk analytics, yet it still faces challenges in
measurability. This paper models systemic risk by tapping into expert knowledge
of financial supervisors. We decompose systemic risk into a number of
interconnected segments, for which the level of vulnerability is measured. The
system is modeled in the form of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), in which nodes
represent vulnerability in segments and links their interconnectedness. A main
problem tackled in this paper is the aggregation of values in different
interrelated nodes of the network to obtain an estimate systemic risk. To this
end, the Choquet integral is employed for aggregating expert evaluations of
measures, as it allows for the integration of interrelations among factors in
the aggregation process. The approach is illustrated through two applications
in a European setting. First, we provide an estimation of systemic risk with a
of pan-European set-up. Second, we estimate country-level risks, allowing for a
more granular decomposition. This sets a starting point for the use of the

505,pub.1144507236,10.1287/opre.2021.2234,,,,Systemic Risk-Driven Portfolio Selection,"How can we construct portfolios that perform well in the face of systemic events? The global financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have highlighted the importance of accounting for extreme form of risks. In “Systemic Risk-Driven Portfolio Selection,” Capponi and Rubtsov investigate the design of portfolios that trade off tail risk and expected growth of the investment. The authors show how two well-known risk measures, the value-at-risk and the conditional value-at-risk, can be used to construct portfolios that perform well in the face of systemic events. The paper uses U.S. stock data from the S&P500 Financials Index and Canadian stock data from the S&P/TSX Capped Financial Index, and it demonstrates that portfolios accounting for systemic risk attain higher risk-adjusted expected returns, compared with well-known benchmark portfolio criteria, during times of market downturn.
We consider an investor who trades off tail risk and expected growth of the investment. We measure tail risk through the portfolio’s expected losses conditioned on the occurrence of a systemic event: financial market loss being exactly at, or at least at, its value-at-risk (VaR) level and investor’s portfolio losses being above their conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) level. We decompose the solution to the investment problem in terms of the Markowitz mean-variance portfolio and an adjustment for systemic risk.

The design of complex adaptive systems often, if not always, occurs in a context that is uncertain. In addition to the complexity of the system, the systems both affect and are influenced by a social environment containing a large variety of actors. Methods and processes that study the design of such types of systems can help scholars and practitioners to better understand, design and manage complex adaptive systems. The aim in this paper is to provide a methodology useful for designing and controlling systems developed to solve complex adaptive problems. In this paper, the complex systems life cycle understanding and design framework are introduced as an approach for satisficing of systems at conceptual design. To illustrate the methodology, a financial systemic risks infrastructure systems architecture development case study is presented.

274,pub.1120664427,10.1108/jfrc-04-2018-0061,,,,FDI in Africa: potential implications of Brexit on South Africa’s financial sector,"Purpose
                    This paper aims to investigate whether any potential weakening of the UK’s financial sector, as a result of Brexit, will have a negative impact on South Africa’s financial sector given the close ties between the countries’ financial systems. This paper seeks to also argue that Brexit may provide an opportunity for South Africa to pursue new trade linkages with other countries in Africa and Asia.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This paper is a review of relevant sources from foreign direct investment (FDI) and international economic literature. It analyses comparative and cross-disciplinary research and examines the current trends in the legal and economic climate in South Africa – within the context of economic growth and FDI inflows patterns.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    This paper finds that Brexit does not pose a systemic risk to South Africa’s financial system. This paper also finds that South Africa’s recent policy changes may serve as obstacles to South Africa attracting new FDI.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The implications of Brexit on the investment in the economy of African countries are under-researched, and this paper provides an additional contribution to the euro-centric discussion of the ramifications of Brexit on the economic developments in the financial sector after Britain’s exit.

Cross-Country Evidence from Bitcoin Markets,"I investigate the effects of social technologies related to governance on cross-country differences in Bitcoin prices. Investors pay a persistent premium over global prices in countries with less economic freedom, particularly when there exist foreign exchange and capital controls limiting investment freedom. Using the Heritage Foundation’s Economic Freedom Index and associated macroeconomic time-series, I find that a 10 point increase in the index leads to a 7.5 percent decrease in premium. Of the component indices, Financial Freedom has the largest marginal effect in that a 10 point improvement in its value decreases prices by 5.3 percent. From this perspective, Bitcoin can be seen as a disaster asset offering a new channel to evade domestic jurisdiction repression, a process resembling imperfect markets for catastrophe insurance inducing unexpectedly high premiums. Finally, a natural question arises as to whether this finding can be extended to other assets, in other words, whether endogenous social technologies effect systemic risk and manifest in the pricing kernel.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Viglione, Robert","Viglione, Robert (University of South Carolina - Department of Finance)",,"Viglione, Robert ()",,,,,,,,,,,20,3,,8.12,15.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102441139,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims

However, consistently missing from drug narratives is a deeper engagement with young people themselves on why they use drugs and an understanding of the social, political, economic and cultural forces that shape their interactions with drugs. By engaging with the lived experiences of young people in the Myanmar city of Taunggyi, this paper offers new insights into the everyday pathways and practices through which systemic risk factors – poverty, large-scale local drug production and poor welfare provision – materialise into drug harms. This paper draws attention to three factors that shape these pathways: first, the role that drug-selling and drug consumption plays in the coping strategies that people deploy in an environment of economic hardship; second, the intersections between drug use and gendered conceptions of youth; and, third, the everyday institutional practices of local authorities. Exploring young people’s testimonies offers a grounded perspective for considering what can be done to reduce drug harms in a context where the structural determinants of drug risks are deeply entrenched and, in the context of post-coup Myanmar, likely to worsen.","We are grateful to the people in Taunggyi who shared their insights and life stories with us.

In this informal analysis and design proposal, we describe how infrastructure for digital assets can serve as a useful monetary and fiscal policy tool and an enabler of existing tools in the future, particularly during crises, while aligning the trajectory of financial technology innovation toward a brighter future. We propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both internet purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. We also propose an approach to digital currency that would allow for more efficient and transparent clearing and settlement, implementation of monetary and fiscal policy, and management of systemic risk. The digital currency could be implemented as central bank digital currency (CBDC), or it could be issued by the government and collateralized by public funds or Treasury assets. Our proposed architecture allows both manifestations and would be operated by banks and other money services businesses, operating within a framework overseen by government regulators.

The shift from bank-based to market-based financial systems and from Deferred Net Systems to liquidity-demanding Real-Time Gross Settlement of payments explains some of the shortcomings of traditional liquidity risk management. Although liquidity regulations do exist, they still are in an early stage of development and discussion. Moreover, no all connotations of liquidity are equally addressed. Unlike market and funding liquidity, intraday liquidity has been absent from financial regulation, and has appeared only recently, after the crisis. This paper addresses the measurement of Large-Value Payment System’s intraday liquidity risk. Based on the generation of bivariate Poisson random numbers for simulating the minute-by-minute arrival of received and executed payments, each financial institution’s intraday payments time-varying volume and degree of synchrony (i.e. timing) is modeled. To model intraday payments’ uncertainty allows for overseeing participants’ intraday behavior; assessing their ability to fulfill intraday payments at a certain confidence level; identifying participants non-resilient to changes in payments’ timing mismatches; estimating intraday liquidity buffers. Vis-à-vis the increasing importance of liquidity risk as a source of systemic risk, and the recent regulatory amendments, results are useful for financial authorities and institutions.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2012,2012,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"León, Carlos","León, Carlos (Banco de la República (Central Bank of Colombia); Tilburg University - Center for Economic Research (CentER))",,"León, Carlos (Tilburg University)",Tilburg University,grid.12295.3d,Tilburg,Noord-Brabant,Netherlands,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102345016,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Evidence also supports the notion that too much sitting can increase all-cause mortality and risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Moreover, there is evidence that daily MVPA may not offset negative effects of sedentary behavior on systemic risk factors. We extend the discussion to brain structure and function and argue that while MVPA is recognized as a protective behavior against age-related dementia, sedentary behavior may also be an important contributor to brain health and even counteract the benefits of MVPA due to overlapping or interacting mechanistic pathways.

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-nine patients with glaucoma with an isolated IPFS and 53 patients with an isolated INS.
METHODS: On the basis of 2 reliable, consistent 24-2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm standard visual fields (VFs), 2 groups of patients with glaucoma were studied: those with an IPFS in 1 hemifield (≥3 adjacent points with P<5% within the central 10 degrees of fixation, ≥1 point with P<1% lying at the innermost paracentral points, and no VF abnormality outside the central 10 degrees) and those with an INS in 1 hemifield (≥3 adjacent points with P<5% in the nasal periphery outside 10 degrees of fixation, the nasal-most point with P<1%, and no VF abnormality within the central 10 degrees). Clinical characteristics and systemic factors were recorded from charts and compared between the 2 groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maximum untreated intraocular pressure (IOP), disc hemorrhage (DH) detection during follow-up, systemic risk factors, and VF mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD).
RESULTS: Maximum untreated IOP (21.6±4.5 vs. 28.3±9.6 mmHg; P<0.001) was significantly lower, and frequency of DH detection (44% vs. 17%; P=0.001) and systemic risk factors (hypotension, migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon, and sleep apnea; 16%, 23%, 24%, and 9% vs. 0%, 4%, 9%, and 0%; P=0.001, 0.002, 0.025, and 0.030, respectively) were significantly higher in patients with an IPFS than in patients with an INS. There were no significant differences in age, gender, family history of glaucoma, refractive error, central corneal thickness, and disc area between the 2 groups (all P>0.1). Mean deviation was similar between the 2 groups (P=0.346), but PSD was significantly greater in the IPFS group than in the INS group (P=0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with an IPFS differ from those with an INS.

Investor sentiment has incremental power to explain stock return co-movements, which indicates that these stocks would perform higher (lower) excess returns when investors are bullish (bearish).Our findings support a role for investor sentiment in the formation of return and the change of investor sentiment should be taken as an important systemic risk in asset pricing and portfolio management.",,,Systems Engineering Procedia,,Elsevier,2211-3819,,2012,2012,,2012,3,,166-171,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Changsheng, Hu; Yongfeng, Wang","Changsheng, Hu (Wuhan University, Wuhan(430072), China); Yongfeng, Wang (Wuhan University, Wuhan(430072), China)","Yongfeng, Wang (Wuhan University)","Changsheng, Hu (Wuhan University); Yongfeng, Wang (Wuhan University)",Wuhan University,grid.49470.3e,Wuhan,,China,,,,,,14,7,,6.32,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sepro.2011.11.023,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028217876,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Clinical Research,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

To that end, the ΔCoVaR of 10 sectors is estimated for the United States, the UK and Germany using a quantile regression. The estimated ΔCoVaRs of the sectors are subsequently tested for significance and dominance to classify sectors as systemically relevant and to obtain a formal ranking of the sectors in terms of contribution to systemic risk. We divide the observation period from 1999 to 2013 into four sub-periods and determine that sector dominance changes between the sub-periods. We identify a weak link between ΔCoVaR and VaR and find that ΔCoVaR increases disproportionately between the periods. Furthermore, we observed that even the collapse of a systemically important institution does not cause main risk indicators to soar when the financial system is stable or at least is considered to be stable. The results support the findings of previous papers that suggest the use of different policy tools or a combination thereof, depending on the phase of systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Riedle, Thorsten","Riedle, Thorsten (University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent Business School, Students)",,"Riedle, Thorsten (University of Kent)",University of Kent,grid.9759.2,Canterbury,Kent,United Kingdom,,,,,,2,0,,0.81,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102455713,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

As well as the underlying crises, innovative concepts to regulate and supervise financial institutions are still unfolding, leading to new organizations as well as new rules. While many of the institutional responses are of a general nature, specific institutional change is directed at selected financial intermediaries. While small in number, Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) are, by their very nature, of seminal importance. First of all, this analysis puts SIFI regulation into perspective, before identifying two critical pillars of any SIFI rulebook. Based thereon, it is shown that the current European approach seems rather ill-conceived, as it lacks thorough justification, reasoning, and structure, and is thus prone to causing undesirable market processes in the future. This segues into the discussion of alternative approaches to the regulatory treatment of SIFIs that could lead upcoming institutional change in a reasonable direction.","This paper was originally prepared for, and presented at, the HTW Berlin/University of Oslo Research Seminar on “The European Institutional Responses to the Challenges of Supervising Financial Markets” in Berlin, Germany, in December 2014.

In the same crisis, several distressed banks were bailed out by states with even more banks receiving financial aids from governments. Using a unique data sample of 100 announcements of US mortgage banks between 2006 and 2009, this paper provides em-pirical evidence that isolated failures of US mortgage banks caused significant contagion effects in the US financial system. Conversely, especially the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led to significant positive valuation effects at rival banks. In the cross-sectional analyses, contrary to previous studies in the literature on past financial crises, we find evi-dence for pure contagion effects following mortgage bank failures and rational valuation effects following bailouts. These results indicate that several of the failures of US mortgage banks during the subprime crisis caused irrational contagion in the US financial system thus justifying government intervention.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Weiss, Gregor N.

While the earlier literature found that scale economies are exhausted beyond a modest size – no larger than $100 billion and usually much smaller – a number of recent studies have found scale economies beyond this point, in fact, economies that increase with size. Based on a model that appropriately accounts for endogenous risk-taking and controls for any cost-of-funding advantages conferred on large banks, we find that technological factors, not advantages in funding costs, account for their scale economies. The literature does not indicate whether these benefits of larger size outweigh the potential costs in terms of systemic risk that large scale may impose on the financial system. However, if public policy considerations imply that society would be better off with smaller financial institutions, restrictions that limit the size of financial institutions, if effective, may put large banks at a competitive disadvantage in global markets where competitors are not similarly constrained. Moreover, size restrictions may not be effective since they work against market forces and create incentives for firms to avoid them. Avoiding the restrictions could thereby push risk-taking outside of the more regulated financial sector without necessarily reducing systemic risk. If such limits were imposed, intensive monitoring for such risks would be required. These factors need to be considered when evaluating policies concerning financial institution scale.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hughes, Joseph P.; Mester, Loretta J.","Hughes, Joseph P.

175,pub.1123357838,10.2139/ssrn.3492968,,,,Towards a European Legal Framework for Loan-Originating Funds,"Over the last few years, the European AIF industry has witnessed a surge of interest in loan-originating funds. Both regulatory and economic aspects have been driving this trend. The tighter regulation and increased capital requirements imposed by Basel III on traditional lending banks has reduced the capacity for banks to issue loans. In particular, this holds true for issuing loans to SMEs. Unlike large corporates, SMEs do not have the possibility of a wide range of financing options, such as bonds and listed debt instruments. Given the dependence of European SMEs on bank financing, this created a massive gap in the financing market. Furthermore, institutional investors have been looking to diversity their assets in the search for yield in a low-interest rate environment. This is where European loan-originating fund managers have successfully been stepping in. The current main problem for loan-originating funds in the EEA is that Member States have implemented CRD IV in different ways that restricts loan-originating fund managers in granting loans to SMEs in various EEA Member States. Some Member States take a rather strict approach and consider the origination of loans as a pure banking activity (the so-called ‘banking monopoly’), whereas others also allow non-banking entities to grant loans in their domestic markets. This causes a fragmented landscape for loan-originating funds in which loan-originating fund managers are, in practice, forced to strategically focus themselves on a few (big) EEA domestic markets. As a response to loan-originating funds gaining traction with the EEA, a number of EEA Member States have opened up their ‘banking monopoly’ to boost lending to SMEs by loan-originating fund managers. Despite having the same objective, the regimes on the national level are not necessarily consistent and the current ‘goldplating’ of national AIFMD product laws makes the pan-EU origination of loans for loan-originating fund managers challenging. Furthermore, the regulatory strings attached to the ELTIFR, EuVECAR and EuSEFR have so far offered little help in remedying this fragmented landscape.In an attempt to investigate the current landscape, ESMA conducted research into national loan- originating fund product regimes and issued an opinion related to that. Although the mood is reasonably optimistic, no harmonized EU proposal is yet in place.This contribution seeks to contribute by developing pan-EU standards to facilitate the growth of lending to SMEs and soliciting capital from EEA investors by pan-European loan-originating funds. To that end, section 2 discusses the differences between 'loan funds', loan-originating funds' and 'loan-participating funds'. Section 3 focuses on the EU banking law restrictions, as implemented by Member States under their CRD IV national implementations, for loan-originating funds and section 4 on the differences between loan-originating funds versus banks in terms of investor versus deposit protection and systemic risk. Section 5 analyses the current fragmented European loan-originating fund framework. Section 6 proposes a coherent level-playing field European legal framework for loan-originating funds to create a viable EU market for such funds and section 7 concludes.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hooghiemstra, Sebastiaan Niels","Hooghiemstra, Sebastiaan Niels (NautaDutilh - NautaDutilh, Luxembourg)",,"Hooghiemstra, Sebastiaan Niels ()",,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,1.15,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123357838,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Methods : abstract-logical, analytical methods.   Results : in recent years, electronic retail payment mechanisms, especially e-commerce and card payments at the point of sale, have increasingly replaced cash in many developed countries. As a result, societies are losing a critical public retail payment option, and retail consumers are losing important rights associated with using cash. To address this concern, we propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both e-commerce purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless.  The article shows the advantages of cash payments compared to non-cash ones and defines the possibility to transform these advantages into the central bank digital currencies. The disputable issues of commercial banks development under the spread of digital currencies are discussed. The architecture of digital currencies is described, including distributed ledgers technology. It was shown that, for the digital currency to function effectively, it is necessary to include the privacy of end-users into its architecture; measures to achieve that are determined.  Scientific novelty : the approached proposed in the article should be used to develop the digital currencies infrastructure. It should be government-backed, privately-operated and ensure that every transaction is registered by a bank or money services business, relying upon non-custodial wallets backed by privacy-enhancing technology, such as blind signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure that transaction counterparties are not revealed. This approach can also facilitate more efficient and transparent clearing, settlement, and management of systemic risk. We argue that our system can restore and preserve the salient features of cash, including privacy, owner-custodianship, fungibility, and accessibility, while also preserving fractional reserve banking and the existing two-tiered banking system.   Practical significance : the proposed approach can be applied in the practical organization of perform monetary transactions using digital currencies.

Within the context of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), risk is commonly referred to as beta. The CAPM offers a way of theoretically splitting the risk inherent in holding a portfolio of investments into two different sorts of risk, systematic and specific risks. Beta seeks to calculate the specific risk of a particular asset, which is the risk additional to the market portfolio risk. The market portfolio risk is the systemic risk incurred by investing in the individual asset. However, there are serious theoretical problems, both arithmetical and conceptual, with beta. There is in any event no such thing as absolute risk as two investors with different circumstances are likely to view the same investment in different ways. Therefore any attempt to define and analyze ‘risk’ must take into account this relativity. All traditional measures of risk use as their input periodic returns and all they can measure is something that is irrelevant to the needs of real world investors.

In a two-country model, correlated asset fire sales by banks generate systemic risk across national financial markets. Absent coordination, national regulators choose inefficiently low levels of macro-prudential regulation. Thus, symmetric countries always benefit from relinquishing their authority to a central regulator that establishes uniform regulations across countries. I also consider the separate case of asymmetric countries: while there is a limit to coordination when countries are sufficiently asymmetric in a single dimension, existence of asymmetries in multiple dimensions might actually relax this limit or even eliminate it.",,,Journal of International Economics,,Elsevier,"0022-1996, 1873-0353",,2016-03,2016,,2016-03,99,,192-222,All OA; Green,Article,"Kara, Gazi Ishak","Kara, Gazi Ishak (Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551, United States)",,"Kara, Gazi Ishak (Federal Reserve Board of Governors)",Federal Reserve Board of Governors,grid.431393.f,Washington D.C.,District of Columbia,United States,,,,,,27,12,,10.73,,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201387/201387pap.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046475641,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,,,,,,C16 Economics and Econometrics,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

A common method for this purpose, though only correct when returns are iid normal, is the square-root-of-time rule where an estimated quantile of a return distribution is scaled to a lower frequency by the square-root of the time horizon. The aim of this paper is to examine time scaling of risk when returns follow a jump diffusion process. It is argued that a jump diffusion is well-suited for the modeling of systemic risk, which is the raison d'etre of the Basel capital adequacy proposals. We demonstrate that the square-root-of-time rule leads to a systematic underestimation of risk, whereby the degree of underestimation worsens with the time horizon, the jump intensity and the confidence level. As a result, even if the square-root-of-time rule has widespread applications in the Basel Accords, it fails to address the objective of the Accords.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2005,2005,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Danielsson, Jon; Zigrand, Jean-Pierre","Danielsson, Jon (London School of Economics - Systemic Risk Centre); Zigrand, Jean-Pierre (London School of Economics - Department of Finance, Systemic Risk Centre, and Financial Markets Group)",,"Danielsson, Jon (); Zigrand, Jean-Pierre ()",,,,,,,,,,,12,0,,2.78,,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24827/1/dp439.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102205042,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The pace of such reform accelerated markedly in recent years to help stabilize the Japanese financial system in the face of systemic risk, be it due to the failure of the housing loan companies (the jusen) or other major institutions, such as Yamaichi Securities and the city bank Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. The evolution of local deposit insurance arrangements to cope with such events is explained here and an assessment of the policy responses is provided. The part played by deposit insurance in alleviating the pressures currently experienced by the Japanese banking sector also is addressed.

256,pub.1022114709,10.2202/1935-1682.2226,,,,Three Initiatives Enhancing the Mortgage Market and Promoting Financial Stability,"In recent years, the government has greatly extended its reach into the mortgage markets with the goals of (1) mitigating the deadweight losses associated with mortgage foreclosures, (2) promoting affordable homeownership, and (3) providing low cost mortgage financing. In this paper, we identify three innovations-one in each of these areas-that could be made to the American mortgage market that would help obtain the government's objectives while enhancing financial market stability-particularly if all are done together. These three innovations are: (1) “buy your own mortgage"" options, (2) variable maturity mortgages, and (3) creation of a government mortgage bond insurer, with an emphasis on insuring covered bonds as well as GSE debt. The first innovation would allow homebuyers to repurchase their mortgage at the “market value"" of their homes when they move, thereby helping society avoid some of the deadweight losses associated with unnecessary foreclosures. The second innovation would provide a mortgage that could promote affordable housing without unduly raising the default risks of low- and moderate-income families. The third innovation would help create a variety of financing options for mortgages in the United States. Moreover, it could be integrated into the current system of mortgage financing, which would include government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), in a manner that would help the government manage the systemic risks associated with the quasi-government backing of mortgage credit and mortgage insurance. In particular, we propose that the government explicitly insure pre-designated financial instruments used to fund mortgage credit (such as covered bonds and GSE debt) by creating a government-backed insurance fund similar to that currently used for deposits.",,,The B E Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy,,De Gruyter,"2194-6108, 1935-1682",,2009-03-24,2009,2009-03-24,,9,3,,Closed,Article,"Hancock, Diana; Passmore, Wayne","Hancock, Diana (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, diana.hancock@frb.gov); Passmore, Wayne (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, wpassmore@frb.gov)",,"Hancock, Diana (Federal Reserve Board of Governors); Passmore, Wayne (Federal Reserve Board of Governors)",Federal Reserve Board of Governors,grid.431393.f,Washington D.C.,District of Columbia,United States,,,,,,14,0,,4.09,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022114709,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities,dims

We quantify systemic risk as possible risk spillovers from individual firms to the economy by taking into account time-varying linkages between the firm and the economy. Based on a novel dataset that combines data on international trade and foreign direct investments with daily stock data for 67 Dutch listed companies from 2006–2015, our results indicate that high systemic risk contributions are not only present in the financial sector, but also occur in other sectors of the economy. We find that firms within the financial sector are more capable than non-financial firms of reverting to their pre-financial crisis level of systemic risk contribution. Having examined the potential role globalization fulfills in determining systemic risk, we find two main opposing effects. First, firms in internationally trade-intensive sectors contribute less to systemic risk than firms in sectors with low trade intensity. Second, systemic risk rises when firms are engaged in foreign direct investment activity, suggesting that international networks and global supply chains contribute to systemic risk propagation. Our empirical results imply that macro-prudential policy aimed at monitoring systemic risk should be extended to non-financial sectors and should take into consideration globalization measures, such as foreign direct investments and global supply chains.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

We systematically explain the role that duplex banking networks play in different aspects of risk contagion. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we conclude that asymmetric information interaction would increase the inflexibility of the system, which leads to liquidity shortage and possibly the collapse of the whole market. The weakness of systemic risk in the interior of the complex banking system can be characterized by the partial discount factor using illiquid assets in the information network. By improving the connectedness of the information network of the duplex networks, the spread of contagion can be partially slowed.",,"This research is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under projects [grant number 71671193], and [grant number 71371022] and Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics.",Quantitative Finance,,Taylor & Francis,"1469-7688, 1469-7696",,2017-03-15,2017,2017-03-15,2017-09-02,17,9,1435-1445,Closed,Article,"Ding, Ding; Han, Liyan; Yin, Libo","Ding, Ding (School of Economics & Management, Beihang University, 37 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China); Han, Liyan (School of Economics & Management, Beihang University, 37 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China); Yin, Libo (School of Finance, Central University of Finance and Economics, 39 South College Road, Haidian District, Beijing, China)","Yin, Libo (Central University of Finance and Economics)","Ding, Ding (Beihang University); Han, Liyan (Beihang University); Yin, Libo (Central University of Finance and Economics)",Beihang University; Central University of Finance and Economics,grid.64939.31; grid.411054.5,Beijing; Beijing,; ,China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8324736; grant.8320322; grant.8319417,71671193; 71401193; 71371022,17,9,,7.29,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084165885,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Credit relationships (links) evolve endogenously via a fitness mechanism based on agents’ performance. By changing the agent’s trust on its neighbor’s performance, interbank linkages self-organize themselves into very different network architectures, ranging from random to scale-free topologies. We study which network architecture can make the financial system more resilient to random attacks and how systemic risk spreads over the network. To perturb the system, we generate a random attack via a liquidity shock. The hit bank is not automatically eliminated, but its failure is endogenously driven by its incapacity to raise liquidity in the interbank network. Our analysis shows that a random financial network can be more resilient than a scale free one in case of agents’ heterogeneity.","Simone Lenzu thanks the Department of Economics at the Universita’ Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona for kind hospitality during the initial stage of this project.

We therefore aimed to assess cardiovascular risk factor profiles of consecutive patients hospitalized with TIA/IS to stratify the risk of recurrent stroke according to the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) and of future cardiovascular events according to the ankle brachial index (ABI) as a marker of generalized atherosclerosisMethodsIn this cross-sectional observational study, 85 neurological stroke units throughout Germany documented cardiovascular risk factor profiles of 10 consecutive TIA/IS patients on standardized questionnaires. Screening for PAD was done with Doppler ultrasonography to calculate the ABI.ResultsA total of 852 patients (57% men) with a mean age of 67±12.4 years were included of whom 82.9 % had IS. The median National Institutes of Health stroke sum score was 4 (TIA: 1). Arterial hypertension was reported in 71%, diabetes mellitus in 26%, clinical PAD in 10%, and an ABI ≤ 0.9 in 51%. An ESRS ≥ 3 was observed in 58%, which in two previous retrospective analyses corresponded to a recurrent stroke risk of ≥ 4%/year.

We first study the contagion ripple-spreading process triggered by oil market. Then we select four financial institutions from banks, brokerages, insurance and other institutions as contagion source respectively to study the how contagion will spread once these financial institutions trigger financial contagion. Finally, centrality comprehensive evaluation method is applied with heterogeneous networks generated from different contagion ripple-spreading processes to study the institutions’ systemic importance. The empirical results show that the contagion triggered by oil market first spreads to other financial institutions, and then to banks, brokerages and insurance. The contagion triggered by a financial institution first spreads in financial sectors that the contagion source belongs to, and then to other sectors. Moreover, most brokerages and banks have highest systemic importance. Insurance and the rest of brokerages, banks have middle level of systemic importance.

650,pub.1032239578,10.1111/rmir.12062,,,,Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector: A Review and Directions for Future Research,"This article reviews the extant research on systemic risk in the insurance sector and outlines new areas of research in this field. We summarize and classify 48 theoretical and empirical research papers from both academia and practitioner organizations. The survey reveals that traditional insurance activity in the life, nonlife, and reinsurance sectors neither contributes to systemic risk nor increases insurers’ vulnerability to impairments of the financial system. However, nontraditional activities (e.g., credit default swap underwriting) might increase vulnerability, and life insurers might be more vulnerable than nonlife insurers due to higher leverage. Whether nontraditional activities also contribute to systemic risk is not entirely clear; however, the activities with the potential to contribute to systemic risk include underwriting financial derivatives and providing financial guarantees. This article is not only likely of interest to academics but also highly relevant for the industry, regulators, and policymakers.",,"Systemic Risk in Traditional Insurance Funding and Investing Activities Traditional funding and investing activities of insurance companies include collecting up‐front premiums for underwriting risks and asset and liability management, in addition to liquidity management. In addition, insurance‐linked securities (ILS), specifically cat bonds, are considered traditional. There is consensus in the literature that the business model based on collecting upfront premiums for bearing risks that can lead to contingent claims is very stable and ensures sufficient liquidity. Therefore, an “insurance run” is not possible in the nonlife sector, and a fire sale of assets that could have a systemic impact is unlikely. Furthermore, regulators might anticipate the risk of fire sales and automatically relax capital requirements during a crisis (indeed, precisely such a procedure is expected to be included in the forthcoming Solvency II regulation). The opposite situation, that is, long‐term liabilities and short‐term assets, increases insurers’ exposure to interest rate risk and their vulnerability. However, the Geneva Association (2010a) claims that insurance companies use “assets and derivatives to replicate insurers’ liability profiles and match their expected claims.” Cummins and Weiss (2014), who analyze the balance sheets of U.S. nonlife and life insurers, support this industry view that there should be no maturity mismatch and conclude that “asset and liability maturities are both long term for insurers.” Insurer funding and asset liability management enjoy a certain degree of stability due to the generally high equity coverage in nonlife and reinsurance, as reported by Harrington (2009) and Cummins and Weiss (2013). Regarding life insurers, however, Harrington (2013), Cummins and Weiss (2014), Grace (2011), and Baranoff et al. (2011) argue that the equity basis of life insurers is relatively low. These companies’ assets might not be sufficiently diversified (many insurers hold only government bonds), and some companies are substantially invested in mortgage‐backed securities. Furthermore, it could be argued that the business model of life insurers in general is more vulnerable to impairments of the financial system than that of nonlife insurers due to contract duration. Life insurance is a long‐tail business and involves contracts that span decades. By contrast, nonlife insurance is short‐tail, and contracts tend to be short term. Therefore, if loss frequency is low, life insurers have to invest more capital over a longer period of time and are therefore more affected by adverse capital market movements. This indication of life insurers’ vulnerability to impairments of the financial system is supported by Chen et al. (2013), who calculate the SRISK and MES systemic risk measures via a copula approach and discover that life insurers are much more affected by economic downturns than are nonlife insurers. However, a few studies express some doubt that life insurers are vulnerable to impairments of the financial system. Even if an insurance run did materialize, Baranoff et al. (2013) show that the likelihood of a fire sale is low because life insurers maintain a level of liquidity adequate to cope with stressful situations. Simulations based on historical lapse rates reveal that life insurers need not sell assets before maturity to fulfill their obligations. Even in a worst‐case scenario in which 10 times the normal number of policies are canceled, the volume of assets that need to be sold before maturity makes up only a small fraction of the bond market. Berry‐Stölzle et al. (2014) support this line of reasoning and show that during the subprime crisis, life insurers’ access to external capital was not endangered and TARP funds for life insurers were unnecessary. Using regression analyses, they show that for the period between 1999 and 2010, the reasons for issuing new capital—compensating for operational losses or funding growth opportunities—were the same during the subprime crisis as during normal times. In addition, capital issuance can be predicted by the same factors during normal times and times of crisis. No evidence of a shortage of capital for insurers during times of crisis could be found. There is one aspect of liquidity management that could increase vulnerability in an extremely adverse market environment: the fungibility of liquidity in globally operating insurance conglomerates. As Radice (2010) argues, in the event of a crisis, local regulators could prohibit the transfer of capital from local subsidiaries to a holding company outside of the local jurisdiction. This type of ring‐fencing could be attractive for regulators, if the local subsidiary holds sufficient capital to remain solvent and to ensure that local policyholders are protected. As a downside, this regulatory action would come at the expense of the holding company and other subsidiaries in other jurisdictions. In the worst case, this pattern could lead to the insolvency of the holding company or one of its other subsidiaries, even if the group as a whole continues to be solvent. Drake and Neale (2011) argue in the opposite direction and stress that the guarantees given among different judicial entities within an insurance group could lead to another AIG case: healthy subsidiaries under the oversight of insurance regulators have to pay for the poor decisions of noninsurance, nonregulated entities. Nevertheless, bear in mind that capital transfers out of insurance companies are normally restricted if the transfer endangers the financial stability or solvency of the insurer. Similar to the IAIS (2013), we regard ILS as a traditional insurance funding and investing activity, provided that the underwritten risks are (1) idiosyncratic, (2) not correlated with one another, and (3) not influenced by economic business cycles. The most common ILS are cat bonds. In essence, these products use the financial markets to further diversify the underwriting risk of events such as pandemics or hurricanes among a wider group of investors. A study by Cummins and Weiss (2009) shows that returns on cat bonds are not correlated with returns on bonds or stocks during normal times and only slightly so in times of crisis. They conclude that cat bonds are valuable for diversification even during a crisis. A recent study by Weiß et al. (2013) supports this view. The authors relate the issuing of cat bonds to systemic risk measures and find that cat bonds have no statistical impact on SRISK or ΔCoVaR. Finally, Kessler (2014), the IAIS (2011, 2012b), and Schwarcz and Schwarcz (2014) note that the volume of cat bonds is remains relatively low and thus cannot be counted as either a contribution to systemic risk or a vulnerability to impairments of the financial system. Another factor that should prevent contribution to systemic risk by insurers is the high level of market discipline in insurance and reinsurance. Harrington (2004, 2013) argues that policyholders are risk sensitive and prefer to address financially sound insurers. Furthermore, agents, brokers, and advisors, as well as rating agencies, monitor insurance companies. Therefore, insurance companies limit their risk taking and are careful to maintain a financially healthy position. Systemic Risk in Nontraditional Insurance Funding and Investing Activities We regard the securitization of embedded value securitization, securities lending, and credit rating utilization, as well as short‐term funding via issuing commercial papers, as nontraditional funding and investing activities. These activities can be undertaken by life, nonlife, and reinsurance companies. Insurance companies pay commissions to agents and brokers for new policies sold. These commission payments are typically up front because they are often paid out immediately after the sales process but involve the entire life span of the policy. Therefore, under certain circumstances, these payments are not fully expensed immediately but deferred over the duration of the policy and are recognized as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. The securitization of these intangible assets is called embedded value securitization and increases the liquidity of the insurer. According to the IAIS (2012b), this activity exposes the investor who buys these intangible assets to substantial interest rate risk via implied guarantees, insurance risks, and market risk. However, embedded value securities do not contribute to systemic risk because (1) their outstanding volume is marginal compared to other asset‐backed securities and (2) the risks seem to be similar to those of directly buying the stock of the insurance company. As noted above, it is typically not necessary for insurance companies to engage in a fire sale of assets before maturity to overcome liquidity problems. The Geneva Association (2010a) argues that there can be an exception if short‐term financing is used to fund additional investments. Two profit‐enhancing methods, if used excessively, can increase the systemic risk contribution of insurers and make them more vulnerable to impairments of the financial system: “Securities lending,” which is when long‐term investors such as insurance companies lend their long‐term securities to other market participants for short‐selling, and therefore receive a fee and collateral. For the collateral, the insurance company has to pay interest, which is normally low and generated by investing the collateral in safe and short‐term assets. In its plain vanilla form, this activity is not a problem from a systemic risk perspective. However, the vulnerability of an insurer increases if the collateral is invested instead in risky or long‐term assets to generate additional profits. The fact that the investor typically has the right to return the borrowed securities on short notice is especially problematic. It might also increase the insurance company's liquidity risk, if the collateral is invested in illiquid assets, and might lead to a situation in which a fire sale of assets becomes necessary to meet obligations. “Credit rating utilization”’ is essentially a form of increasing leverage. It involves borrowing money, provided that the credit rating is not endangered. Again, the additional capital is invested in safe and short‐term assets. If the capital is instead invested in long‐term assets, then the liquidity risk and, subsequently, the vulnerability of the insurer might increase. In times of crisis, it can be expected that the rating of an insurer is under pressure and assets have to be sold to maintain the investment grade. Acharya et al. (2011) note that securities lending per se need not be a risky activity, provided that the collateral is invested in safe assets with a shorter duration than the securities that are borrowed by other institutions. By contrast, AIG engaged in very aggressive securities lending, which was one reason that the company needed financial support. Harrington (2009) makes a similar assessment of the AIG failure, but Baranoff (2012) explains why the securities lending program on its own did not and most likely in general will not contribute to systemic risk: market practice normally requires 120 percent of the value of the security as cash collateral from the borrower. However, as the lender, AIG also ultimately had to post collateral; thus, the borrower took no risk. In the event of an AIG‐like bankruptcy, the borrower could simply sell the borrowed securities and keep the additional collateral. Generally, the right to liquidate the securities in the event of the lender's default limits the counterparty risk and strongly reduces the systemic risk contribution of this business activity. In the case of AIG, the company itself eventually chose to reduce this business activity and instead turned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for funding. Finally, the Geneva Association (2010a) illuminates another practice that can contribute to systemic risk and increases vulnerability to impairments of the financial system: relying extensively on short‐term funding via issuing commercial paper could lead to the necessity of selling assets before maturity. Bear in mind, however, that this practice is highly unusual for standard insurance companies. Effectively, this issue illustrates why one should not focus on the company level but instead on the level of business activities. There are systemic risk‐contributing practices in which insurance companies can engage, but that does not mean that a substantial part of the insurance sector is doing so. In the reinsurance sector, industry‐loss warranties (ILW) can be viewed as nontraditional insurance activities. These warranties are not linked to an individual loss event but instead cover the downturn of an entire industry. According to the IAIS (2012b) and Acharya and Richardson (2014), these products can pose increased basis and credit risk because there is no collateral requirement. With the exception of the case of cat bonds, there are not enough studies on which to base a solid assessment of alternative risk transfer products (ILS and ILW). In addition to ILW, other ILS related to life insurance could be strongly connected to interest rate and credit risk. Thus, in principle, all nontraditional funding and investing activities have the potential to increase insurer vulnerability to impairments of the financial system. Whether and, if so, to what extent these activities contribute to systemic risk is not entirely clear. According to our definition, the noninsurance activity of CDS underwriting, as noted by the IAIS (2011), belongs to the underwriting processes, whereas capital market business, banking, and third‐party asset management are funding and investing processes.",Risk Management and Insurance Review,,Wiley,"1098-1616, 1540-6296",,2016-09-23,2016,2016-09-23,2016-09,19,2,249-284,All OA; Green,Article,"Eling, Martin; Pankoke, David Antonius","Eling, Martin (); Pankoke, David Antonius ()",,"Eling, Martin (); Pankoke, David Antonius ()",,,,,,Cummins (United States),,United States,,,21,5,,8.59,,http://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/254707/1/14_21_Eling%20et%20al_Systemic%20Risk%20in%20the%20Insurance%20Sector.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032239578,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

It has created an unprecedented level of risk, causing investors to suffer significant loses in a very short period of time. This paper aims to map the general patterns of country specific risks and systemic risks in the global financial markets and financial markets. It also analyses the potential consequence of policy interventions, such as the US decision to implement a zero-percent interest rate and unlimited quantitative easing (QE), and to what extent these policies may introduce further uncertainties into global financial markets. This paper highlights the enormous economic and social impact of COVID-19 with respect to articles that have either prognosticated such a large-scale event, and its economic consequences, or have assessed the impacts of other epidemics and pandemics. A consideration of possible impacts of COVID-19 on financial markets and institutions, either directly or indirectly, is briefly outlined by drawing on a variety kinds of literatures. A consideration of the characteristics of COVID-19, along with what research suggests have been the impacts of other past events that in some ways roughly parallel COVID-19, points toward avenues of future investigation. This paper offers an informed commentary on the actual and potential impacts of the pandemic on financial markets, sector and centres, grounded in literature on financial centres, the state-finance nexus, and trends affecting the landscape of finance since the global financial crisis. We expect a slowdown in new financial regulation, continued firm-level consolidation, and a continued rise of business services related to finance. The application of new financial technologies is likely to accelerate, affecting retail banking in particular, but will not necessarily be led by FinTech firms.

Further, we use the Hiemstra and Jones (1994, hereafter HJ) and Diks and Panchenko (2005, hereafter DP) tests for comparison purposes. Our findings indicate that all countries reveal significant negative dependence in the long-run dynamics between Oil prices and Brazilian, Indian, and South African currencies. HJ and DP tests suggest that lagged crude oil prices have predictive power for the Brazilian and Russian exchange rates. Furthermore, a robust unidirectional lagged dependence exists from the Brazilian exchange rate to crude oil prices.

389,pub.1133345213,10.1111/jacf.12431,,,,"Apocalypse Averted: The COVID‐Caused Liquidity Trap, Dodd‐Frank, and the Fed","In an article published in this journal in 2012, the author challenged the conventional wisdom that a major feature of Dodd‐Frank—the mandated clearing and required margining of OTC derivatives—could be expected to achieve a material reduction of the risk of another financial crisis. In this article, the author views the dramatic financial fallout from the spread of COVID‐19 in March 2020, when the economic infrastructure of the U.S. was threatened by extreme disruptions in its stock and bond markets, as providing the first major test of this theory. The author's main conclusion from this episode is that the very mechanism that advocates of Dodd‐Frank claimed would reduce systemic risk—the clearing of and imposition of margin requirements on derivatives—played a major role in this acute market dislocation by amplifying stresses on and dramatically reducing market liquidity. One major implication of this analysis is that protecting important pieces of the system, such as clearinghouses, is not the same as protecting the entire system; indeed, these two goals are likely to prove to be antithetical under conditions of stress. It was only massive injections of liquidity by the Federal Reserve, and not the autonomous operation of the market infrastructure mandated by Dodd‐Frank, that succeeded in stemming the crisis. And as this case is meant to suggest, despite clearing mandates and other major regulatory changes designed to minimize systemic risk, the net effect has been to substitute possibly greater liquidity risks for credit risk. As a consequence, the soundness of the U.S. financial system continues to depend on the prompt and effective intervention of the Fed as lender of last resort, with all the attendant moral hazard problems.",,,Journal of Applied Corporate Finance,,Wiley,"1078-1196, 1745-6622",,2020-12-09,2020,2020-12-09,2020-12,32,4,44-48,Closed,Article,"Pirrong, Craig","Pirrong, Craig (University of Houston)",,"Pirrong, Craig (University of Houston)",University of Houston,grid.266436.3,Houston,Texas,United States,,,,,,2,2,,1.35,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133345213,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

This paper analyzes the impact of the Fed's balance sheet size on stock market performance.   Design/methodology/approach To analyze the Fed's balance sheet size's long-term stock market implications, this paper uses the asset pricing framework of market return predictability such as Ordinary least squares (OLS) and Generalized method of moments (GMM) analysis.   Findings Findings in this paper suggest that the Fed's balance sheet size, deflated by asset market wealth, presents evidence of return predictability during 1926–2015 that is robust against standard controls. These results can be explained through the redistribution of risk and the wealth channels of monetary policy transmission. The changing balance sheet size of a central bank (1) affects systemic risk, yields and expectations and (2) signals the future direction of monetary policy and thus economic outlook.   Research limitations/implications The main implication of these findings is that policymakers should avoid a severe imbalance between a central bank's balance sheet size and assets market wealth.

This paper takes the provincial local government debt risk data from 2011 to 2020 as the research sample to deeply investigate the effect and mechanism of digital finance on local government debt risk. The results show that, firstly, digital finance can effectively suppress local government debt risk, and a significant long-term suppressive effect is found by quantile model test. Secondly, in the mechanism of action test, digital finance effectively alleviates local government debt risk through the path of local government fiscal transparency, and has played a significant regulating effect. Finally, based on different regions and development levels, the effect of digital finance on local government debt risk is found to be more significant in eastern regions and regions with high urbanization levels.

(J Bank Finance 58: 471–485, 2015) to capture the time-varying asymmetric responses of the financial system to positive and negative shocks to individual institutions. Building on the extended method and considering a set of Chinese financial institutions, we assess the extent to which distress within different institutions contribute to systemic risk. To provide a formal ranking of risk contributions, we implement the significance and dominance tests with bootstrap Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics. The estimates of the extended Asymmetric CoVaR method reveal an asymmetric pattern that characterizes the tail interdependence in the Chinese financial system and this pattern changes dynamically over time. Particularly, the impact on the system of a fall in individual market value is only slightly larger than that of an increase during tranquil years. However, the entire system becomes extremely sensitive to downside losses than to upside gains during crises. The result also raises concern about privately owned banks in that they are systemically riskier than state-owned banks and other institutions. Using panel regressions, we also find firm characteristics such as institution size and volatility are important predictors of systemic risk contribution.","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71873146, 71873147, U1811462) and the Shanghai Outstanding Academic Leaders Plan.",,Risk Management,,Springer Nature,"0035-5593, 1460-3799, 1743-4637",,2020-10-20,2020,2020-10-20,2020-12,22,4,310-337,Closed,Article,"Wen, Fenghua; Weng, Kaiyan; Zhou, Wei-Xing","Wen, Fenghua (School of Business, Central South University, 410083, Changsha, Hunan, China; Supply Chain and Logistics Optimization Research Centre, Faculty of Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada); Weng, Kaiyan (School of Business, Central South University, 410083, Changsha, Hunan, China); Zhou, Wei-Xing (Department of Finance, Department of Mathematics and Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, 200237, Shanghai, China)","Zhou, Wei-Xing (East China University of Science and Technology)","Wen, Fenghua (Central South University; University of Windsor); Weng, Kaiyan (Central South University); Zhou, Wei-Xing (East China University of Science and Technology)",University of Windsor; East China University of Science and Technology; Central South University,grid.267455.7; grid.28056.39; grid.216417.7,Windsor; Shanghai; Changsha,Ontario; ; ,Canada; China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,,,12,12,,8.1,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131922329,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

This mechanism can be used to clear a network of obligations through blockchain. In particular, we investigate default contagion in a network of smart contracts cleared through blockchain. In so doing, we provide an algorithm which constructs the blockchain so as to guarantee the payments can be verified and the miners earn a fee. We, additionally, consider the special case in which the blocks have unbounded capacity to provide a simple equilibrium clearing condition for the terminal net worths; existence and uniqueness are proven for this system. Finally, we consider the optimal bidding strategies for each firm in the network so that all firms are utility maximizers with respect to their terminal wealths. We show that a pure strategy Nash equilibrium need not exist, and then look for mixed Nash equilibrium bidding strategies.

DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine patients with unilateral RVO and 71 age-matched control subjects.
METHODS: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-measured RNFL thickness parameters (average, 4 quadrant, and 12 clock-hour thicknesses) were compared between unaffected eyes of patients with unilateral RVO and single randomly selected eyes of control subjects.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optical coherence tomography-measured RNFL thickness.
RESULTS: In the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RVO, the mean intraocular pressure was 13.7±2.5 mmHg and the RNFL thickness was significantly thinner than in controls in the 10 and 11 o'clock sectors. In a subgroup analysis, which only included subjects aged more than 60 years, the global average and 7 and 11 o'clock sector thicknesses were significantly thinner than in controls. Glaucomatous visual field damage corresponding to RNFL defects was found in 15 unaffected eyes (19.0%) of subjects with RVO and 2 control subjects (2.8%) (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: In the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral RVO, RNFL thickness was decreased, especially in the inferior- and superior-temporal sectors, compared with that of control eyes. Difference between the groups also was noticeable on the visual field testing.

These patients are frequently reported to have retinal abnormalities and both diseases share some systemic risk factors. Hence, it is clinically relevant to determine whether ESRD is a predictor of retinal artery occlusion (RAO).To investigate the risk of RAO in ESRD patients.A retrospective, nationwide, matched cohort study. The study included 93,766 ESRD patients recruited between 2000 and 2009 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The same number control group included age- and sex-matched patients without ESRD selected from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, 2000. Data for each patient were collected from the index date until December 2011.The incidence and risk of RAO were compared between the 2 groups. The hazard ratio (HR) for RAO after adjustment for potential confounders was calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the cumulative RAO incidence rate.In total, 237 ESRD patients and 73 controls exhibited RAO during follow-up; thus, the RAO incidence rate in ESRD patients was 4.49 times (95% confidence interval (CI), 3.45-5.83) that in the control patients. After adjustment for potential confounders, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease, ESRD patients were 2.78 times (95% CI, 2.02-3.84) more likely to develop RAO in cohort for the total sample. Among patients with hypertension, the RAO incidence rate was significantly higher in the ESRD group, and hypertension significantly increased RAO risk even after adjustment for other confounders in the cohort.ESRD increases the risk of RAO, particularly in ESRD patients with hypertension. Therefore, clinicians should educate ESRD patients about RAO and ensure appropriate blood pressure control.","Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database were provided by the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance and Department of Health.

This article reviews the most recent developments in the Chinese NCD, including its effect on interest rate pass‐through and money creation. Empirical results show that the introduction of the NCD in 2014 influenced the relationship between the policy rate and the lending rate of Chinese commercial banks, and the interest rate pass‐through from the policy rate to the lending rate of commercial banks improved subsequently.

Its contemporary architecture mirrors the ‘ideal’ recommended by the World Bank. Yet occupational superannuation, the mandatory private pillar of Australia's retirement income system, is one to which many uncertainties and, hence, risks are attached almost by design. This article explores some of these systemic risks in light of the impact of the global financial crisis (GFC) and its aftermath and considers some of their implications. The range of risks includes inflation risk, malfeasance and incompetence in the management of superannuation funds, exchange rate risk, investment risk, longevity risk and political risk. However, this article focuses on the latter three. While Australia's federal governments have become increasingly conscious of investment risk and longevity risk, greater sensitivity to political risk and its impacts is still needed.","I would like to acknowledge the insightful and constructive comments on an earlier draft of this article provided by Brandeis University Emeritus Professor James H.

The individual systemic risk measurement has a certain scope of application and application conditions and, therefore, it is difficult for the individual indicator to reflect the systemic risk comprehensively. In this paper, the systemic risk is divided into four types: institution-specific risk, comovement and contagion, financial vulnerability, liquidity and credit. Next, the optimal combination is selected from multiple individual systemic risk indicators through dominance analysis to forecast the macroeconomic performance. The macroeconomic performance selects consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), industrial growth value (IVA), growth rate of broad money supply (M2) and gross domestic product (GDP) as proxies to compare the forecast effect of systemic risk, with the period considered spans from 2003M4 to 2022M7. The results of immediate forecasts of different macroeconomic performance proxies demonstrate the individual indicator cannot cover all the information of systemic risk, can only reflect the specific aspect of macroeconomic performance, or is only highly relevant in a given period.

These international standards remained rather ‘thin’ due to the absence of pace-setting jurisdictions and the foot-dragging of some jurisdictions; disagreements amongst regulators; and the push back from the financial industry. Furthermore, exchange and platform trading were not crucial to mitigate systemic risk. Clearing via central counterparties was crucial to mitigate systemic risk. However, other interlinked standards, notably, bank capital and margin requirements, were used to promote central clearing. Precise, stringent, and consistent international standards were not sponsored by the ‘great powers’, which adopted instead domestic regulatory reforms that had considerable extraterritoriality. Securities market regulators gathered in the IOSCO found it difficult to reconcile different views among more than one hundred member jurisdictions.

408,pub.1151575833,10.2139/ssrn.4234359,,,,Macroeconomic Dynamics of Bank Risk in India,"Oil-dependent economies face policy challenges when oil prices are not favourable, and the passthrough process often impacts the banking sector. Due to the onslaught of Covid-19 and consequent shutdown globally, the oil prices have risen dramatically and further exacerbated the problems for oil-dependent economies. The present study attempts to interlink the energy market and the banking sector and adds to the existing knowledge about bank risk. Specifically, here we examine the impact of oil prices and oil import, along with other factors, on the systemic risk of Indian banks. Using the weekly data from March 2007 to March 2019 for 34 Indian banks, the paper first estimates the banks’ systemic risk using the Delta conditional value at risk (∆CoVaR) approach proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) based on quantile regression. This measure gives the contribution of a particular bank, being in a risky state, to the loss of the entire banking system. Further, applying the panel vector autoregression and pooled mean group models, the study highlights that oil price, oil import, global economic growth, and stock market volatility are essential determinants of bank risk in India. Increasing oil prices, oil imports, and stock market volatility increase bank risk while improving global economic growth leads to a decline in bank risk. Based on these findings and suggested implications, we hope banks can play a pivotal role in mitigating the adverse impact of oil price fluctuations on industries and macroeconomic variables.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Khan, Azeem; Ahmad, Wasim","Khan, Azeem (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur); Ahmad, Wasim (Department of Economic Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur India)",,"Khan, Azeem (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur); Ahmad, Wasim (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur)",Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,grid.417965.8,Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh,India,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151575833,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This question is even more difficult to answer than the long-standing question, what are the forces that keep our world together. However, the social challenges of humanity in the 21st century ranging from the financial crises to the impacts of globalization, require us to make fast progress in our understanding of how society works, and how our future can be managed in a resilient and sustainable way. This book can present only a few very first steps towards this ambitious goal. However, based on simple models of social interactions, one can already gain some surprising insights into the social, ``macro-level'' outcomes and dynamics that is implied by individual, ``micro-level'' interactions. Depending on the nature of these interactions, they may imply the spontaneous formation of social conventions or the birth of social cooperation, but also their sudden breakdown. This can end in deadly crowd disasters or tragedies of the commons (such as financial crises or environmental destruction). Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical modeling approaches (such as representative agent models) do not provide a sufficient understanding of the self-organization in social systems resulting from individual interactions. The consideration of randomness, spatial or network interdependencies, and nonlinear feedback effects turns out to be crucial to get fundamental insights into how social patterns and dynamics emerge. Given the explanation of sometimes counter-intuitive phenomena resulting from these features and their combination, our evolutionary modeling approach appears to be powerful and insightful. The chapters of this book range from a discussion of the modeling strategy for socio-economic systems over experimental issues up the right way of doing agent-based modeling.  We furthermore discuss applications ranging from pedestrian and crowd dynamics over opinion formation, coordination, and cooperation up to conflict, and also address the response to information, issues of systemic risks in society and economics, and new approaches to manage complexity in socio-economic systems.

240,pub.1144404984,10.1108/ijoem-08-2021-1331,,,,Assessing the interconnectedness and systemic risk contagion in the Chinese banking network,"Purpose In this paper, the authors use the balance sheet data to investigate the interconnectedness and risk contagion effects in China's banking sector. They firstly study the network structure and centrality of the interbank network. Then, they investigate how and to what extent the credit shock and liquidity shock can lead to the risk propagation in the banking network.   Design/methodology/approach Referring to the theoretical framework by Haldane and May (2011), this paper uses the network topology theory to analyze the contagion mechanism of credit shock and liquidity shock. Centrality measures and log-log plot are used to evaluate the interconnectedness of China's banking network.   Findings The network topology has shown clustering effects of large banks in China's financial network. If the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is in distress, the credit shock has little impact on the Chinese banking sector. However, the liquidity shock has shown more substantial effects than that of the credit shock. The discount rate and the rollover ratio play significant roles in determining the contagion effects. If the credit shock and liquidity shock coincide, the contagion effects will be amplified.   Research limitations/implications The results of this paper reveal the network structure of China's interbank market and the resilience of banking system to the adverse shock.

We explicitly take an options market perspective and focus on market participants’ changes in beliefs and expectations. During the ban, short positions in banned stocks decreased, whereas they increased for non-banned stocks. Our results indicate that the ban increased implied jump risk levels, thereby negatively impacting the banned financial stocks. However, we also observe that after the announcement of the ban, financial contagion risk actually dropped for banned stocks. Instead of a substitution effect between regular short selling and synthetic shorting through single stock puts, we observe a migration out of single stock puts into the EuroStoxx 50 index options market. We conclude that this type of migration diversified selling pressure initially concentrated in financial stocks across a larger share of the stock market, thereby reducing systemic risks and enhancing overall financial stability.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2013,2013,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Felix, Luiz F.

Evidence from a risk-return-driven cost function,"The Great Recession focused attention on large financial institutions and systemic risk. We investigate whether large size provides any cost advantages to the economy and, if so, whether these cost advantages are due to technological scale economies or too-big-to-fail subsidies. Estimating scale economies is made more complex by risk-taking. Better diversification resulting from larger scale generates scale economies but also incentives to take more risk. When this additional risk-taking adds to cost, it can obscure the underlying scale economies and engender misleading econometric estimates of them. Using data pre- and post-crisis, we estimate scale economies using two production models. The standard model ignores endogenous risk-taking and finds little evidence of scale economies. The model accounting for managerial risk preferences and endogenous risk-taking finds large scale economies, which are not driven by too-big-to-fail considerations. We evaluate the costs and competitive implications of breaking up the largest banks into smaller banks.","We thank Marc Rodriguez and Arland Kane of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for their help with the data, Sally Burke for editorial assistance, and Christian Laux, conference participants at the International Banking, Economics, and Finance Association session at the Allied Social Sciences Association meetings in January 2011, and conference participants at the Financial Intermediation Research Society Annual Meeting in June 2011 for very helpful comments.

The hemodynamic force exerts on vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which could perceive the mechanical signals and transmit them into cell interior by multiple potential shear sensors, collectively known as mechanotransduction. However, we do not understand completely how these shear-sensitive components orchestrate physiological and atherosclerotic responses to shear stress. In this review, we provide an overview of biomechanical mechanisms underlying vascular physiology and atherosclerotic progression. Additionally, we summarize current evidences to illustrate that atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop in arterial regions experiencing disturbance in blood flow, during which endothelial dysfunction is the initial event of atherosclerosis, inflammation plays dominant roles in atherosclerotic progression, and angiogenesis emerges as compensatory explanation for atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Especially in the presence of systemic risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and hyperglycemia), the synergy between these systemic risk factors with hemodynamic factors aggravates atherosclerosis by co-stimulating some of these biomechanical events. Given the hemodynamic environment of vasculature, understanding how the rapid shear-mediated signaling, particularly in combination with systemic risk factors, contribute to atherosclerotic progression through endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and angiogenesis helps to elucidate the role for atherogenic shear stress in specifically localizing atherosclerotic lesions in arterial regions with disturbed flow.",,,Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology,,World Scientific Publishing,"0219-5194, 1793-6810",,2014-08,2014,2014-08,2014-10,14,05,1430006,Closed,Article,"ZHOU, TIAN; ZHENG, YIMING; QIU, JUHUI; HU, JIANJUN; SUN, DAMING; TANG, CHAOJUN; WANG, GUIXUE","ZHOU, TIAN (Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology (Chongqing University), Ministry of Education, Chongqing Engineering Laboratory in Vascular Implants, Bioengineering College of Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, P.

While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for transmission of infectious diseases between fire sites. In this manuscript, we review a first attempt at building an epidemiological model adapted to the interconnected fire system, with the aims of supporting prevention and mitigation efforts along with understanding potential impacts to workforce capacity. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016–2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We used this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We found vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible, suggesting the recommended interventions could successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. As the model was built in 2021 before the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants, the modeled viral parameters and isolation/quarantine policies may have less relevance to 2022, but nevertheless underscore the importance of following basic prevention and mitigation guidance. This work could set the foundation for future modeling efforts focused on mitigating spread of infectious disease at wildland fire incidents to manage both the health of fire personnel and system capacity.","This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service and was funded in part by joint venture agreement number 18-JV-11221636-099 between Colorado State University and the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station.

It is currently unclear how modeling approaches have assessed critical infrastructure resilience when facing compounding (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic co-occurring with natural hazards) or cascading (i.e., landslides following wildland fires) threats. For both, connection across multiple domains of critical infrastructure are of crucial importance and modeling risk and resilience associated with complex threats has been proposed as a way forward in assessing and managing systemic risk and resilience. A systematic review is conducted to understand how critical infrastructure resilience was assessed in network science literature published between 2010 and 2021.

all venture bank investment loans using interbank borrowed funds is considered.
In this scenario, a minimal amount of default insurance is used, such that Tier
1 and 2 capital requirements are still met. To do this, the default insurance
percentage on all investment loans is cut to 3.88%, although the minimum is
2.88%. Results: For a portfolio of 1.31X (ten year total conventional return)
or better, at interest rates of 2% or better, the venture bank survives and can
have excellent returns. For a portfolio of 1.5X (ten year total conventional
return) the bank can have extraordinary returns below 1.5% interest and survive
up to 3%. interest. However, if returns fall, or interest rates rise, then
venture banks go underwater quite rapidly. Conclusion: Using LIBOR funds limits
profitability, and damages stability of the bank, with no visible benefit to
any party, thus creating a new systemic risk to the banking system.",,,arXiv,,,,,2018-08-10,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hanley, Brian P.","Hanley, Brian P. ()",,"Hanley, Brian P.

Our model consists of three building blocks: first, the evolution of non-bank assets that provide the entrance point for shocks from the real economy into the banking sector. Second, a network model that describes the propagation of the shock. Third, regulatory capital constraints that restrict banks’ lending behaviour. Therefore, the framework combines the literature on systemic risk and the literature on the bank lending channel. The building blocks ensure that our model captures six important aspects: firstly, by measuring systemic risk as the reduction in lending capacity, it aligns the model definition of systemic risk to the definition of the European Systemic Risk Board. Secondly, it models banks’ lending behavior as a function of counterparty risk addressing the usual critique of missing microfoundations of bank behavior. Thirdly, it emphasizes that not only defaulted banks, but also distressed banks are a thread for the real economy due to reduced lending capacity. Fourthly, our model shows the procyclicality of current (static) capital requirements. Fifthly, it allows us to study the effects of micro-prudential capital requirements in a network setting.

We analyze networks for four key periods, capturing networks in financial markets before and after the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis. Increased connections during crisis periods are evident, as well as a general deepening of the global network.

Z jednej strony można twierdzić, że finansowanie rynku mieszkaniowego pozytywnie wpływa na wzrost gospodarczy, z drugiej jednak strony rosnąca rola kredytów mieszkaniowych wiąże się z zagrożeniami dla stabilności ekonomicznej (w tym stabilności monetarnej i finansowej). W referacie zwrócono uwagę na wybrane, istotne z polskiego punktu widzenia, aspekty pozostające na styku kredytów na nieruchomości i stabilności gospodarczej: ryzyko procykliczności, ryzyka związane ze sferą monetarną (wzrost cen nieruchomości, wzrost ilości pieniądza, osłabienie impulsów polityki monetarnej) oraz zagrożenia dla stabilności systemu bankowego (wzrost długoterminowego ryzyka płynności, kredytowego, modeli, operacyjnego, prawnego, niebezpieczeństwo przyjętych metod sprawozdawczości, ryzyko systemowe). English Abstract: Significant increase in the quota and the role of housing loans in the Polish banking system has had in no doubt important impact on the economy. On the one hand it can be argued that housing finance has a positive effect on economic growth, on the other hand, however, growing role of mortgage loans may result in threats to the economic stability (including monetary and financial stability). The paper highlights selected problems emerging on the overlap of housing finance and economic stability: risk of pro-cyclicality, risks relating to monetary policy (increase in real estate prices, growth in quantity of money, weakening of the monetary impulses) as well as threats to banking system stability (increase in long-term liquidity risk as well as credit, model, operational and legal risks, danger of accepted reporting approaches and systemic risk).",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kochanski, Blazej","Kochanski, Blazej (Gdańsk University of Technology - Faculty of Management and Economics)",,"Kochanski, Blazej ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102405230,,,,,,,,,dims

This is in line with the existing policy goal to expand market-based, disintermediated financing channels, which has been ongoing since the 1980s. Initial efforts to restart the moribund securitisation market in Europe have been carried out through a number of public consultations which have more recently converged towards the Commission’s proposal for a Regulation laying down the rules to create a European framework for Simple, Transparent and Standardised (STS) securitisation. This article provides a critical perspective on the EU project to create a capital market union and in particular on the proposed framework for STS securitisation. The critique is firstly centred on the problematic coordination of the different policy objectives, which emerged from the consultations’ responses. Secondly, it points to four specific areas of concern, namely, the difficulty to define securitisation for the purpose of the regulation, the dangers of linkages with the shadow banking system, the unresolved reliance on external ratings, and the question of STS supervision. It is argued in this article that the persistence of these problems in the current design leads to questioning whether a revived securitisation market would still fuel the shadow banking system and create systemic risks. It is pointed out that the difficulty to regulate complex legal relationships typical of long intermediation chains – such as tranched securitisation – makes the proposed framework still weak. This article submits that only a tighter approach to transaction standardisation could ensure the simplicity and transparency that the Commission is hoping to achieve. Equally, a supervisory infrastructure centred on the overseeing power of a pan-European authority is needed to prevent pre-crisis legal problems from recurring.",,,Accounting Economics and Law - A Convivium,,De Gruyter,"2194-6051, 2152-2820",,2016-07-20,2016,2016-07-20,,7,3,20160008,All OA; Green,Article,"Bavoso, Vincenzo","Bavoso, Vincenzo (School of Law, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK)","Bavoso, Vincenzo (University of Manchester)","Bavoso, Vincenzo (University of Manchester)",University of Manchester,grid.5379.8,Manchester,Manchester,United Kingdom,,,,,,7,0,,11.45,,https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ael-2016-0008/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027781996,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

The concept of conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR), due to Adrian and Brunnermeier (2008), was used to quantify the level of systemic risk and financial linkages among six major Thai commercial banks over the period of 1996Q2-2009Q1. Intuitively, CoVaR measures the degree of ‘risk externalities’ that a single institution imposes on the system. We found that there was additional risk imposed onto the overall system by individual banks, both during the Asian crisis time and in subsequent periods. There is some evidence that larger banks contribute more to this systemic risk, as measured by the concept of “ΔCoVaR,” but size is far from being a dominant factor. We further apply the concept of CoVaR to measure the financial linkage between any two banks and identify balance-sheet factors which determine such financial linkage via panel data regressions. These measures of risk externalities serve as a useful additional toolbox to the regulators, and themselves have novel regulatory implications.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2011,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Roengpitya, Rungporn; Rungcharoenkitkul, Phurichai","Roengpitya, Rungporn (Bank of Thailand); Rungcharoenkitkul, Phurichai (Bank for International Settlements (BIS) - Monetary and Economic Department)",,"Roengpitya, Rungporn (); Rungcharoenkitkul, Phurichai ()",,,,,,,,,,,32,10,,10.53,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102302961,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

However, there is limited investigation of the potential role social determinants of health may play in augmenting systemic risk factors of DR. This single-center retrospective study aims to identify the association between certain sociodemographic factors and systemic risk factors for developing DR and to assess the impact of these factors on the development of vision-threatening forms of DR (VT-DR).
Methods Multivariable analysis of longitudinal electronic health record data at a large academic retina clinic was performed. Sociodemographic factors included race, ethnicity, income, and insurance payor. Systemic risk factors for DR included hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c), systolic blood pressure (sBP), and body mass index (BMI). VT-DR was identified from encounter diagnostic codes indicating proliferative retinopathy or diabetic macular edema. Patient-reported primary address zip codes were used to approximate income level, stratified into quartiles.
Results From 2016 to 2018, 3,470 patients with diabetes totaled 11,437 visits were identified. Black patients had higher HgbA1c and sBP compared to White patients. White patients had higher BMI and sBP compared to patients of unknown/other race and greater odds of VT-DR than the latter. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity had significantly higher sBP than non-Hispanic patients. Low-income patients had higher BMI and sBP than high-income patients and greater odds of VT-DR than the latter. Medicaid recipients had greater odds of VT-DR than those with Blue Care Network (BCN) and Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) insurance. Medicaid and Medicare recipients had higher sBP compared to BCBS recipients. Finally, both higher HgbA1c and sBP had greater odds of VT-DR. There were no differences in odds of VT-DR between White and Black patients or between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients.
Conclusions Significant associations exist between certain sociodemographic factors and well-known risk factors for DR. Income and payor were associated with increased severity of systemic risk factors and presence of VT-DR. This warrants further investigation of how risk factor optimization and disease prevention may be further improved by targeted intervention of these modifiable sociodemographic factors.",,,Research Square,,Research Square Platform LLC,,,2022-05-04,2022,2022-05-04,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Nguyen, Chan Tran N; Yosef, Matheos; Khalatbari, Shokoufeh; Shah, Anjali R","Nguyen, Chan Tran N (Michigan State University College of Human Medicine); Yosef, Matheos (MICHR: Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research); Khalatbari, Shokoufeh (MICHR: Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research); Shah, Anjali R (University of Michigan W K Kellogg Eye Center)",,"Nguyen, Chan Tran N (Michigan State University); Yosef, Matheos (); Khalatbari, Shokoufeh (); Shah, Anjali R (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor)",Michigan State University; University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,grid.17088.36; grid.214458.e,East Lansing; Ann Arbor,Michigan; Michigan,United States; United States,,,,,,0,0,,,10.0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1611608/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147646299,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Nutrition; Patient Safety; Prevention,Eye; Metabolic and endocrine,,,,"A02 Public Health, Health Services and Primary Care",3 Good Health and Well Being,dims

These two threats are related. Deposit insurance and other bank protection creates rents outside the normal budgetary process that funds and encourages risk taking. Governments create these rents not just to reward bankers, but also to target credit subsidies to preferred groups of borrowers. In recent decades worldwide real estate lending has been increasingly favored. Tackling the twin problems of excessive protection of banks and subsidization of housing finance risk with macro-prudential regulation is difficult because the agencies charged with regulatory oversight are subject to the political influences that give rise to these two ""gorillas"" in the first place. Furthermore, the incentives of economists tend to make them accomplices in the drama that underestimates the importance of these primary threats to systemic stability.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2017,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Calomiris, Charles W.","Calomiris, Charles W.

Ensuring that the prices of assets, including residential property, reflect climate risks is essential in averting the systemic risk climate change poses to financial stability. By undertaking a case study of a major Australian bank through interviews and focus groups with twenty-six participants, we identify factors influencing climate-related decisions affecting home loans and draw together a framework of barriers and enablers building on prior literature. The framework's six categories are economic market failure, economic non-market failure, political-institutional, socio-cultural, behavioural and organisational, with more specific factors within each category. Interdependencies and relationships between factors mean they cannot be perceived or addressed in isolation. Further theorising of the stages of decision-making within the case bank reflect a need for proactive, comprehensive action embedded in core value creating processes and internal governance, that interact with and are deeply connected to the broader society and environment in which the bank operates.","This paper acknowledges the Gadigal people of the Eora nation whose lands this was written on.

Driven primarily by increased compliance requirements and the need to mitigate risks associated with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism regulations, de-risking led to the termination of correspondent banking relationships with various countries and financial institutions. The research aimed to understand the implications of this phenomenon on financial integration, access to essential financial services, and the exacerbation of economic disparities among different regions and demographic groups in Europe. A descriptive research design approach was employed, mainly quantitative analysis of CBR data and regulatory changes. The findings demonstrated that de-risking had a significant negative impact on financial inclusion and stability, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, non-profit organizations, and marginalized communities. Moreover, the termination of CBRs disrupted the flow of remittances, trade finance, and development aid, and led to an increased reliance on less-regulated, informal channels, which in turn undermined the global AML/CFT regime and exacerbated financial crime and systemic risks. Based on these findings, the study recommended enhancing collaboration and coordination among regulatory authorities, financial institutions, and affected stakeholders to develop a harmonized regulatory framework across European countries, implement a risk-based approach, and establish a centralized information-sharing platform. Additionally, targeted capacity-building efforts, exploration of innovative financial solutions, and the development of financial inclusion strategies prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable segments of the population were recommended to counteract the negative effects of de-risking and promote financial inclusion and stability in Europe.

We use Chen et al.’s model (2016) to construct the decision problem in the experiment. The model assumes that the systemic risk occurs through two channels: the liquidity channel and the network channel. The former occurs from the external investment shock which is endogenous in the balance sheet. The latter is a function of other banks’ clearing repayment; which is also caused by the external investment shock. Given these, there are two intuitive optimal strategies in order to avoid a failure: imposing a higher external investment interest than that of its risk and avoiding the financial interactions with the high-risky banks. We use students and bankers as our subjects to check the validity of Chen et al.’s optimal strategy given their respective background. Our results show that both students and bankers partially follow Chen et al.’s intuitive optimal strategy: the first strategy.

499,pub.1113945617,10.1111/1911-3846.12501,,,,Does Fair Value Accounting Contribute to Systemic Risk in the Banking Industry?,"I investigate whether fair value accounting can contribute to the banking industry's systemic risk. I focus on the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 (SFAS No. 115), which required available‐for‐sale (AFS) securities to be recognized at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in equity through accumulated other comprehensive income. SFAS No. 115 increased banks' regulatory risk because, at the time, calculation of regulatory capital closely conformed with GAAP equity. I find that systemic risk increased following the adoption of SFAS No. 115. Furthermore, following a subsequent regulatory amendment—which excluded unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities from regulatory capital but did not change their GAAP treatment—systemic risk decreased. Taken together, the evidence suggests that fair value accounting has the potential to increase systemic risk through the explicit inclusion of volatile fair value estimates in regulatory bank capital adequacy assessments. I do not, however, find evidence of fair value accounting impacting systemic risk in its information role; that is, by providing information to a bank's external stakeholders about its financial position and performance. I also show that higher fair value volatility of investment securities, lower bank capital, and larger AFS security holdings increase banks' marginal contribution to systemic risk. My findings should interest regulators and policymakers, as recent regulatory changes in light of Basel III recommendations require unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities to be included in regulatory capital for advanced approaches banks. La comptabilité à la juste valeur contribue‐t‐elle au risque systémique dans le secteur bancaire? L'auteur se demande si la comptabilité à la juste valeur peut contribuer au risque systémique dans le secteur bancaire. Il s'intéresse plus particulièrement à l'adoption de la norme SFAS n° 115 exigeant que les titres disponibles à la vente soient comptabilisés à leur juste valeur, les profits et pertes latents étant inclus dans les capitaux propres par l'intermédiaire du cumul des autres éléments du résultat global (AERG). La norme n° 115 a augmenté le risque lié à la réglementation auquel sont exposées les banques du fait qu’à l’époque, le calcul du capital réglementaire s'apparentait de près à celui des capitaux propres selon les PCGR. L'auteur constate que le risque systémique a augmenté à la suite de l'adoption de la norme SFAS n° 115. Il a par ailleurs diminué après une modification réglementaire subséquente — selon laquelle les gains et pertes latents afférents aux titres disponibles à la vente ont été exclus du capital réglementaire tout en demeurant assujettis au même traitement en vertu des PCGR. Dans leur ensemble, ces constatations semblent indiquer que la comptabilité à la juste valeur a le potentiel d'accroître le risque systémique par suite de l'intégration explicite d'estimations à la juste valeur volatiles dans les évaluations réglementaires du caractère adéquat du capital bancaire. L'auteur ne relève cependant rien qui permette d'affirmer que la comptabilité à la juste valeur ait une incidence sur le risque systémique dans son rôle informatif, soit celui de fournir aux parties prenantes externes d'une banque de l'information au sujet de la situation et de la performance financières de cette dernière. Il montre en outre qu'une plus grande volatilité de la juste valeur des titres de placement, un capital bancaire moins élevé et la détention d'un plus grand volume de titres disponibles à la vente accroissent la contribution marginale des banques au risque systémique. Les observations de l'auteur devraient intéresser les autorités de réglementation et les responsables de l’élaboration des politiques, puisque les modifications récemment apportées à la réglementation dans la foulée des recommandations de Bâle III exigent que les gains et pertes latents afférents aux titres disponibles à la vente soient inclus dans le capital réglementaire des banques utilisant les approches avancées.",,,Contemporary Accounting Research,,Wiley,"0823-9150, 1911-3846",,2019-08-21,2019,2019-08-21,2019-12,36,4,2588-2609,Closed,Article,"Khan, Urooj","Khan, Urooj (Columbia Business School)","Khan, Urooj ","Khan, Urooj ()",,,,,,,,,,,19,15,,11.09,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113945617,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability",,,,,,,,dims

We propose the collection and analysis of digital narratives (DNs) to observe and assess significant concerns about sustainability and resilience (e.g., as reflected by social movements and interests). Observing temporal changes, globally, in the frequency, sources, and content of DNs can illuminate emerging trends in perceptions, attitudes, norms, hopes or fears of individuals and groups. Of particular interest are movements towards acceptance of, or resistance to, locally adaptive pathways to sustainable futures. We propose forming a Digital Observatory of Narratives of Sustainability (DONS) as a collaborative platform with associated open-source tools for analyzing and representing the societal landscape and its dynamics, thereby providing data to help model future societal trajectories and develop approaches to cope with systemic risks. The DONS opens a rich field for inter- and trans-disciplinary research on sustainability through narratives and their dynamics in different contexts and cultures.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Risk Society and Policy Research Center (RSPRC), National Taiwan University for symposia held in 2016, 2018, and 2020.

We start by estimating a global risk factor using CDS data, and we analyze the information content in a wide set of financial indicators on the global risk factor as well as on credit risk at the level of sectors. The global risk factor is then used to evaluate the systemic and idiosyncratic components of credit risk for sectorial credit indices. A similar decomposition of credit risk is obtained for CDS issuers in the industrial and financial sectors of Europe and North America. Such decomposition can be an important tool when evaluating the diversification possibilities of credit portfolios as well as for the design of appropriate hedging strategies.

However, there is a lack of research on measuring systemic risk and identifying important banks under the same framework. And there are relatively few studies comparing different indicators of systemically important banks in the context of China's banking industry. Therefore, this paper first constructs a new Merton model to measure the dynamically evolving systemic risk of China's banking system. Then combine the Merton model with the Shapley value to construct the Merton-Shapley framework, and propose a new indicator MShv to identify systemically important banks. At last, use the data of China's banking industry from 2006 to 2019 to conduct an empirical study. The research results show that the systemic risk in China peaked in 2008 and 2015 near the stock market crash, after 2008 the risk appeared a fluctuating decline. And it is found that MShv can accurately identify important banks and simultaneously is conducive to policy implementation. By a comparison between MShv and other systemic risk contribution indicators such as ΔCoVaR, MES, and SRISK, we find that there are many differences for different indicators in the applicability of identifying systemically important banks, the information reflected, and so on. Regulators can consider using several indicators synthetically to supervise banks during different risk periods, in order to maintain the stability of the financial system.",,"Prof. Hong Fan was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71971054], Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai [19ZR1402100].",Heliyon,,Elsevier,"2405-7843, 2405-8440",,2022-12-09,2022,2022-12-09,2022-12,8,12,e12238,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fan, Hong; Zhao, Yating","Fan, Hong (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai, China); Zhao, Yating (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai, China)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University); Zhao, Yating (Donghua University)",Donghua University,grid.255169.c,Shanghai,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8870446,71971054,0,0,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12238,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153494656,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims
175,pub.1157732828,10.1515/ercl-2023-2002,,,,Foreign Currency Loans and the Foundations of European Contract Law – A Case for Financial and Contractual Crisis?,"Abstract Loans with variable interest rates indexed to foreign currencies carry a double risk for borrowers: a rise of interest rates and an adverse development in the exchange rate. While they therefore could have been forbidden for consumer credit, they are allowed both at EU and (most) national levels. Consumer credit arrangements indexed to foreign currencies that were legal in principle have raised enormous problems when they occurred in large numbers in Eastern and Central European countries and reference was not directly written into the terms (like in Romania), but could change with additional discretionary decisions (such as in Poland and Croatia). While Croatia has introduced special legislation to cure the overall problem, Polish cases are potentially not only causing a systemic risk for the whole banking system, but abundantly are the subject of CJEU case law. This triggers the core interest in contract law, namely an unheard-of relevance in EU law of general and more specific questions of the law of restitution – on the basis of unjust enrichment and/or of damages. This article presents the following five main theses. Firstly, while the Unfair Contract Terms Directive (UCTD) contains too vague a scheme of remedies/sanctions for detailed answers, the overarching benchmark is clear, namely a fair balance of interests and the meeting of justified expectations, which the parties, especially on the consumer side, could have had at the moment when the loan was issued. Secondly, general (EU) principles of unjust enrichment, as well as of damages, are recognised by the CJEU in EU law. They order the restitution of what was gained above the status quo ante, but could not have been acquired on markets even by informed and proper contracting at that time and/or the restitution of losses incurred as compared to the status quo ante. Thirdly, Articles 23 and 24 of the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) constitute a suitable model around which a set of claims in unjust enrichment can be shaped and can be applied also to old cases. Fourthly, any windfall profit of borrowers (gain beyond what could have been achieved at the moment of formation of the contract) has to be avoided in the name of fairness and justified expectations – which are recognised in CJEU case law as the two main benchmarks of the regime of sanctions of the UCTD. Finally, a fair restitution regime is reached if the borrower, who had not been properly informed (with the nullified clause), can now make an informed choice between the different offers that were offered on markets when the loan was issued. Thus, he/she could now opt for a loan in either the national currency plus applicable interbank interest rate (in the Polish case Zloty tied to WIBOR) or their foreign currency counterparts (i.e. a loan in CHF tied to LIBOR). Expropriation (of banks) of the loan capital, as well as the possibility to use that capital to generate interest have to be avoided, for penalisation is neither an aim of European contract law nor of the UCTD.",,,European Review of Contract Law,,De Gruyter,"1614-9920, 1614-9939",,2023-04-01,2023,2023-05-03,2023-04-01,19,1,1-36,Closed,Article,"Grundmann, Stefan; Badenhoop, Nikolai","Grundmann, Stefan (Humboldt-Universität, Berlin, Germany; European University Institute (EUI), Florence, Italy); Badenhoop, Nikolai (European University Institute (EUI), Florence, Italy; Leibniz Institute for Financial Research (SAFE), Frankfurt, Germany)","Grundmann, Stefan (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; European University Institute)","Grundmann, Stefan (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; European University Institute); Badenhoop, Nikolai (European University Institute; Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE)",European University Institute; Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE,grid.15711.33; grid.7468.d; grid.509460.e,Florence; Berlin; Frankfurt am Main,; ; ,Italy; Germany; Germany,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157732828,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law; 4806 Private Law and Civil Obligations,,,,,,C18 Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims

This paper goes through the main characteristics of the State aid policy towards financial institutions applied by the Commission during the crisis, assessing it effectiveness to fight the pernicious effects of the crisis while maintaining the level playing field in the financial markets.

By analyzing the trends and fluctuations of daily stock return correlations and default correlations among the 22 largest bank holding companies and investment banks from 1988 to 2008, we find that daily stock return correlation is a simple, robust, forward-looking, and timely systemic risk indicator. There is an increasing trend in stock return correlation among banks, whereas there is no obvious correlation trend among non-banks. We also disaggregate the stock returns into systematic and idiosyncratic components and find that the correlation increases are largely driven by the increases in correlations between banks’ idiosyncratic risks, which give rise to increasing systemic risk. Correlation spikes tend to predict or coincide with significant economic or market events, especially during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, we show that stock return correlations offer a perspective on the level of systemic risk in the financial sector that is not already captured by default correlations. Stock return correlations are not subject to data limitations or model specification errors that other potential systemic risk measures may face. Therefore, we recommend that regulators and businesses monitor daily stock return correlations among those large and highly leveraged financial institutions to track the level of systemic risk.",This work was initiated while Xian Sun was working at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

An additional statutory objective (Section 3A) to maintain financial stability in the financial system was added by virtue of the Financial Services Act 2010 (Section 1(3)). One of the most novel and innovative parts of the new legislation is the market abuse regime contained in Part VIII of the FSMA 2000, and amended by the Market Abuse Directive. The broad aim of which is to ensure the integrity and probity of the financial markets while at the same time protecting consumers of financial products, lacking in previous regimes. As such the Market Abuse provisions within the FSMA, enforced by the FSA, arguably support at least two of the objectives, market confidence and systemic risk, and protecting the consumer, while also further supporting the financial crime objective. The market abuse regime was enacted to run parallel to the criminal provisions of insider dealing included in Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, and to complement the market manipulation provisions of the FSMA (Section 397), which replaced the older provisions of the Financial Services Act 1986. The global financial crisis that emerged through 2007 and into 2008 has precipitated major reforms of the regulatory structure with the FSA replaced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the replacement of the original statutory objectives, with the financial crime objective replaced by an integrity objective. The core of the market abuse regime forms part of the risk-based approach common in much of the FSA’s and now the FCA’s approach to financial services regulation. The regime guards against the risk that misuse of information by market participants will lead to a lack of integrity in the UK’s financial markets and thus dissuade users from engaging with such an important component of the UK economy. This chapter will assess how the market abuse regime of the FSMA attempts to deal with the risk posed to financial markets by the misuse of information by market participants. The chapter will analyse the risks posed by the misuse of information, with some focus on insider dealing under both the civil and criminal provisions. The purpose is to assess whether the regime in its amended form is capable of ensuring that the UK financial markets are free from abusive practices and continue to operate in a fair and open manner.","This chapter was previously published: Baker, A.H.

Cost of investments are therefore quite huge for market participants, and thus require prudent investment decisions. This paper therefore employs the recently proposed state of the art network modelling techniques known as the Bayesian graphical vector autoregressive (BG–VAR) model to examine the complex network dynamics in zonal power market movements. In addition, it accommodates the statistical and computational challenges associated with inference of interdependence (or temporal dependence) from observed multivariate time series. Our findings show the relevance of this methodology in studying interconnectedness, extracting useful hidden spatial information. In particular, various network measures have been explored in view of systemic risk spread, which therefore provide a benchmark for proper energy risk management as well as ensuring energy supply reliability and security.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fianu, Emmanuel Senyo; Ahelegbey, Daniel Felix; Grossi, Luigi","Fianu, Emmanuel Senyo (Leuphana University of Lueneburg); Ahelegbey, Daniel Felix (Boston University - Department of Mathematics and Statistics); Grossi, Luigi (University of Verona - Department of Economics)",,"Fianu, Emmanuel Senyo (); Ahelegbey, Daniel Felix (Boston University); Grossi, Luigi (University of Verona)",University of Verona; Boston University,grid.5611.3; grid.189504.1,Verona; Boston,Veneto; Massachusetts,Italy; United States,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102465228,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,7 Affordable and Clean Energy,dims
213,pub.1102270937,10.2139/ssrn.1456862,,,,Climate Change and Insurance: Integrative Principles and Regulatory Risks,"In medicine, an iatrogenic risk is a risk that arises from the medical treatment itself, such as side effects of surgery or drugs. The same phenomenon arises in the process of regulatory and legislative actions intended to facilitate mitigating and financing of catastrophic risks. Unanticipated regulatory or legislative fiats can have fundamental effects on insured risks. Moreover, economic disruptions in the much more densely interdependent global economy can also have systemic effects well beyond their direct locus of impact. These systemic risks are likely to become more evident in the catastrophe risk area in the years ahead, as the effects of climate change become more apparent. One can expect as a result increasing demands on regulators and parliamentarians who, in turn, are likely to look to the insurance and reinsurance industries for solutions. This paper describes the challenges likely to arise in this process, with a particular focus on catastrophe risks that may result from climate change (of course, weather-related events will continue to occur whether or not discernible climate change the culprit). These challenges include the magnitude of the hazards themselves, the complex interactions of mitigation with the Kyoto-driven carbon economy and the uncertainties associated with climate change itself. I review some principles that derive from the economics of insurance regulation and from the decision sciences. Some of these have been recently put forward as policy recommendations at the World Economic Forum and in the OECD Advisory Board on Financial Management of Large-scale Disasters. These recommendations on the role of insurance in mitigation and financing of catastrophe risks must be seen as part of a larger international debate on these issues. They are set against the background of increasing losses from catastrophes due to increased assets and population in vulnerable areas, the increased scale of weather-related events, possibly related to climate change, and increased interdependencies in the global economy. Given the magnitude of these risks, there is growing recognition on the importance of greater collaboration between the public and private sectors in identifying and quantifying risks from large-scale catastrophes and in the design of mitigation and residual risk financing mechanisms to cope with them. I argue here that it is essential that the insurance industry take a leadership role in developing principles and actions to address these risks.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2009,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kleindorfer, Paul R.","Kleindorfer, Paul R.

The ESS-indicator is the product of the probability of a systemic default event and the expected tail loss in case this systemic event occurs. We compute the indicator using a credit portfolio model simulation whose input parameters we estimate from market CDS spreads and equity return correlations. Also, a methodology for computing the relative contributions of individual institutions to the systemic risk indicator is provided. By applying our methodology to a sample of 38 banking groups from the European Union and Switzerland in the period between October 2005 and September 2010, we obtain the evolution of systemic risk in the European financial sector. The systemic risk reaches a peak in September 2008 and remains elevated at the end of the observation period due to the Euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis. We also compute the relative systemic risk contributions of individual banks and find that these are mainly determined by the bank size. Depending on the definition applied, we conclude that 9 to 17 European banks may be considered to be systemically important. We contribute to the ongoing discourse regarding the regulation of systemically important banking groups by suggesting the use of the relative contributions to the ESS-indicator in order to assess the systemic importance of banks.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2011,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Lahmann, Wolfgang; Kaserer, Christoph","Lahmann, Wolfgang (Technische Universität München (TUM)); Kaserer, Christoph (Technische Universität München (TUM))",,"Lahmann, Wolfgang (Technical University of Munich); Kaserer, Christoph (Technical University of Munich)",Technical University of Munich,grid.6936.a,Munich,,Germany,,,,,,1,0,,0.33,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102308245,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Global climate change, acting in negative synergy with other anthropogenic stresses, is expected to rapidly increase ongoing losses of biodiversity and profoundly redistribute enduring species. This chapter provides an overview of microbial symbiosis in a rapidly changing world. The ability of many multicellular organisms to relocate, acclimate, or adapt to these changes will depend on their microbial symbionts. But for other groups, specialized symbionts may expose acute vulnerabilities that limit climate resilience unless compensating mechanisms are engaged. We review a number of globally relevant symbioses to examine responses to elevated temperature, drought, ocean acidification, and other climate-driven challenges. While several widespread interactions, including mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants, show the clear potential to mitigate specific threats, others, such as photosymbiotic corals and the obligate nutritional symbioses of arthropods are likely to be among the first mass casualties of climate change.",We thank Chris Hurst for the opportunity to contribute to this volume.

Evidence from Chinese firms,"In response to the global climate change, the actions of Chinese government to cut down carbon emissions have brought great risks and opportunities to firms. Considering that the production process with energy consumption is inevitably accompanied by carbon emissions, this paper uses SBM-DEA model with undesirable output to evaluate firms' carbon efficiency from production perspective. Then we use the fixed-effect panel data model to study the relationship between carbon efficiency and financial performance of Chinese firms. Furthermore, we analyze whether the resource efficiency has a moderation effect on the relationship between carbon efficiency and financial performance. The results show that the carbon efficiency has a significantly positive effect on the total asset turnover (short-term operating capacity) and Tobin's Q (long-term market value) of Chinese firms, while impacts the total risk (the combination of systemic and non-systemic risks) negatively and significantly, especially for firms in carbon-intensive industries. With the improvement of resource efficiency, the impact of carbon efficiency on financial performance begins to weaken. The carbon efficiency and financial performance have monotonic effect, while resource efficiency and carbon efficiency have interactive effect. Overall, we prove that high carbon efficiency can improve the financial performance, as well as reduce the risks of firms. Based on the results, we make some suggestions for firms to improve both the carbon efficiency and the financial performance.",,,Energy Economics,,Elsevier,"0140-9883, 1873-6181",,2021-12,2021,,2021-12,104,,105658,Closed,Article,"Wang, Juan; Li, Jing; Zhang, Qingjun","Wang, Juan (College of Finance, Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, Tianjin 300222, China; Laboratory for Fintech and Risk Management, Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, Tianjin 300222, China); Li, Jing (College of Finance, Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, Tianjin 300222, China); Zhang, Qingjun (College of Finance, Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, Tianjin 300222, China)","Zhang, Qingjun (Tianjin University of Finance and Economics)","Wang, Juan (Tianjin University of Finance and Economics; Tianjin University of Finance and Economics); Li, Jing (Tianjin University of Finance and Economics); Zhang, Qingjun (Tianjin University of Finance and Economics)",Tianjin University of Finance and Economics,grid.464479.c,Tianjin,,China,,,,,,13,13,,13.39,2.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142240283,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy,dims

Firstly, we compute two systemic risk indicators, MES and volatility, with data of Chinese financial institutions. And then we explore the amplification effect of these indicators on future inflation risk, under the framework of quantile regression. We find that systematic risk indicators have a strong predictive ability for the inflation level at various quantiles. MES indicator that reflects individual risk can better predict future deflation risk, while volatility index has a stronger ability to predict inflation risk. We also find that systemic risk indicators of different dimensions have different effects on inflation risk and deflation risk. In general, the MES index, which captures the individual risk of the organization, have a greater impact on the future inflation risk.

Periodontal diseases are of concern for this population since tooth loss from these widespread problems increases with age. In general, this loss occurs because of increased exposure time to pathogenic bacteria, not some change inherent in the body brought on by the aging process. The profession has begun to place more emphasis on systemic risk factors and their role in modifying periodontal inflammation. The current thinking is that bacteria are necessary to initiate and sustain periodontal diseases, but the clinical manifestation is dictated to a significant extent by systemic factors. Smoking, diabetes, and being positive for the interleukin-1 genotype predispose the patient to developing more severe disease.

Many important financial instruments are traded in large networked markets, whose fragility played a role in the Great Financial Crisis. In “Exit Spirals in Coupled Networked Markets,” Aymanns, Georg, and Golub study strategic market participation to show that fragility is exacerbated when several networked markets are coupled, so that activity in one market facilitates participation in others. Such coupling occurs, for example, when participants use relationships in one market to borrow funds to trade in others. The authors ask when market participation is prone to sudden collapse in an exit spiral. They explain when such exit spirals emerge and find that market coupling is a pervasive cause of fragility, creating exit spirals even between networks that are individually robust. The fragility of coupled markets can be mitigated if one of two coupled markets becomes centralized or if links become more correlated across markets.
Strategic agents choose whether to be active in networked markets. The value of being active depends on the activity choices of specific counterparties. Several markets are coupled when agents’ participation decisions are complements across markets. We model the problem of an analyst assessing the robustness of coupled networked markets during a crisis—an exogenous negative payoff shock—based only on partial information about the network structure. We give conditions under which exit spirals emerge—abrupt collapses of activity following shocks. Market coupling is a pervasive cause of fragility, creating exit spirals even between networks that are individually robust. The robustness of a coupled network system can be improved if one of two markets is replaced by a centralized one or if links become more correlated across markets. History: C.

Semiconductor companies increase their intrinsic value through financing, industry mergers and acquisitions, and venture capital searches. At the same time, market investors pay more attention to the intrinsic value of companies when looking for good investment targets. Therefore, the systematic risk assessment of the global semiconductor market has become a common concern of market investors and corporate management. In this context, this paper found a method that can assess the systemic risk of the semiconductor global market, which is to use the K-means algorithm based on deep feature fusion. This paper analyzed the algorithm in depth, analyzed the quantum space of tensors, and used the definition of cluster fusion to obtain the relationship between the projection matrices U and V. Experiments were carried out on the improved algorithm, and market research was conducted on a multinational semiconductor company A, which mainly included the basic statistics of the rate of return and the ACF and PACF coefficients of the rate of return series. Finally, the stock risk comparison of company A and company B in the same period was carried out.

This problem arises for example in the analysis of systemic risk of partially observed financial networks. Typically a wide range of networks is consistent with this partial information. We develop an empirical Bayesian methodology that can be adjusted such that the resulting networks are consistent with the observations and satisfy certain desired global topological properties such as a given mean density, extending the approach by Gandy and Veraart (2017). Furthermore we propose a new fitness based model within this framework. We provide a case study based on a data set consisting of 89 fully observed financial networks of credit default swap exposures. We reconstruct those networks based on only partial information using the newly proposed as well as existing methods. To assess the quality of the reconstruction, we use a wide range of criteria, including measures on how well the degree distribution can be captured and higher order measures on systemic risk.

This paper proposes a dynamic complex interbank network system model with shadow banking in which the dynamic complex interbank network system differs from the traditional banking network and is formed by the interrelated business between shadow banks and commercial banks to explore the effect of shadow banking on the systemic risk. The results show that the existence of shadow banking will increase the systemic risk, accelerate the speed of bankruptcy of banks, reduce the survival ratio of banks, and increase the strength of central bank assistance. The smaller the number of shadow banks in the system, the higher the degree of credit connection among commercial banks and the smaller the systemic risk.","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71971054), the Shanghai Natural Science Foundation (19ZR1402100), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (19D110803).",,Complexity,,Hindawi,"1076-2787, 1099-0526",,2020-05-18,2020,,2020-05-18,2020,,1-10,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fan, Hong; Pan, Hongjie","Fan, Hong (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai 200051, China); Pan, Hongjie (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai 200051, China)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University); Pan, Hongjie (Donghua University)",Donghua University,grid.255169.c,Shanghai,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8870446,71971054,2,2,,,13.0,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/3951892.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127699143,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The crisis revealed the financial supervisory authorities’ failure, in the run-up to the crisis, to anticipate adverse macroprudential developments and prevent the accumulation of excessive risks within the financial system. This triggered a heightened awareness among regulatory and supervisory authorities regarding stability at a systemic level and macroprudential developments. The creation of the ESRB resonates with other initiatives in the aftermath of the crisis, among them the establishment of the Financial Stability Board (based with Bank for International Settlements in Basel) and, more recently, the conferral of macroprudential powers to the European Central Bank under the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The ESRB is part of the European System of Financial Supervision, the purpose of which is to ensure supervision of the European Union’s financial system. This article begins with a description of the institutional aspects of the ESRB, building on a study of its founding documents and regulation. Special attention is given to the ESRB’s mission and objectives, which are defined as contributing to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks to financial stability within the European Union. An in-depth analysis of the concepts of systemic risk and financial stability is conducted, because these concepts are crucial for determining the reach of the ESRB’s authority and responsibility. In view of the magnitude of the tasks assigned to the ESRB, this chapter considers whether the ESRB in its existing form is well suited for the large and complex undertaking it is expected to perform. This question is addressed with a critical analysis of the ESRB’s applicable measures as well as its governance structure and decision-making processes. There is reason to believe that organisational improvements will be necessary to obtain the envisaged effectiveness. The chapter concludes with some remarks about the legitimacy and accountability of the ESRB.",I am grateful to Professors Gudula Deipenbrock and Mads Andenas for comments on earlier drafts.

The first edition of this chapter, which appeared in the Oxford Handbook of Banking, first edition, was based on data in 2007, documented a notable degree of complexity among most G-SIBs, and warned complexity could pose insuperable obstacles if an institution needed to be resolved, an issue then largely neglected. The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy highlighted these issues, stimulating ambitious initiatives to rationalize the corporate structure of G-SIBs and enhance their resolvability. The second edition, based on data through May 2013, found only mixed evidence of progress in reducing corporate complexity, and noted that some institutions had grown still larger and more complex. In the current edition, published a decade after the crisis, our measures of corporate complexity remain high. Apart from some improvements in the US disclosures, the corporate structures of G-SIBs remain quite opaque. If regulators are to achieve their goal of bolstering confidence in resolution procedures and enhancing market discipline, transparency must be enhanced.",,,,The Oxford Handbook of Banking,Oxford University Press (OUP),,,2019-10-31,2019,2019-11-06,2019-10-31,,,95-130,Closed,Chapter,"Carmassi, Jacopo; Herring, Richard J.","Carmassi, Jacopo (); Herring, Richard J.

By assigning some level of distress to a bank and letting the distress propagate to the firms and banks according to relative node exposures to the distressed node, we find final states of the distress distribution. We then define DebtRank as the asset-weighted average of distress distribution and identify the level of threat that the bank poses to the entire system.","Part of this work is the result of collaboration with Yoshi Fujiwara and Stefano Battison, whom the author would like to thank.

Bailed-In.,"In this publication we are interested in the systematic risk affecting certain categories of entities in the financial sector defined as G-SII and O-SII; in the macro-prudential supervision is imposed capital reserves for systemic risk, reserves for the preservation of capital and countercyclical capital reserves to counter the pro-cyclical dynamics resulting from economic crises. In this study we were interested in the legislative aspects related to the systemic risks sanctioned by the European Commission with the CRD IV directive (2013/36/EU) and to the recommendations of the European systemic risk committee, CERS. After taking a look at the situation of Italian banks with reference to the effects of the 2008 economic crisis, we took an interest in the single SSM supervisory mechanism established by regulation (EU) no. 1024/2013, which subjects the banks of the participating Member States to central supervision of the ECB or to supervision by the competent national authorities within the SSM, a dynamic that has created inconsistencies between EU supervision and national treatment in resolution procedures sanctioned by the provisions of Directive 2014/59/EU, inconsistencies restored by the introduction of the SRM single resolution mechanism. In the framework of the legislative interventions aimed at the resolution of those in crisis, a legislative proposal is issued for the regulation (EU) 586/2015 which modifies the regulation (EU) n. 806/2014 in order to establish a European deposit insurance system, providing for the establishment of a European deposit insurance system (EDIS) as the third pillar of the banking union to guarantee depositors and aimed at reducing the negative effects of a economic crisis caused by the rush to bank branches. This is a complete EUlevel insurance system for SGDs (depositor guarantee schemes). In the last chapter we carried out a study on the BRDD directive (2014/59/EU) which establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms, with an overriding interest in collective investment activities (collective investment funds in securities securities, UCITS in contractual form) and liabilities for which the authorities they have a ban to exercise the power of reduction and conversion in application of the Bail-in, a resolution tool contained in the BRDD directive, with particular attention to existing national legislative differences on protection of funds between a bank and an investment firm.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gnazzo, Vito","Gnazzo, Vito (ISSN 2532-5612; HTNET edition)",,"Gnazzo, Vito ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128975227,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 48 Law and Legal Studies",,,,,,C18 Law,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

First, we introduce the student's t distribution into the standard DCC-MIDAS and propose a DCC-MIDAS-t model, particularly suitable for processing fat-tailed financial returns. We then apply the proposed DCC-MIDAS-t model to measure systemic risk following the idea of CoVaR. The empirical studies on the Chinese banking industry show that the DCC-MIDAS-t model is preferred in terms of the accuracy of volatility prediction and CoVaR measure. Macroeconomic information are proved to be able to improve the accuracy of systemic risk measure and M2 is most useful in comparing with IP and PPI. Several banks, such as BOC and BONB, suffered a lot from the stock market crash in June 2015 and some of them still maintain high risk spillovers during the after-crash period. Our findings suggest that these banks should be the focus of supervision even after the crash.","The authors are gratefull to the Editor-in-Chief and the anonymous referees for their helpfull comments and constructive guidance.

The first is the unregulated case, which only imposes limits on maximum leverage. The second is Basle II and the third is a hypothetical alternative in which banks perfectly hedge all of their leverage-induced risk with options. When compared to the unregulated case both Basle II and the perfect hedge policy reduce the risk of default when leverage is low but increase it when leverage is high. This is because both regulation policies increase the amount of synchronized buying and selling needed to achieve deleveraging, which can destabilize the market. None of these policies are optimal for everyone: risk neutral investors prefer the unregulated case with low maximum leverage, banks prefer the perfect hedge policy, and fund managers prefer the unregulated case with high maximum leverage.

The Jungle model is able to model credit contagion, produce doubly-peaked probability distributions for the total default loss and endogenously generate quasi phase transitions, potentially leading to systemic credit events which happen unexpectedly and without an underlying single cause. We show the Jungle model provides the optimal probability distribution for credit losses, under some reasonable empirical constraints. The Dandelion model, a particular case of the Jungle model, is presented, motivated and exactly solved. The Dandelion model provides an explicit example of doubly-peaked probability distribution for the credit losses. The Diamond model, another instance of the Jungle model, experiences the so called quasi phase transitions; in particular, both the U.S. subprime and the European sovereign crises are shown to be potential examples of quasi phase transitions. We suggest how the Jungle model is able to explain a series of empirical stylized facts in credit portfolios, hard to reconcile by some standard credit portfolio models.

In a two time period graphical model, we show that the equilibrium wealth distribution is the unique fixed point of a complex, high dimensional distribution-valued map. Fortunately, there is a dimension collapse in the limit as the network size increases, where the equilibriated system converges to the unique fixed point involving a simple, one dimensional distribution-valued operator, which, we show, is amenable to simulation. Specifically, we develop a Monte-Carlo algorithm that computes the fixed point of a general distribution-valued map and derive sample complexity guarantees for it. We numerically show that this limiting one-dimensional regime can be used to obtain useful structural insights and approximations for networks with as low as a few hundred banks.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Deo, Anand; Juneja, Sandeep","Deo, Anand (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)); Juneja, Sandeep (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR))",,"Deo, Anand (); Juneja, Sandeep ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1118075797,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 49 Mathematical Sciences",,,,,,C16 Economics and Econometrics,,dims

The result: a new focus on how macroprudential policy can reduce systemic risk. In this report we explore the emerging macroprudential policy discussion and the implications for broader monetary policy. Prior to the crisis, financial “fault lines” worsened to extremes amid the complacency of financial institutions and regulators, who were overconfident in their ability to manage risk without regard for broader systemic impact. With hindsight, it is evident that seemingly unrelated risks were in fact intertwined and cumulatively posed serious threats to the global financial system. The crisis highlighted the need for macroprudential supervision, which takes a wider, systemic view. Such oversight is concerned with the stability of entire industries and the health of linkages within the financial sector that can shatter, or strengthen, the economy. It is emerging as a crucial tool to address a glaring policy gap.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Lopez, Claude; Markwardt, Donald; Savard, Keith","Lopez, Claude (Milken Institute); Markwardt, Donald (Milken Institute); Savard, Keith (Milken Institute)",,"Lopez, Claude (Milken Institute); Markwardt, Donald (Milken Institute); Savard, Keith (Milken Institute)",Milken Institute,grid.475427.7,Santa Monica,California,United States,,,,,,2,0,,0.84,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/64499/1/MPRA_paper_64499.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102441397,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

DeFi services replicate traditional financial services such as lending, exchange, and asset management, but they are currently unregulated, unlike their traditional counterparts. We investigate Compound – one of the earliest and largest DeFi lending protocol – to show how it works, who the users are and the potential motivations behind their uses. We find that the loan durations are short (31 days on average), borrowing rates volatile and borrowers are concerned about liquidation risk. Further analyses reveal that some loan demand may arise from leveraged investment strategies. Taken together with the tacit leverage in DeFi yield farming, further availability of on-chain lending could potentially transpire into DeFi systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Saengchote, Kanis","Saengchote, Kanis (Department of Banking and Finance, Chulalongkorn Business School)",,"Saengchote, Kanis ()",,,,,,,,,,,4,4,,4.24,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05734,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141265833,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The moderator variables considered for the study include bank size, non-performing assets, leverage, deposits, loans & advances, and investments. A fixed-effects panel regression model was applied, with bank fixed effects and year fixed effects.The study contributes to the literature by proposing the concept of minimum level of capital adequacy for neutral systemic risk, which is the level of capital adequacy for which the systemic risk is non-positive. The results of the study indicate that bank size, non-performing assets, leverage, and loans & advances have a significant impact on the minimum capital adequacy for neutral systemic risk. Further, the results of the study suggest that the role of capital adequacy in systemic impact was different for public sector and private sector banks. The study suggests that, instead of setting a fixed capital adequacy level for all banks, the model can be used to set capital adequacy targets for individual banks with estimates or projections of the bank’s characteristics. This can be used in conjunction with the Basel III framework in order to rationalise capital adequacy targets.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2017,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dash, Mihir","Dash, Mihir (Alliance University - School of Business)",,"Dash, Mihir ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127172829,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Bone graft is used in cervical spine surgery to achieve several goals: to enhance bone healing reducing the risk of nonunion [6], to reconstruct bony defects, to restore the load-bearing capacity of the cervical spine, and, when adequately shaped, to restore the physiological lordosis of the cervical spine [7, 8].Integration of the graft depends on multiple factors. The presence of any detrimental condition may diminish the osteogenic potential of the fusion site, and contribute to the development of a nonunion. Numerous systemic risk factors may inhibit bone formation, including use of tobacco or other drugs, advanced age of the patient, and metabolic comorbidities (i.e., diabetes or osteoporosis) [9] (see Chap. 1). Structural instability, improper preparation of the host bone, and poor vascularity are other factors that may contribute to unsuccessful arthrodesis of the spine [5].",,,,Pitfalls in Cervical Spine Surgery,Springer Nature,,,2010,2010,,2010,,,239-281,Closed,Chapter,"Longo, Umile Giuseppe; Denaro, Luca; Maffulli, Nicola; Denaro, Vincenzo","Longo, Umile Giuseppe (Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Mile End Hospital, 275 Bancroft Road, E1 4DG, London, England); Denaro, Luca (Department of Neuroscience, University of Padua, Via Giustiniani 5, 35128, Padua, Italy); Maffulli, Nicola (Department of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, Campus Bio-Medico University, Via Alvaro del Portillo 200, 00128, Rome, Italy); Denaro, Vincenzo (Centre for Sports and Exercise Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Mile End Hospital, 275 Bancroft Road, E1 4DG, London, England)","Longo, Umile Giuseppe (Queen Mary University of London)","Longo, Umile Giuseppe (Queen Mary University of London); Denaro, Luca (University of Padua); Maffulli, Nicola (Università Campus Bio-Medico); Denaro, Vincenzo (Queen Mary University of London)",University of Padua; Queen Mary University of London; Università Campus Bio-Medico,grid.5608.b; grid.4868.2; grid.9657.d,Padova; London; Rome,Veneto; ; ,Italy; United Kingdom; Italy,,,,,,3,0,,0.57,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043286945,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,Osteoporosis; Transplantation,Musculoskeletal,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",3 Good Health and Well Being,dims

This study investigates the effect of CPH diets in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice. Apoe-/- mice were divided into three groups of 12 animals and fed high-fat diets with casein (control), Alcalase CPH, or Corolase PP CPH. After 12 weeks, mice were sacrificed, blood samples were collected, and aorta was dissected for subsequent én face analysis. Mice fed Corolase PP CPH but not Alcalase CPH had significantly lower % atherosclerotic plaque area in the aortic arch compared to controls (p = .015 and p = .077, respectively). Plasma and liver cholesterol and triacylglycerol remained constant, but levels of the fatty acid C20:5n-3 were increased, accompanied by an elevated delta-5 desaturase index in both CPHs groups. Moreover, a significant reduction of plasma MCP-1 was detected in Corolase PP CPH compared to control. Overall, our data show that protein hydrolysates from chicken reduced atherosclerosis and attenuated systemic risk factors related to atherosclerotic disorders, not related to changes in the level of plasma cholesterol.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Kari Helland Mortensen and the staff at the UiB animal facility for animal assistance and care and Kari Williams, Randi Sandvik, Svein Krüger, and Liv Kristine Øysæd for technical expertise.

These new measures are derived from optimality conditions common to a wide variety of theoretical models of banks operating under uncertainty and choosing their risk profile. We estimate loan and deposit market power rents using two large European panel datasets of bank consolidated and unconsolidated accounts. Three main results obtain. First, bank loan and deposit rents are significant and highly positively correlated both at a consolidated and unconsolidated level. Second, larger bank loan and deposit rents predict higher probabilities of bank failures and lower bank capitalization. Third, the quest for market power rents is an important driver for bank consolidation. These results are consistent with the absence of a trade-off between competition and stability, as well as with market power rents being an important driver of bank consolidation and increased systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2009,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"De Nicolo, Gianni; Turk-Ariss, Rima","De Nicolo, Gianni (Johns Hopkins University - Carey Business School; CESifo (Center for Economic Studies and Ifo Institute)); Turk-Ariss, Rima (International Monetary Fund; Economic Research Forum)",,"De Nicolo, Gianni (); Turk-Ariss, Rima ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,0.29,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102277599,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The chapter starts by discussing the corporate structure of financial conglomerates and then presenting the driving forces behind the evolution of these heterogeneous institutions. Then it moves on to review the theoretical arguments behind the creation of these universal banks and supports the discussion by presenting the empirical findings on the effects of product diversification in the banking sector. Finally, the discussion delves into the evolution of bank diversification into non-banking activities, while offering key statistics and a summary of key regulatory reforms.

Further evidence from portfolio simulations,"Does Islamic finance constitute a promising solution for the current global financial crisis and are Islamic financial innovations enough to reassure investors, stabilize financial systems and provide them with a means of escaping from financial downturns? This article addresses these questions while investigating the dynamics of Islamic and conventional stock prices over the last few years. In particular, we apply Multivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR) tools to test the interaction between conventional and Islamic financial products, and implement the Granger causality test to specify the dependence orientation of feedback between Islamic and conventional stock prices. Our article differs from previous work on the topic in that it develops portfolio simulations to determine whether Islamic finance can supplant conventional finance by generating investment and diversification opportunities during periods of crisis. In addition, we develop optimal portfolio strategies and investment proportions for conventional and Islamic funds to ensure the best resource allocation. Our main findings are: (i) the impact of the current crisis on the Islamic finance industry is less marked than on conventional finance, (ii) investment in Islamic products generates high returns, (iii) portfolios that include Islamic products reduce systemic risk and generate significant diversification benefits, (iv) the US crisis has led to significant changes in resource allocation through changes in investment choices.",,,Applied Economics,,Taylor & Francis,"0003-6846, 1466-4283",,2013-08-01,2013,2013-08-01,2013-08,45,24,3412-3420,Closed,Article,"Arouri, M.

Basel to Consider Other Risk Metrics': ""A review of trading book capital rules, due to be launched in March by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, will consider ditching value-at-risk as the main measure on which market risk capital is calculated, sources say - but it may not be easy to find a replacement."" Subsequently, in May 2012, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published Basel Committee's 'Fundamental review of the trading book - consultative document' proposing the switch from Value-at-Risk (VaR) to Expected Shortfall in order to better capture 'tail risk.'] Based upon a literature survey of research on Value-at-Risk (VaR), the predominant measure of financial risk assessment in the global Banking and Finance industry, this presentation outlines the case for advancing beyond VaR for better measurement of systemic financial risks. Specifying why alternatives to VaR are necessary given known inherent limitations of VaR as a measure of systemic risks, it also examines if in years preceding the Financial Crisis, specific limitations of VaR observed in course of the Crisis were foreseen by other researchers.

Additionally, we show that extreme losses suffered by important clearing firms tend to cluster, which raises systemic risk concerns.

It examines both theoretical and practical issues. Theoretically, financial risks models are models of a real and a financial “uncertainty”, based on both common and private information and economic theories defining the rules that financial markets comply to. Financial models are thus challenged by their definitions and by a changing financial system fueled by globalization, technology growth, complexity, regulation and the many factors that contribute to rendering financial processes to be continuously questioned and re-assessed. The underlying mathematical foundations of financial risks models provide future guidelines for risk modeling. The book’s chapters provide selective insights and developments that can contribute to better understand the complexity of financial modelling and its ability to bridge financial theories and their practice.   Future Perspectives in Risk Models and Finance begins with an extensive outline by Alain Bensoussan et al. of GLM estimation techniques combined with proofs of fundamental results. Applications to static and dynamic models provide a unified approach to the estimation of nonlinear risk models.  A second section is concerned with the definition of risks and their management. In particular, Guegan and Hassani review a number of risk models definition emphasizing the importance of bi-modal distributions for financial regulation. An additional chapter provides a review of stress testing and their implications. Nassim Taleb, and Sandis provide an anti-fragility approach based on “skin in the game”. To conclude, Raphael Douady discusses the noncyclical CAR (Capital Adequacy Rule) and their effects of aversion of systemic risks.  A third section emphasizes analytic financial modelling approaches and techniques. Tapiero and Vallois provide an overview of mathematical systems and their use in financial modeling. These systems span the fundamental Arrow-Debreu framework underlying financial models of complete markets and subsequently, mathematical systems departing from this framework but yet generalizing their approach to dynamic financial models. Explicitly, models based on fractional calculus, on persistence (short memory) and on entropy-based non-extensiveness. Applications of these models are used to define a modeling approach to incomplete financial models and their potential use as a “measure of incompleteness”.  Subsequently Bianchi and Pianese provide an extensive overview of multi-fractional models and their important applications to Asset price modeling. Finally, Tapiero and Jinquyi consider the binomial pricing model by discussing the effects of memory on the pricing of asset prices.",,,International Series in Operations Research & Management Science,,Springer Nature,"0884-8289, 2214-7934",,2015,2015,,2015,211,,,All OA; Green,Edited Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,1,,2.04,3.0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm:978-3-319-07524-2/1?pdf=chapter%20toc,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019780404,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for COVID-19 transmission between fire sites. We develop an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016-2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We use this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We find vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. The current set of interventions in place successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires, and off-assignment infection may be the dominant infection concern in the 2021 season. COVID-19 control measures in place in wildfire management are highly beneficial at decreasing both the health and resource impacts of the ongoing pandemic.","This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service and was funded in part by joint venture agreement number 18-JV-11221636-099 between Colorado State University and the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station.

fundamental role. The notion of hidden regular variation has the advantage that
it models both properties: asymptotic tail independence as well as heavy tails.
An alternative approach to addressing these features is via copulas. First, we
elicit connections between hidden regular variation and the behavior of tail
copula parameters extending previous works in this area. Then we study the
asymptotic behavior of the aforementioned conditional excess risk measures;
first under hidden regular variation and then under restrictions on the tail
copula parameters, not necessarily assuming hidden regular variation. We
provide a broad variety of examples of models admitting heavy tails and

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of these polymorphisms among RVO Tunisian patients with and without systemic risk factors. Seventy-two patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) were studied. The control group included140 people matched for age, sex, and risk factors. Participants in the study were genotyped for the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. The genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. No significant differences were found in the frequencies of the three genotypes (AA, AC, CC) of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism between RVO patients and healthy controls. However, the prevalence of the group of mutated genotypes (AC+CC) of the missense variant MTHFR A1298C was significantly different between patients and controls (16.67% vs. 6.42%, p=.01). Additionally, the frequency of the CT genotype as well as the group of combined mutated genotypes (CT+TT) for the C677T variant was significantly higher among RVO patients compared with controls (p<10(-3), p<10(-3)). This suggests an association between this polymorphism and RVO.

The study of human-water dynamics requires the involvement of researchers from different disciplines, including hydrology and social science. This paper tracks recent trends in socio-hydrological research using quantitative and qualitative methods. Bibliographic metrics and network analysis are used to identify general trends and illustrate the internal connections in this small but growing interdisciplinary field. Results show that hydrologists dominate research in socio-hydrology as presently defined, with far less participation from social scientists. Research questions for socio-hydrology tend to focus on system dynamics and are often not framed in a way that engages the interests and expertise of social scientists. A qualitative analysis addresses key barriers to the interdisciplinary development of socio-hydrology and identifies research needs and directions for better integration of the human dimensions of water science. Attracting social scientists to this field requires a broader conceptualization of socio-hydrology to focus on sustainable development, risk assessment, hazard management, resilience, adaptation, and knowledge mobilization in addition to hydrology’s traditional focus on systems modeling and decision support. We propose three themes for thematic focus: systemic risk and natural hazards; sustainability science; and adaptive governance. This broader framing of socio-hydrology is inherently more interdisciplinary, brings new methods and viewpoints to the field, and ensures that place-based local values are included in studies of water system dynamics.","This study is financially supported by the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Water Security and the Canada First Excellence Research Fund under Global Water Futures program, through the Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan.",,Journal of Hydrology,,Elsevier,"0022-1694, 1879-2707",,2018-08,2018,,2018-08,563,,76-83,Closed,Article,"Xu, Li; Gober, Patricia; Wheater, Howard S.; Kajikawa, Yuya","Xu, Li (Global Institute for Water Security, University of Saskatchewan, 11 Innovation Boulevard, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; School of Environment and Sustainability, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada); Gober, Patricia (Global Institute for Water Security, University of Saskatchewan, 11 Innovation Boulevard, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5302, USA); Wheater, Howard S.

Local and systemic risk factors can result in higher failure rates. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that goes in with hyperglycemia and causes multifarious side effects. Diabetes as a relative contraindication for implant surgery is controversially discussed. Because the number of patients suffering from diabetes increases, there are more diabetic patients demanding implant procedures. We aimed to answer the PICO question “Do diabetic patients with dental implants have a higher complication rate in comparison to healthy controls?” by a systematic literature search based on the PRISMA statement. We identified 22 clinical studies and 20 publications of aggregated literature, which were quite heterogeneous concerning methods and results. We conclude that patients with poorly controlled diabetes suffer from impaired osseointegration, elevated risk of peri-implantitis, and higher level of implant failure. The influence of duration of the disease is not fully clear. The supportive administration of antibiotics and chlorhexidine seems to improve implant success. When diabetes is under well control, implant procedures are safe and predictable with a complication rate similar to that of healthy patients.","The authors appreciate the technical support by Andreas Reinhardt, Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery University Hospital Kiel.",,International Journal of Implant Dentistry,,Springer Nature,2198-4034,,2016-02-11,2016,2016-02-11,2016-12,2,1,5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Naujokat, Hendrik; Kunzendorf, Burkhard; Wiltfang, Jörg","Naujokat, Hendrik (Klinik für Mund- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Straße 3, 24105, Kiel, Germany); Kunzendorf, Burkhard (Klinik für Mund- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Straße 3, 24105, Kiel, Germany); Wiltfang, Jörg (Klinik für Mund- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Straße 3, 24105, Kiel, Germany)","Naujokat, Hendrik (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein)","Naujokat, Hendrik (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein); Kunzendorf, Burkhard (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein); Wiltfang, Jörg (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein)",University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein,grid.412468.d,Kiel,,Germany,,,,,,149,79,7.5,48.96,4.0,https://journalimplantdent.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40729-016-0038-2,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041130930,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,Bioengineering; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Diabetes; Patient Safety,Metabolic and endocrine,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

The clinical picture is typically characterized by very painful skin lesions and ulcerations following calcification and occlusion of small cutaneous arterioles. CUA is life-threatening due to infections and concomitant cardiovascular diseases.
METHODS: We performed a literature search for the terms calciphylaxis and calcific uremic arteriolopathy and summarized current state-of-the-art knowledge about pathophysiology, clinical picture, course of the disease, as well as treatment options. We have filled out the literature data with our personal treatment experiences.
RESULTS: A combination of various local and systemic risk factors are necessary to cause the development of calciphylaxis. This pathophysiological cascade is still incompletely understood. Patients with advanced CKD and dialysis patients are especially at risk to develop CUA. Regarding therapy, no randomized prospective trials are available, and treatment is rather based on pathophysiological considerations as well as on evidence derived from case reports or case series. Therapy focuses on optimized dialysis treatment, control of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder parameters, experimental anticalcification strategies and wound care.
CONCLUSION: Facing the still deleterious outcome of patients with calciphylaxis, further studies on prophylaxis as well as treatment are urgently needed. Current treatment strategies may help ameliorate the course of the disease in some patients. However, it is still unclear if they are able to decrease mortality.",,,Journal of Nephrology,,SAGE Publications,"1121-8428, 1724-6059",Arterioles; Calcinosis; Calciphylaxis; Chelating Agents; Chronic Disease; Humans; Kidney Diseases; Skin; Thiosulfates,2011-02-20,2011,2011-02-20,2011-03-03,24,2,142-8,Closed,Article,"Brandenburg, Vincent M; Cozzolino, Mario; Ketteler, Markus","Brandenburg, Vincent M (Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Aachen, Aachen, Germany.

409,pub.1147877531,10.36646/mjlr.45.1.addressing,,,,Addressing Gaps in the Dodd-Frank Act: Directors' Risk Management Oversight Obligations,"In the years leading to the recent financial crisis, finance theorists introduced innovative methods, including quantitative financial models and derivative instruments, to measure and mitigate risk exposure. During the financial crisis, financial institutions facing insolvency revealed pervasive misunderstandings, misapplications, and mistaken assumptions regarding these complex risk management methods. As losses in financial markets escalated and caused liquidity and solvency crises, commentators sharply criticized directors and executives at large financial institutions for their risk management decisions. By adopting the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Congress directly and indirectly addresses certain risk management oversight concerns at large, complex financial institutions. To improve risk management oversight at these institutions, Congress imposed several structural reforms altering the composition and obligations of financial institutions' boards of directors. Unfortunately, even after the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act reforms, financial institutions remain vulnerable to the same critical errors in enterprise risk management oversight that engendered systemic risk concerns during the recent financial crisis. While the Dodd-Frank Act may enhance a board's risk management oversight capabilities, significant concerns persist regarding reliance on board committees. Organizational literature suggests that cognitive biases and structural limitations that influence group decision making will continue to plague boards' efforts to effectively manage risk.

This has triggered a debate over whether this increase can be attributed solely to fundamental factors or whether part of the increase represents redenomination risk that one or more countries will drop out of the European Monetary Union and reintroduce their own national currencies. Using a novel market‐based indicator from the virtual prediction market Intrade, this paper explores whether such systemic risk is present in the yield spreads of nine euro‐area countries. We find that redenomination risk has played a role in the determination of sovereign yields, and that this risk is related to the expected valuations of newly introduced currencies: those of Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy are expected to depreciate, while newly introduced currencies of other countries are expected to appreciate following a break‐up of the EMU. ‘Risk premia that are related to fears of the reversibility of the Euro are unacceptable, and they need to be addressed in a fundamental manner.’ (ECB President Mario Draghi, August 2012) ‘Es gibt fundamentale Zweifel der Märkte an der Sicherheit der Währungsunion.’ There are fundamental doubts on the financial markets about the integrity of the [European] monetary union.

This disease affects both men and women, but there are certain differences in the development and progression of the disease in different sexes.  Aim: To study associations of polymorphic loci of candidate genes with the risk of developing knee ОА in the male population of the Central Chernozem region of Russia.   Material and Methods. The study sample included 410 men (208 patients with knee OA and 202 controls). Ten polymorphic loci of candidate genes were genotyped: rs2820436 and rs2820443 LYPLAL1 , rs3771501 TGFA , rs11177 GNL3 , rs6976 GLT8D1 , rs1060105 and rs56116847 SBNO1 , rs6499244 NFAT5 , rs34195470 WWP2 , rs143384 GDF5 . The study of associations of polymorphic genetic loci with the development of the disease was carried out by the method of logistic regression, taking into account covariates (age, BMI). The MB-MDR method was used to study intergenic interactions of polymorphisms associated with the disease.   Results and Discussion. It was found that nine out of ten polymorphic loci of candidate genes (with the exception of rs6976 GLT8D1 ) are associated with the formation of knee OA in men in four models of interlocus interactions (p perm ≤ 0.024). The rs3771501 TGFA polymorphic locus (included in three of the four most significant models of gene-gene interactions) demonstrates the greatest contribution to the development of the disease in men. Independent effects of the studied polymorphic loci of candidate genes in the development of knee OA in men have not been identified (р > 0,05).   Conclusion. Polymorphic loci rs2820436 and rs2820443 LYPLAL1 , rs3771501 TGFA , rs11177 GNL3 , rs6976 GLT8D1 , rs1060105 and rs56116847 SBNO1 , rs6499244 NFAT5 , rs34195470 WWP2 , rs143384 GDF5 involved in the development of knee osteoarthritis in men in four models of intergenic interactions.

We apply statistical extreme value analysis to the tails of bank equity capital losses to estimate the likelihood of individual institutions' financial distress as well as individual banks' exposure to each other (“spillover risk”) and to global shocks (“extreme” systematic risk). The estimation procedure presupposes that bank equity returns are “heavy tailed” and “tail dependent” as identifying assumption. Using both US and eurozone banks allows one to make a cross-Atlantic comparison of tail risks and systemic stability. We also assess to what extent magnitudes of tail risk and systemic risk have been altered by the global financial crisis.

The time-series characteristics of the market crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resemble that of economic shocks. In the stock network by the minimal spanning tree, economic shocks after events are weakened through the market correction and show different linkage structure of stock networks, while according to stronger shocks after the event continuously, COVID-19 pandemic maintain a similar structure of stock network, regardless of market correction. In the stock network with significant information flow determined by Granger causality, economic shocks show characteristics of significant information flow as a signal before the event day, and the increasing trend of significant information flow gradually disappears. However, the COVID-19 pandemic does not show the characteristic of significant information flow as a signal before the event, and suddenly, significant information flow appears with increasing trend on the day of the event, and in particular, this characteristic is continuously observed in the subsequent period.

606,pub.1135159896,10.4314/saaj.v20i1.6,,,,The contribution of South Africa’s insurers to systemic risk: thoughts for policymakers,"The rationale for regulating financial markets is strong. First, these markets have a critical role to play in the well-being of economies of all sizes. Second, the consequences of failure of these markets is frequently felt well outside of the markets themselves. This regulation should be based on the foundation of a clearly-written publicly-stated set of objectives. One of these objectives ought to be the mitigation of systemic risk, that is the risk that the actions of a financial-sector entity could trigger widespread damage to large parts of the financial markets and to the real economy. Establishing and utilising an appropriate mix of regulatory methods, however, is rendered extraordinarily challenging by the intrinsic complexity, delicacy even, of these markets. This paper explores these issues, applies them to insurance markets, in general and then in South Africa, and asks whether more could be done by South Africa’s insurance regulators to mitigate the systemic risk attributable to the country’s insurers. At heart is the concern that increasingly sophisticated efforts to measure and manage entity-specific risk may have the consequence of adding materially to systemic risk.

We reviewed serial coronary arteriograms of 50 patients with coronary artery disease retrospectively. Patients were managed with standard treatment including anti-hypertensives, antiplatelets, lipid-lowering agents and other risk factor management by attending physician's decision. Patients who received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft or thrombolysis were excluded. Cononary arteriographies were undertaken with average 33 months interval. Criteria for the progression and regression were the changes of the luminal diameter narrowing of the arterial segment by 20% or more reduction or increase, respectively. Patients show progressive change, regressive change or no significant interval change in 50%, 12% and 30% of total 50 patients, respectively. Male gender, angiographic interval were the significant predictor of progressive change. In terms of coronary segment, stable segments are most frequent 52.2% (72/138) and progression in 40.2% (74/184), regression in 27.5% (38/138). Initial coronary lesions with low grade stenosis (less than 50%) have a tendency to progress than that of high grade stenosis (70% or more) Percentage diameter stenosis of new lesion are not related linearly with the interval between two sequential angiographies. Number of patients with progressive coronary arteriogram are more frequent than the patients with regressive change or no interval change. Progression and regression are frequent finding of serial coronary arteriography in usual clinical practice. Progression and regression are found frequently in the same patient at different coronary branches (16 patients).

In this study we addressed the molecular and cellular effects of elevated and suppressed levels of circulating cholesterol on the normal prostate. Integrated bioinformatic analysis was performed using DNA microarray data from two experimental formats: (1) ventral prostate from male mice with chronically elevated circulating cholesterol and (2) human prostate cells exposed acutely to cholesterol depletion. A cholesterol-sensitive gene expression network was constructed from these data and the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a prominent node in the network. Validation experiments confirmed that elevated cholesterol reduced ATF3 expression and enhanced proliferation of prostate cells, while cholesterol depletion increased ATF3 levels and inhibited proliferation. Cholesterol reduction in vivo alleviated dense lymphomononuclear infiltrates in the periprostatic adipose tissue, which were closely associated with nerve tracts and blood vessels. These findings open new perspectives on the role of cholesterol in prostate health, and provide a novel role for ATF3, and associated proteins within a large signaling network, as a cholesterol-sensing mechanism.",,"Funding: This work was supported by the following funding sources: National Institutes of Health grants R01 DK087806, R01 CA143777 and P50 DK65298 (to MRF); R01 CA101046 (to KRS); and NCI K99 CA131472 (to DDV); the Fishbein Family IC Research Foundation/Interstitial Cystitis Association (ICA), Pilot Research Program/ICA, New York Academy of Medicine, and Children’s Hospital Boston Faculty Development (to Jayoung Kim).

In recent years, the Israeli central bank has imposed protective regulation on mortgage loans in order to protect the banking system from systemic risk associated with highly leveraged homeowners. Using a unique and detailed dataset on mortgage loans from 2011 to 2016, we empirically estimate the impact of these restrictions on household choices and the housing market. In particular, we examine borrowers’ response to the three following regulatory restrictions: a payment-to-income (PTI) limit of 50%, a 2/3 limit on the adjustable rate component, and a 30-year maturity limit. We found that overall, the regulatory provisions tested served as an anchor to the borrowers. The most unexpected result we obtained was an increase in mortgage loans maturity following the imposed maturity limit. We concluded that the anchoring and adjustment heuristic may have influenced households’ decision in such a way that they perceived the maximum maturity limit as a relevant average maturity anchor and consequentially increased mortgage maturity.",,,,Measuring the Effectiveness of Real Estate Regulation,Springer Nature,,,2020-03-20,2020,2020-03-20,2020,,,173-189,Closed,Chapter,"Mugerman, Yevgeny; Ofir, Moran","Mugerman, Yevgeny (Finance Department, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel); Ofir, Moran (Harry Radzyner Law School, Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Herzliya, Israel)","Mugerman, Yevgeny (Bar-Ilan University)","Mugerman, Yevgeny (Bar-Ilan University); Ofir, Moran (Reichman University)",Reichman University; Bar-Ilan University,grid.21166.32; grid.22098.31,Herzliya; Ramat Gan,; ,Israel; Israel,,,,,,4,2,,2.41,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125763292,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,"C13 Architecture, Built Environment and Planning",,dims

Using quantile regressions applied to daily data for 33 countries, we investigate herding during the Eurozone crisis, China's market crash in 2015-2016, and in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. We find significant evidence of herding behavior driven by negative tail market conditions for most countries. Analyzing the spillover of herding during these three events, our results show cross-country herding effects from the Eurozone, China and the United Kingdom, with Brexit playing the most significant role in the negative co-movement of world stock exchanges. This study also investigates the relationship between herding and systemic risk, suggesting that herding increases when systemic risk increases. Granger causality tests and Johansen's vector error-correction model provide solid empirical evidence of a strong interrelationship between herding and systemic risk, entailing that herding behavior may be an ex-ante aspect of systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Vioto, Davide; Tunaru, Radu; Hasan, Iftekhar","Vioto, Davide (European Banking Authority (EBA)); Tunaru, Radu (University of Sussex); Hasan, Iftekhar (Fordham University ; Bank of Finland; University of Sydney)",,"Vioto, Davide (); Tunaru, Radu (University of Sussex); Hasan, Iftekhar ()",University of Sussex,grid.12082.39,Brighton,,United Kingdom,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146635106,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This framework conceptualises financial systems through the lens of five building blocks: financial institutions, contracts, markets, constraints, and behaviour. Using this framework, we implement a system-wide stress test for the European financial system. We obtain three key findings. First, the financial system may be stable or unstable for a given microprudential stress test outcome, depending on the system’s shock-amplifying tendency. Second, the ‘usability’ of banks’ capital buffers (the willingness of banks to use buffers to absorb losses) is of great consequence to systemic resilience. Third, there is a risk that the size of capital buffers needed to limit systemic risk could be severely underestimated if calibrated in the absence of system-wide approaches.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Farmer, J.

                  This article analyses the impact of asset and activity diversification on the stability of major financial institutions. Diversification is typically viewed as a positive element in risk management. However, examining recent examples concerning diversified multinational financial institutions and a theoretical model of failure risk facing them, this article demonstrates that under certain conditions, diversification can actually increase systemic risk. Financial conglomerates can be ‘too big to manage’, they can become too similar to each other and susceptible to coordinated failure, and, most importantly, catastrophic losses in one part of the firm can overwhelm the whole firm. Based on this finding, this article proposes a number of mitigation measures to limit intra-firm spillover and to make the resolution of troubled financial institutions smoother.",,,Journal of Financial Regulation,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"2053-4833, 2053-4841",,2019-10-15,2019,2019-10-15,2020-01-17,5,2,179-219,Closed,Article,"Jin, Kwon-Yong","Jin, Kwon-Yong (Judge Advocate, Republic of Korea Air Force)",,"Jin, Kwon-Yong ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,3.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117577907,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",Clinical Research,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Despite the fact that emboli to the ophthalmic artery (OA) and middle cerebral artery share the internal carotid artery (ICA) as a common origin or transit for emboli, the asymmetry in their final destination has not been fully explained. We hypothesize that the anatomic location of the OA takeoff from the ICA may contribute to the differential flow of small emboli to the retinal circulation vs the cerebral circulation.
METHODS: We report a retrospective, comparative, case-control study on 28 patients with retinal ischemia and 26 patients with TIA or cerebral infarction caused by embolic events. All subjects underwent either computed tomography angiography or MRA. The location of the ipsilateral OA origin off the ICA was then graded in a blinded fashion and compared between cohorts. Vascular risk factors were collected for all patients, including age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and smoking.
RESULTS: We find that in patients with retinal ischemia of embolic etiology, the ipsilateral OA takeoff from the ICA is more proximal than in patients with cerebral infarcts or TIA (P = 0.0002). We found no statistically significant differences in demographic, vascular, or systemic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that the mean anatomical location of the OA takeoff from the ICA is significantly more proximal in patients with MVL due to retinal ischemia compared with patients with TIA or cerebral ischemia. This finding contributes significantly to our understanding of a long observed but poorly understood phenomenon that patients with MVL are less likely to have concurrent cerebral ischemia than are patients with TIA.",,,Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology,,Wolters Kluwer,"1070-8022, 1536-5166","Aged; Brain Ischemia; Carotid Artery, Internal; Case-Control Studies; Computed Tomography Angiography; Embolism; Female; Humans; Intracranial Embolism; Ischemia; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmic Artery; Retinal Artery; Retinal Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",2020-01-24,2020,2020-01-24,2021-03,41,1,24-28,Closed,Article,"Rossin, Elizabeth J; Gilbert, Aubrey L; Koen, Nicholas; Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M; Cunnane, Mary E; Rizzo, Joseph F","Rossin, Elizabeth J (Neuro-Ophthalmology Service (EJR, ALG, JFR), Harvard Medical School, Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, Massachusetts; Vitreoretinal Surgery Service (EJR), Harvard Medical School, Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, Massachusetts; Neuro-Ophthalmology (ALG), Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, Northern California; Department of Otolaryngology (NK), Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, Massachusetts; The Warren Alpert Medical School (NK), Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island; Neurointerventional Service (TML-M), Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; and Department of Radiology (MEC), Harvard Medical School Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, Massachusetts.); Gilbert, Aubrey L (); Koen, Nicholas (); Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M (); Cunnane, Mary E (); Rizzo, Joseph F ()",,"Rossin, Elizabeth J (Kaiser Permanente; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary; Brown University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University); Gilbert, Aubrey L (); Koen, Nicholas (); Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M (); Cunnane, Mary E (); Rizzo, Joseph F ()",Brown University; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Kaiser Permanente,grid.40263.33; grid.39479.30; grid.32224.35; grid.38142.3c; grid.280062.e,Providence; Boston; Boston; Cambridge; Oakland,Rhode Island; Massachusetts; Massachusetts; Massachusetts; California,United States; United States; United States; United States; United States,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,5.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124344437,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Aging; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Neurosciences; Prevention; Stroke,,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,,dims

METHODS: 42 patients (22 male and 20 female) were recruited from January 2016 to December 2017. Intravenous methylprednisolone and/or intratympanic corticosteroid were used as salvage therapy. The main measures included systemic risk factors and audiometric outcomes as proposed by American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Hearing Loss Scale. All individuals were assessed at baseline, discharge (2 weeks post-treatment) and at 1, 3 and 6 months.
RESULTS: The mean ages of patients were 39.3 ± 14.8 yrs. Cardiovascular disorders were seen in 19.0-33.3% of cases. Restoration of hearing and speech discrimination abilities were assessed at the first month post-treatment versus initial levels (95.5 ± 15.5 vs. 109.2 ± 9.6 dB, p = 0.000; and 17.6 ± 24.4 vs. 1.3 ± 4.0%, p = 0.003, respectively). Word recognition scores continued to recover at month 6 (38.7 ± 35.4%, p = 0.000), whereas puretone ceased to change (90.8 ± 16.2 dB, p = 0.139). The final percentages of complete, partial and no recovery were 0%, 57.1% and 42.9% respectively. The prognosis was independent of accompanying systemic risk factors as analyzed in this study. Intratympanic intervention was associated with improved word recognition scores, although intravenous corticosteroid was not.

Evidence from the Recent Crisis,"Deposit insurance is widely offered in a number of countries as part of a financial system safety net to promote stability. An unintended consequence of deposit insurance is the reduction in the incentive of depositors to monitor banks which lead to excessive risk-taking. We examine the relation between deposit insurance and bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to and during the recent financial crisis. We find that generous financial safety nets increase bank risk and systemic fragility in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. However, during the crisis, bank risk is lower and systemic stability is greater in countries with deposit insurance coverage. Our findings suggest that the “moral hazard effect” of deposit insurance dominates in good times while the “stabilization effect” of deposit insurance dominates in turbulent times. The overall effect of deposit insurance over the full sample we study remains negative since the destabilizing effect during normal times is greater in magnitude compared to the stabilizing effect during global turbulence. In addition, we find that good bank supervision can alleviate the unintended consequences of deposit insurance on bank systemic risk during good times, suggesting that fostering the appropriate incentive framework is very important for ensuring systemic stability.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2012,2012,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Anginer, Deniz; Demirgüç-Kunt, Asli; Zhu, Min","Anginer, Deniz (World Bank Research); Demirgüç-Kunt, Asli (World Bank - Development Research Group; World Bank); Zhu, Min (City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK); World Bank - Development Research Group; University of Michigan, Stephen M.

A multi-agent model is employed to build an artificial economy with households, firms, and banks where occasional liquidity crises emerge. The systemic importance of banks is captured by a score-based mechanism reflecting banks' characteristics in terms of size or interconnectedness. We compare three degrees of heterogeneity in the configuration of financial networks related to different banking concentrations in the loan market. The main findings suggest that: (i) reducing the heterogeneity of the banking network stabilizes the economy by itself; (ii) the identification criteria of systemic-important institutions are affected by the heterogeneity of networks; it is preferable applying systemic capital surcharges to the largest banks under high heterogeneity and targeting those most interconnected under low heterogeneity; (iii) the effectiveness of systemic capital buffers is preserved under high heterogeneity when a common asset holding contagion channel is added. However, simple measures based on risk-weighted assets capital ratios appear to be more effective in low heterogeneous systems. Thus, we argue that prudential regulation should account for the characteristics of the banking networks and tune macroprudential tools accordingly.","The authors would like to thank Giampaolo Gabbi and Marco Bardoscia for helpful comments and suggestions, as well as participants of the Minsky at 100 conference in Milan, the 2020 ABM4Policy seminar series, the 69th AFSE meeting, the 27th Computing in Economics and Finance International Conference, the 2021 Deutsche Bundesbank Research Seminars, the 24.5th Workshop on Economics With Heterogeneous Interacting Agents.

While LTV/DSTI limits can increase inequality at introduction, they can dampen the increase in inequality under adverse macroeconomic conditions. The relative size of these opposing effects is an empirical question. We conduct counterfactual simulations under different macroeconomic and macroprudential policy scenarios using granular income and wealth data from the Households Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) for Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal.

We extend CoVaR (value-at-risk conditioned on an institution) and CoCVaR (conditional value-at-risk conditioned on an institution) systemic risk contribution measures and propose a new CoCDaR (conditional drawdown-at-risk conditioned on an institution) measure based on drawdowns. This new measure accounts for consecutive negative returns of a security, while CoVaR and CoCVaR combine together negative returns from different time periods. For instance, ten 2% consecutive losses resulting in 20% drawdown will be noticed by CoCDaR, while CoVaR and CoCVaR are not sensitive to relatively small one period losses. The proposed measure provides insights for systemic risks under extreme stresses related to drawdowns. CoCDaR and its multivariate version, mCoCDaR, estimate an impact on big cumulative losses of the entire financial system caused by an individual firm’s distress. It can be used for ranking individual systemic risk contributions of financial institutions (banks). CoCDaR and mCoCDaR are computed with CVaR regression of drawdowns. Moreover, mCoCDaR can be used to estimate drawdowns of a security as a function of some other factors. For instance, we show how to perform fund drawdown style classification depending on drawdowns of indices.

How financial institutions can remain compliant with this ever expanding financial legal framework, has been a pressing question since. This contribution explores the potential of RegTech solutions to ensure abidance with the law. RegTech can be defined as the use of technological solutions to facilitate compliance with and monitoring of regulatory requirements. In recent legal doctrine, RegTech is almost unequivocally hailed as holding the promise of substantial gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced risk of human errors and resulting administrative fines. Underexposed in legal doctrine and regulatory reports on this topic are, however, the risks and challenges of RegTech solutions. This contribution highlights those risks and challenges, including new sources of systemic risk, elevated costs, data protection concerns and problematic side-effects of “dehumanization”. As RegTech nevertheless seems to be one of the very few answers to the compliance challenge, several strategies to remedy or contain each of these challenges are presented. Finally, this contribution underlines the crucial role of the financial supervisor as an intermediary between legislator and financial institutions in a RegTech era. RegTech indeed accelerates the evolution towards a cooperative supervisory model, in which the supervisor guides financial institutions in their search for adequate and correct compliance and in which financial institutions in turn deliver essential input to supervisors for the development of efficient guidelines, best practices and RegTech solutions.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Colaert, Veerle","Colaert, Veerle (KU Leuven Law Faculty)",,"Colaert, Veerle ()",,,,,,,,,,,10,6,,7.28,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102445007,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",Patient Safety,Generic health relevance,,,,C18 Law,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Overlapping portfolios and assets correlation of banks’ investment are important reasons for systemic risk contagion. The existing systemic risk models are all analyzed from one aspect and cannot reflect the real situation of the banking system. In the present paper, considering the overlapping portfolios and assets correlation, a contagion network model with multi-channel risk is proposed, which is with interbank lending (direct contagion channel), overlapping portfolios (indirect contagion channel), and assets correlation (indirect contagion channel). In addition, the model takes investment risk as an impact factor and learns the operation rules of the banking system to help banks compensate for liquidity through asset depreciation. Based on the proposed model, the effects of assets correlation, assets diversity, assets investment strategy, interbank network structure, and the impact of market density on risk contagion are studied and analyzed quantitatively. The method in this paper can more truly reflect the banking system risk than the existing model.

At the same time due to the lack of historical data, closed financial markets and poor experience, number of researches devoted to corporate credit risk estimation is strongly limited, especially for emerging market economies. Loans to corporates represent a significant part of Russian banking portfolio: to the end of 2013 loans to corporates reached 56% of total credit portfolio and 39% of total assets of Russian banks. Meanwhile the level of non-performing loans in corporate portfolio is increasing - this fact can lead to instability of Russian financial and banking system. Thereby this is increasingly important to develop and enhance approaches to modeling of credit risk for corporates; moreover such approaches should take into account institutional features and characteristics of Russian market. The key purpose of our research is to develop an empirical model for estimation default probability of potential corporate clients of Russian banks. To achieve this purpose it is necessary to perform the following:collect the sample of  financial indicators (profitability, financial stability, business activity etc.) for defaulted and non-defaulted companies and macro factors for the specified period;execute a statistical analysis to determine the risk-dominant financial indicators and risk- sensitive macro factors;execute a multivariable analysis to build sets of logit model based on risk-dominant financial indicators and macro factors;analyze the quality and predictive power of final model and represent the economic justification and interpretation of the observed relationship.Within modeling of default probability of corporates is important to execute industry clustering, because each cluster can have a specific type of relationships between explanatory variables and different degrees of exposure to systemic risks. Within this work we represented the approach of default modeling for construction companies as the most widespread for the Russian banking market. Object of our research – the construction companies which are potential corporate clients of Russian commercial banks. Subject is assessment of default probabilities of these companies based on conditional logit model.We used the sample which consists of 636 financial statements of construction corporate companies. This sample includes financial statements of 159 defaulted companies which gone to bankruptcy during 2005-2013 and 477 «healthy» companies. Sample was extracted from analytical system FIRA PRO. In order to take into account cyclicality factor and level of systematic risk this is also have a sense to take into account the macro indicators. Based on statistical and regression analysis we identified the optimal set of risk- dominance financial indicators (profitability, financial stability, business activity etc.) and macro indicators. This set of variables was used for multivariate analysis based on logit models. Based on quantitative characteristic of sets of multivariate models we chose the best models in terms of the level of predictive power. The predictive power of the final models was also analyzed based on classification tables. As a result the models presented in our research allow to estimate the default probabilities of the Russian companies of construction industry based on comprehensive sets of risk-dominance financial and macro factors.Correct credit risk assessment plays an essential role in the stability of the financial system. As a result of the credit risk underestimation bank can face with significant losses and decreasing of credit portfolio quality.  Meanwhile, during the assessing of the credit risk we also should take into account the existence of cyclicality effect and dynamics of macro indicators in this case credit risk assessment will be more timely and accurate. Significant share of credit portfolio of Russian banks is lending to companies in the construction industry. Moreover, the crisis of 2007 -2009 years showed that companies in the construction industry are highly susceptible to systemic risk and macroeconomic shocks.  It is extremely important to develop the approaches to estimation of credit risk level for such companies; these models should take into account not only internal factors like return of assets, profitability, financial leverage etc. but also should include external factors that can explain the level of non-diversified risk in the construction industry. Given the increased volatility in the financial markets, decreasing the quality of banking credit portfolios and increasing the complexity of the modern financial markets, the relevance of this research topic is increasingly important.

Since its inception, the credit derivatives market has grown to a peak of $64 trillion in 2008 in terms of gross notional values (Cont, 2010). However, after the onset of the GFC, this market has decreased to a large extent. While there is evidence that promotes the risk reduction properties of CDSs, there is a growing body of research post GFC that identifies destabilising effects of these instruments. In this paper, I review the relevant scholarly literature and provide evidence of how the views on CDSs have changed post GFC due a deeper investigation of issues such as systemic risk, regulatory arbitrage, information asymmetry and risk‐taking, among others, in the banking industry. This paper provides a survey of the literature of views ‘for’ and ‘against’ the use of CDSs during pre and post GFC periods and finally concludes that in comparison to the pre GFC period, post GFC there is a significant increase in the literature that highlights the detrimental nature of CDSs.","I would like to thank Prof. Christine Jubb, Prof. Kevin Davis and three anonymous referees for their insightful comments and suggestions.",,Journal of Economic Surveys,,Wiley,"0950-0804, 1467-6419",,2015-03-19,2015,2015-03-19,2016-09,30,4,712-735,Closed,Article,"Dias, Roshanthi","Dias, Roshanthi (Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne)","Dias, Roshanthi (Swinburne University of Technology)","Dias, Roshanthi (Swinburne University of Technology)",Swinburne University of Technology,grid.1027.4,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia,,,,,,4,1,,1.58,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030552524,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

These diffusions represent the distances-to-default of financial institutions, and absorption at zero corresponds to default. As a way of modelling correlated exposures and herd behaviour, we consider a common source of noise and a form of mean-reversion in the drift. Moreover, we introduce an endogenous contagion mechanism whereby the default of one institution causes a drop in the distances-to-default of the other institutions. In this way, we aim to capture key ‘system-wide’ effects on risk. The resulting mean-field limit is characterised uniquely by a nonlinear SPDE on the half-line with a Dirichlet boundary condition. The density of this SPDE gives the conditional law of a non-standard ‘conditional’ McKean–Vlasov diffusion, for which we provide a novel upper Dirichlet heat kernel type estimate. Depending on the realisations of the common noise and the rate of mean-reversion, the SPDE can exhibit rapid accelerations in the loss of mass at the boundary. In other words, the contagion mechanism can give rise to periods of significant systemic default clustering.","We thank two anonymous referees and the Associate Editor for their careful reading and suggestions for improvements, which has helped sharpen the presentation of this paper.",,Finance and Stochastics,,Springer Nature,"0949-2984, 1432-1122",,2019-06-10,2019,2019-06-10,2019-07,23,3,535-594,All OA; Green,Article,"Hambly, Ben; Søjmark, Andreas","Hambly, Ben (Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK); Søjmark, Andreas (Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)","Søjmark, Andreas (University of Oxford)","Hambly, Ben (University of Oxford); Søjmark, Andreas (University of Oxford)",University of Oxford,grid.4991.5,Oxford,Oxfordshire,United Kingdom,,,,,,20,12,,12.05,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10088,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117013886,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4905 Statistics",,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,,dims

226,pub.1106426274,10.2139/ssrn.3237354,,,,"Reviving the Shadow Banking Chain in Europe: Regulatory Agency, Technical Complexity and the Dynamics of Co-Habitation","In recent years European financial regulation has experienced a tremendous reorientation with respect to the shadow banking system, which manifested first and foremost in its reframing as market-based finance. Initially identified as a source of systemic risk certain initiatives did not only fall much behind the envisaged changes but all to the contrary have been substantially modified in a way that they now aim at revitalizing these activities. The reorientation of European regulatory agency on shadow banking post-crisis, from curtailing it to facilitating resilient market-based finance, has been a cause for irritation by academic observers, dismissed by some as mere rebranding or taken as a sign of regulatory capture. All to the contrary, this paper documents the central role of regulatory agency in shadow banking’s reconfiguration. It does so by analyzing the European initiatives concerning the regulation of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) and another prime example of shadow banking, Money Market Mutual Funds (MMFs). Based on documentary analysis and expert interviews we trace the way the recently published EU frameworks for MMFs and ABCP have been designed (in particular the STS, CRR and MMF regulation in 2017). Furthermore, we show how they have been transformed in such a way that their final versions allow to re-establish the shadow banking chain linking MMFs, the ABCP market and arguably the regular banking system. This transformation is driven by a new form of pro-active European regulatory agency which aims at creating a regulatory infrastructure able to sustain the orderly flow of real economy debt. Far from being captured by the industry, they did so consciously and in cooperation with private actors in order to maintain a channel for credit creation outside of bank credit, a task made more complicated by the rushed politicized final negotiations coupled with technical complexity. This paper thereby contributes to a new strand of literature, seeing the creation and reconfiguration of the shadow banking system as characterized by the active and conscious role of state actors.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Endrejat, Vanessa; Thiemann, Matthias","Endrejat, Vanessa (Goethe University Frankfurt, Students); Thiemann, Matthias (Goethe University Frankfurt)",,"Endrejat, Vanessa (Goethe University Frankfurt); Thiemann, Matthias (Goethe University Frankfurt)",Goethe University Frankfurt,grid.7839.5,Frankfurt am Main,Hessen,Germany,,,,,,2,0,,1.84,,http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/47234/SSRN-id3237354.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106426274,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

In this way, the authors use different variables and statistical tools, and techniques. The impact of the economic environment and data availability limits the introduction of certain variables in bankruptcy prediction models. The paper aims to explore attitudes in existing literature regarding the selection of variables used to develop models for predicting bankruptcy, their characteristics, limitations, and impact on the power of predictions. The labor findings show that the historical character of the data and the conservative approach to financial reporting have turned authors to the use of non-financial and market variables. For the most part, efficient markets absorb all external and internal information and future predictions, which are read through market prices. However, this assumption does not apply to less developed markets, and the use of market variables is questionable. In conditions of increased systemic risk, macroeconomic variables can be good indicators for predicting the likelihood of bankruptcy. Developing a model for predicting bankruptcy requires looking at the economic environment and choosing variables that correspond to existing business conditions.

435,pub.1090426398,10.2139/ssrn.2953236,,,,Safe Harbor for Derivatives in Bankruptcy: Overstayed Its Welcome?,"The safe harbor for derivatives in bankruptcy has developed over the course of the last four decades into a very powerful tool for derivatives counterparties. The safe harbor’s overall effect is to allow counterparties to terminate their derivatives instruments and immediately collect their collateral upon the debtor’s initiation of a bankruptcy. This effect flies in the face of the Bankruptcy Code’s overarching principles, which are to ensure debtor rehabilitation and equality of distribution amongst creditors. By allowing derivatives counterparties to immediately terminate and close out their positions while the other creditors are stayed, both the debtor and other creditors are severely harmed. As the safe harbor contravenes the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code, it is important to consider why it was enacted into the law. This paper begins with a detailed look at the creation of the safe harbor over time. It all began with the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, which contained a narrow safe harbor for certain derivatives instruments. Amendments to the Bankruptcy Code in 1982, 1984, and 1990 all served to dramatically increase the breadth, scope, and power of the safe harbor provisions. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 as well as the Financial Netting Improvements Act of 2006 were the final modifications to the safe harbor, and continued the pattern of enlarging its power. Overall, the safe harbor has consistently grown over time as the derivatives market increased in size and complexity. The paper next takes a detailed look at the legislative history over the decades to ascertain the purposes behind the safe harbor provisions. The legislative history paints a relatively consistent picture over all of the various amendments to the safe harbor about why this legal regime was created. The primary purpose behind the safe harbor provisions is, and has always been, to eliminate systemic risk. There has long been a fear that the size, complexity and interconnectedness of the derivatives market were so great that without special treatment it would all eventually come crashing down. However, there is also a discernible secondary purpose behind the safe harbor provisions, which is to clarify the protections for all market participants and create consistent, settled expectations for all so that the market may function effectively. As derivatives developed in complexity over time, industry participants clamored for legislation to clarify what protections extended to these new instruments and players, and Congress acquiesced to their requests. Having deduced the purposes behind the safe harbor, the next step is to determine whether those purposes were fulfilled in relation to the Financial Crisis of 2007-09. Substantial evidence from the collapses of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, and the entire residential mortgage-backed securities market suggests that not only did the safe harbor fail to achieve its stated goal of reducing systemic risk, but actually backfired and increased systemic risk, and thereby worsened the financial crisis. In light of this evidence, the paper ends by discussing two routes for reform. The first option is to repeal the safe harbor in light of the creation of the Orderly Liquidation Authority under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Orderly Liquidation Authority is a financial resolution system created specifically for the largest institutions capable of producing systemic risk. However, this paper supports the second option, which is less drastic and the one less likely to upset settled expectations. That second option proposes to narrow the safe harbor provisions in various ways so that they are more appropriately targeted at achieving their goal of reducing systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2017,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Berger, Ryan","Berger, Ryan (Duke University, School of Law, Students)",,"Berger, Ryan (Duke University)",Duke University,grid.26009.3d,Durham,North Carolina,United States,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090426398,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law,Prevention,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

Empirical results suggest that intra-industry linkages exist among insurance firms, although they are comparatively weaker than those in banking and real estate.

Independence Quantile Graphical Models (CIQGMs) and Prediction Quantile
Graphical Models (PQGMs). CIQGMs characterize the conditional independence of
distributions by evaluating the distributional dependence structure at each
quantile index. As such, CIQGMs can be used for validation of the graph
structure in the causal graphical models (\cite{pearl2009causality,
robins1986new, heckman2015causal}). One main advantage of these models is that
we can apply them to large collections of variables driven by non-Gaussian and
non-separable shocks. PQGMs characterize the statistical dependencies through
the graphs of the best linear predictors under asymmetric loss functions. PQGMs
make weaker assumptions than CIQGMs as they allow for misspecification. Because
of QGMs' ability to handle large collections of variables and focus on specific
parts of the distributions, we could apply them to quantify tail
interdependence. The resulting tail risk network can be used for measuring
systemic risk contributions that help make inroads in understanding
international financial contagion and dependence structures of returns under
downside market movements.
  We develop estimation and inference methods for QGMs focusing on the
high-dimensional case, where the number of variables in the graph is large
compared to the number of observations. For CIQGMs, these methods and results
include valid simultaneous choices of penalty functions, uniform rates of
convergence, and confidence regions that are simultaneously valid. We also
derive analogous results for PQGMs, which include new results for penalized
quantile regressions in high-dimensional settings to handle misspecification,
many controls, and a continuum of additional conditioning events.",,,arXiv,,,,,2016-07-01,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Belloni, Alexandre; Chen, Mingli; Chernozhukov, Victor","Belloni, Alexandre (); Chen, Mingli (); Chernozhukov, Victor ()",,"Belloni, Alexandre (); Chen, Mingli (); Chernozhukov, Victor ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,5.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119325303,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics",,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,,dims

However, as the carotid bifurcation ages, the bifurcation and flow waveform changes its geometry and dynamics, respectively [2, 3]. In addition to confounding systemic risk factors, such changes may interrupt homeostasis, potentially altering the likelihood of disturbed flow and atherosclerotic disease in the aging carotid bifurcation. Despite this, disturbed flow in aged bifurcations is typically inferred from image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches using representative young and healthy adult flow waveforms.Copyright © 2009 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2009 Summer Bioengineering Conference, Parts A and B",ASME International,,,2009-06-17,2009,2013-07-19,2009-06-17,,,167-168,Closed,Proceeding,"Hoi, Yiemeng; Wasserman, Bruce A.; Steinman, David A.","Hoi, Yiemeng (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada); Wasserman, Bruce A.

Severe disruptions that propagate along complex SNs can expose the population of entire regions or even countries to these risks. A lack of both, data and quantitative methodology, has hitherto hindered us to empirically quantify the vulnerability of the population to disruptions. Here we develop a data-driven simulation methodology to locally quantify actual supply losses for the population that result from the cascading of supply disruptions. We demonstrate the method on a large food SN of a European country including 22,938 business premises, 44,355 supply links and 116 local administrative districts. We rank the business premises with respect to their criticality for the districts’ population with the proposed systemic risk index, SRIcrit, to identify around 30 premises that—in case of their failure—are expected to cause critical supply shortages in sizable fractions of the population. The new methodology is immediately policy relevant as a fact-driven and generalizable crisis management tool.

Although many practitioners back this call, including insurers, shareholders with a long-term orientation, and company law specialists who suggest that the inclusion of long-term stakeholder interests is necessary to counter both corporate and systemic risks, it remains unanswered. We argue that dominant assumptions about the status and architecture of corporations in corporate governance theory stand at the centre of this unanswered call in accounting theory and practice. As the status of the public corporation is interpreted as a nexus of contracts and its architecture as a restricted dyadic relation between ‘principals’ and ‘agents’, the object and audience for corporate reports are restricted to a very specific set of actors, interests and time-horizons. We argue that this conceptual setup unduly restricts notions of accountability and is connected to a specific notion of political economy. A broadening of reporting standards needs, therefore, to be accompanied by a critical assessment of the assumed object and audience of reporting in corporate governance theory.",,,Accounting Economics and Law - A Convivium,,De Gruyter,"2194-6051, 2152-2820",,2020-02-27,2020,2020-02-27,2020-07-01,10,2,20180037,All OA; Green,Article,"Veldman, Jeroen; Jansson, Andreas","Veldman, Jeroen (Nyenrode Business University, Straatweg 25, Breukelen, The Netherlands); Jansson, Andreas (School of Business and Economics, Linnaeus University, Växjö, S-351 95, Sweden)","Veldman, Jeroen (Nyenrode Business University)","Veldman, Jeroen (Nyenrode Business University); Jansson, Andreas (Linnaeus University)",Nyenrode Business University; Linnaeus University,grid.449564.e; grid.8148.5,Breukelen; Vaxjo,; ,Netherlands; Sweden,,,,,,4,3,,2.7,1.0,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/24636/10/https___openaccess.city.ac.uk_id_eprint_24636_1_Veldman%20and%20Jansson%202020%20Planetary%20Boundaries%20and%20Corporate%20Reporting%20The%20Role%20of%20the%20Conceptual%20Basis%20of%20the%20Corporation%20-%20Accounting%20Economics%20and%20Law%20A%20Convivium_removed%20%281%29.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125598708,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Using a dynamic factor model extended with time-varying loading parameters and stochastic volatility, we observe a substantial amount of time variations in the loading parameters of the common factor– implying that the exposure of regional growth to the common national factor varies substantially. We find that the correlation in cross-region economic growth performance increased during the recent global recession and declined post-recession, albeit still at a higher level than before 2008. While the large degree of synchronization of regional growth dynamics permits the central government or central bank to implement a uniform fiscal or monetary policy, this concurrently reduces China's ability to stymie the propagation of external shocks and instead increases systemic risks across regions.",,,China Economic Review,,Elsevier,"1043-951X, 1873-7781",,2020-06,2020,,2020-06,61,,101226,Closed,Article,"Bian, Zhicun; Ma, Jun; Ni, Jinlan; Stewart, Shamar","Bian, Zhicun (School of Finance, Nanjing University of Finance and Economics, China); Ma, Jun (Department of Economics, Northeastern University, USA); Ni, Jinlan (Department of Economics, College of Business Administration, University of Nebraska at Omaha, USA; Institute of Urban Development, Nanjing Audit University, China); Stewart, Shamar (Department of Economics, Finance and Legal Studies, University of Alabama, USA)","Stewart, Shamar (University of Alabama)","Bian, Zhicun (Nanjing University of Finance and Economics); Ma, Jun (Northeastern University); Ni, Jinlan (University of Nebraska at Omaha; Nanjing Audit University); Stewart, Shamar (University of Alabama)",Nanjing University of Finance and Economics; Northeastern University; University of Nebraska at Omaha; University of Alabama; Nanjing Audit University,grid.440844.8; grid.261112.7; grid.266815.e; grid.411015.0; grid.443514.3,Nanjing; Boston; Omaha; Tuscaloosa; Nanjing,; Massachusetts; Nebraska; Alabama; ,China; United States; United States; United States; China,,,,,,1,1,,0.59,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107126210,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,,,,,,C16 Economics and Econometrics,,dims

Nonbanks, particularly CLOs, closed-end funds, and mutual funds, are more likely than bank lenders to exit the syndicate rather than to participate in the renegotiated loan. For mutual funds, greater net fund outflows imply a greater likelihood of exit, and this finding is consistent with nonbank lending creating greater systemic risk (Stein 2013). For most nonbanks, the likelihood of an exit increases if the financial condition of the borrower improves and the potential for higher spreads wanes.

Despite their different origins, banking crises display similar patterns. Their causes lie in unsustainable macroeconomic policies, market failures, regulatory distortions, and government interference in the allocation of capital; they are frequently characterized by boom-bust cycles in credit and asset prices; and they are generally resolved through large-scale government intervention. When not handled effectively and swiftly, banking crises tend to impose enormous costs to society by curtailing the flow of credit to the real economy.

We conduct the connectedness analysis from four levels (i.e., system, region, country and institution) and identify the systemic risk contribution of banks. We find that the dynamic total connectedness reached its peak during the outbreak of the abnormal fluctuations of Chinese stock market in 2015-2016 and its trough during the Brexit vote, and subsequently experienced several periodic fluctuations at a relatively high position. In the B&R banking system, the intra-regional tail risk spillovers are remarkably stronger than the inter-regional tail risk spillovers during the post-crisis period. In addition, the panel regressions estimated by the least squares dummy variable model show that the cross-border merger and acquisitions (M&As) and the merchandise trade export are important drivers for the tail-connectedness across the B&R countries.

This concentrated commonalities have far reaching implications on systemic financial risk. By subdividing banks' assets on their balance sheets into 20 types, we construct a bipartite financial network using China's data in 2019 and 2020. A linear model is proposed to measure each bank's systemic importance (SI) and indirect vulnerability (IV), and the contagion strength between pair-wise banks (C), with respect to exogenous shocks originated from different sectors of the real economy. Results show that (1) concentrated common exposure to mortgage is demonstrated to be the most significant source of systemic vulnerability; (2) the derived contagion network shows the property of ``small world"", which plays an important role in generating systemic risk, amplified non-linearly by multi-rounds of contagion; (3) Agricultural Bank of China along with seven other banks are identified as systemic important, Guangdong Development Bank as well as five other regional banks are suggested to be vulnerable, and Postal Savings Bank of China and China Construction Bank are critical nodes in transmitting risks.

Physiologically there is only a minimal amount of fluid in the suprachoroid space, pathologically the fluid volume increases, which causes ablation of the choroid. SCH could be divided into different cathegories, according to the character of the fluid into serous and haemorrhagic; by the time of occurrence in relation to the surgery into peroperative and postoperative. Diagnosis is based on biomicroscopic and ultrasound examinations. The ocular risk factors for SCH are glaucoma, myopia and aphakia; systemic risk factors include vascular fragility, arterial hypertension and blood coagulation disorders. In the pathogenesis hypotonia of the eye, that causes rupture of the ciliary vessels, plays a very important role. SCH can be treated both conservatively and surgically. As to pharmacotherapy we use gabapentin to suppress neuropathic pain and prednisone, topical mydriatics and anti-inflammatory agents. The type of surgical treatment differs according to time of occurrence, if SCH occurs during the operation, the intervention consists mainly in the wound closure and the repositioning of the weakening tissues; in postoperative forms, we choose drainage procedures, possibly vitreoretinal procedures. Our patient, an 80-year-old myop and chronic glaucomatic treated intensively both topically and systematically underwent trabeculectomy on his left eye due to unsatisfactory intraocular pressure (IOP) and significant glaucoma progression. The surgical intervention went without any complications. In the early post-operative period, there was persisting elevation of IOP, therefore sclera lap was discontinued and 5-fluorouracil was applied under the filter blister. Subsequent hypotonia caused a hemorrhagic SCH with intraocular hypertension, which was resolved by draining the blood with sclerotomias and thus releasing intraocular hypertension. The visual acuity of the left eye gradually improved to almost original values. Intraocular pressure, however, is not well compensated despite many following antiglaucoma surgeries. Therefore, even with the patients maximum therapy, glaucoma continues to progress. In our case, we confirm that it is possible to solve even the relatively most complicated cases of SCH. We stress the necessity to consider the presence of risk factors of the occurrence of SCH before indicating intraocular procedures and also recommend thinking carefully about other less invasive surgical techniques. In glaucoma, it is appropriate taking in account the prediction of life compared to the expected rate of progression of vision loss.",,,Czech and Slovak Ophthalmology,,Czech Society of Ophthalmology of the CzMA,"1211-9059, 1805-4447, 18054447","Aged, 80 and over; Choroid Hemorrhage; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Postoperative Complications; Tonometry, Ocular; Trabeculectomy; Treatment Outcome",2019-02-21,2019,2019-07-02,2019-02-21,75,2,92-98,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Středová, Markéta; Hejsek, Libor; Nekolová, Jana; Jirásková, Naďa","Středová, Markéta (Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Hradec Králové); Hejsek, Libor (Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Hradec Králové); Nekolová, Jana (Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Hradec Králové); Jirásková, Naďa (Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Hradec Králové)",,"Středová, Markéta (); Hejsek, Libor (); Nekolová, Jana (); Jirásková, Naďa ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,0.41,,https://www.cs-ophthalmology.cz/en/journal/2/articles/116/dl/323,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121126799,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Aging; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Eye,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors; 4.1 Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies; 6.4 Surgery,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,,dims

The concept of ""too connected to fail"" suggests that network connectedness plays an important role in measuring systemic risk. In this paper, we first recover a time series of Bayesian networks for stock returns, which allow the direction of links among stock returns to be formed with Markov properties in directed graphs. We rank the stocks in the time series of Bayesian networks based on the topological orders of the stocks in the learned Bayesian networks and develop an order distance, a new measure with which to assess the changes in the topological orders of the stocks. In an empirical study using stock data from the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we use the order distance to predict the extreme absolute return, which is a proxy of extreme market risks, or a signal of systemic risks, using the LASSO regression model. Our results indicate that the network statistics of the time series of Bayesian networks and the order distance substantially improve the predictability of extreme absolute returns and provide insights into the assessment of systemic risk.",,"This work was partially supported by the Hong Kong RGC Theme-based Research Scheme, grant number T31-604/18-N and The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology research grant “Risk Analytics and Applications” (grant number SBMDF21BM07).

Measuring the systemic risk of an individual hedge fund by using the marginal expected shortfall (MES), we find evidence for a positive and statistically significant relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns. The risk-adjusted return of a hedge fund portfolio with a high systemic risk is 0.64% per month higher than for one with a low systemic risk during 1994–2012, while negative performance is observed during crisis periods. The relation between systemic risk and hedge fund returns holds for both live and defunct funds. Moreover, the relation holds even after controlling for a large set of fund characteristics. Hence, systemic risk is a powerful determinant of cross-sectional variations in hedge fund returns. Our results imply that the positive relation between hedge fund returns and systemic risk is due to compensation for the realized losses during systemic events.",,,Journal of Empirical Finance,,Elsevier,"0927-5398, 1879-1727",,2017-06,2017,,2017-06,42,,109-130,All OA; Green,Article,"Hwang, Inchang; Xu, Simon; In, Francis; Kim, Tong Suk","Hwang, Inchang (Korea Insurance Research Institute, KFPABldg, 38 Gukjegeumyung-ro 6-gil, Youngdeungpo-gu, Seoul 07328, South Korea); Xu, Simon (Department of Banking and Finance, Monash Business School, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia); In, Francis (Department of Accounting, Finance and Economics, Griffth Business School, Griffth University, Gold Coast campus, QLD 4222, Australia); Kim, Tong Suk (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, College of Business, 85 Hoegiro, Dongdaemoon- gu, Seoul 130-722, South Korea)","In, Francis ","Hwang, Inchang (); Xu, Simon (Monash University); In, Francis (); Kim, Tong Suk (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)",Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; Monash University,grid.37172.30; grid.1002.3,Daejeon; Melbourne,; Victoria,South Korea; Australia,,,,,,7,3,,3.0,,https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/10072/339927/1/HwangPUB2701.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084087476,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

With the advent of risk-based thinking in industry, there was a need for introducing the risk culture within the organization, including maintenance, in order to reduce business losses. Analysis of equipment failures data showed a relation between the failures types with their consequences, and all interaction with system maintenance components. The ineffective maintenance system may cause multiple losses for the organization and therefore affects the whole business. This paper introduces a systemic risk management model to manage the maintenance system undesired events and control the impact on the organization and the consequences on business.

These intra-sectoral interdependencies between financial market participants have contributed to the spread of instability in the financial system. Therefore mapping these links is important for policy-makers to provide supervisory tools and can be a key input into the design of macroprudential policies. For this purpose, we adopt the Tail-Event driven NETwork (TENET) risk model. The TENET is a useful method to map the tail interconnection between the three sectors and to provide systemic risk measures that take into account the “too big to fail” and “too big to interconnected” concepts. The results suggest that each financial sector has a significant impact on the other. By comparing the contribution of each sector, we show that banks are the largest emitters of risk. However, also shadow banking firms are systemic important, given their high level of connection.

It notes that in the current context, “too big to fail” may imply systemic risks from large financial institution size, compensating economies of scale, political power, and (within narrower markets) power to set prices above competitive levels. It examines three stylized facts: the contours of the recent merger wave among financial institutions, the concomitant increase in the concentration of financial institution assets, and the impressive rise in financial institutions’ profits as a share of all U.S. corporate profits,. It argues that rising aggregate concentration of financial institutions’ assets may imply rise in the power to set above-competitive prices in individual relevant banking markets – i.e., in segments of what economists call “product characteristics space.” There is not much solid economic evidence on this last conjecture for investment banking firms, but supporting evidence from the large number of studies focusing on commercial banks is marshaled. The evidence on economies of scale is also imperfect, but it implies that breakup of the largest banks need not cause great efficiency losses.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Scherer, Frederic M.","Scherer, Frederic M.

The possibility that differences in reconstruction geometry between vein and Dacron patched sides effected restenosis outcomes was evaluated as was the value of serial common carotid wall thickness measurements in predicting restenosis. Between 1990 and 1997, 33 bilateral CEA were performed within one year on 22 men and 11 women using a greater saphenous vein patch on one side and a knitted Dacron patch on the other. Interoperative post-CEA geometry was measured. Follow-up was by duplex scans that included wall thickness measurements in the endarterectomized common carotid bulb. Over a mean follow-up of 43 months 10 (30%) Dacron patched and one (3%) vein patched CEA developed > or = 25% restenosis (p = 0.001), seven (21%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed > or = 50% restenosis (p = 0.01) and four (12%) Dacron patched and no vein patched CEA developed > or = 70% restenosis (p = 0.11). The Kaplan-Meier cumulative > or = 25% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 22% and 0% at 2 years and 41% and 5% at 5 years respectively (p = 0.002). The cumulative > or = 50% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 16% and 0% at 2 years and 34% and 0% at 5 years respectively (p = 0.003). The cumulative > or = 70% restenosis rates for Dacron and vein patched CEA were 8% and 0% at 2 years and 20% and 0% at 5 years respectively (p = 0.02). For both patients with and without recurrent stenosis the mean within patient between sides differences of the diameters of the internal carotid, internal carotid bulb, common carotid bulb, and common carotid arteries and the lengths of the internal carotid and total patch segments were not significantly different and all were less than 5%. Common carotid bulb wall thickness measured at the time of identification of the nine unilateral Dacron patched CEA restenosis was 1.5 +/-0.5 mm compared to 1.4 +/-0.4 mm (m +/-1 SD) for the contralateral vein patched CEA (p = 0.45 by paired t test). Dacron patched CEA have a significantly higher incidence of mild, moderate and severe restenosis than do saphenous vein patched CEA independent of systemic risk factors. The within patient equality of Dacron and vein patched carotid reconstruction geometry in patients with unilateral restenosis indicates that patch material is the major local risk factor, not adverse hemodynamics produced by variance in geometry.

The attractiveness of cryptocurrencies is due in part to their decentralized, peer-to-peer structure. This makes them an alternative to national currencies which are controlled by central banks. Given that these cryptocurrencies are already replacing some of the “regular” national currencies and financial products, the question then arises: should they be regulated? And if so, how? This paper draws the legal distinction between cryptocurrencies which are in fact currency and those which are securities disguised as currency. It further suggests that in cases where a token is indeed a security, regular securities regulation should apply. In all other cases anti-fraud measures should be in place in order to protect investors.

controller in a nonlinear fashion, often incorporating feedback mechanisms.
Interdependence of systems poses additional difficulties, as cross-system
connections enable malicious activity to spread between layers, increasing
systemic risk. In this paper we explore the conditions for an optimal control
of cascading failures in a system of interdependent networks. Specifically, we
study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model incorporating a control mechanism,
which affects the frequency of cascades occurring in individual layers. This
modification allows us to explore sandpile-like dynamics near the critical
state, with supercritical region corresponding to infrequent large cascades and
subcritical zone being characterized by frequent small avalanches. Topological
coupling between networks introduces dependence of control settings adopted in
respective layers, causing the control strategy of a given layer to be
influenced by choices made in other connected networks. We find that the
optimal control strategy for a layer operating in a supercritical regime is to
be coupled to a layer operating in a subcritical zone, since such condition
corresponds to reduced probability of inflicted avalanches. However this
condition describes a parasitic relation, in which only one layer benefits.
Second optimal configuration is a mutualistic one, where both layers adopt the
same control strategy. This work demonstrates that control protocols in systems
of interdependent networks need to take into account higher-order organization
of the system and cannot be designed independently, maximizing benefits only
for their individual layers.",,,arXiv,,,,,2020-04-06,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Turalska, Malgorzata; Swami, Ananthram","Turalska, Malgorzata (); Swami, Ananthram ()",,"Turalska, Malgorzata (); Swami, Ananthram ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126276675,"40 Engineering; 4007 Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics; 51 Physical Sciences",,,,,,B12 Engineering,,dims

It argues that the concept of a global stock of international liquidity, which was fundamental to the creation of the SDR, is now no longer relevant. Nonetheless, there are good reasons to satisfy part of the growing demand for international reserves with SDR allocations: (i) there are efficiency gains, as SDRs can be created at zero resource cost, and thus obviate the need for countries to run current account surpluses or engage in expensive borrowing to obtain reserves, and (ii) there would be a reduction in systemic risk, as SDRs would substitute to some extent for borrowed reserves, which are less reliable and predictable source of reserves, especially in times of crisis.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2002,2002,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Clark, Peter B.; Polak, Jacques","Clark, Peter B.

Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading a significant portion of OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital.

The book emphasizes ‘systemic risk’ as the new-found villain of the financial space and narrates how such risk can be addressed through macroprudential tools. It, thus, offers a possible solution to avoid financial crises in future and facilitates building a safer financial system globally. The book also examines major crisis management frameworks, stress testing, relevant regulatory and supervisory development, and early warning mechanism with detailed cross-country analysis.",,,,,SAGE Publications,,,2019-01-01,2019,,2019-01-01,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Mishra, Rabi N.","Mishra, Rabi N.

networks when they try to obtain loans from banks. Such secured loan can
enhance the solvency and promote the rapid growth in the economic upturn
period. However, potential systemic risk may happen within the risk binding
community. Especially, during the economic down period, the crisis may spread
in the guarantee network like a domino. Monitoring the financial status,
preventing or reducing systematic risk when crisis happens is highly concerned
by the regulatory commission and banks. We propose visual analytics approach
for loan guarantee network risk management, and consolidate the five analysis
tasks with financial experts: i) visual analytics for enterprises default risk,
whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and
developed an interface to visualize key indicators; ii) visual analytics for
high default groups, whereby a community detection based interactive approach
is presented; iii) visual analytics for high defaults pattern, whereby a motif
detection based interactive approach is described, and we adopt a Shneiderman
Mantra strategy to reduce the computation complexity. iv) visual analytics for
evolving guarantee network, whereby animation is used to help understanding the
guarantee dynamic; v) visual analytics approach and interface for default
diffusion path. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the
government and bank to monitor the default spread status. It also provides
insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systemic
financial risk. We implement the system with case studies on a real-world
guarantee network. Two financial experts are consulted with endorsement on the
developed tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual
analytics tool to explore the guarantee network risks in a systematic manner.",,,arXiv,,,,,2017-04-06,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Niu, Zhibin; Cheng, Dawei; Zhang, Liqing; Zhang, Jiawan","Niu, Zhibin (); Cheng, Dawei (); Zhang, Liqing (); Zhang, Jiawan ()",,"Niu, Zhibin (); Cheng, Dawei (); Zhang, Liqing (); Zhang, Jiawan ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,2.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1118815232,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4607 Graphics, Augmented Reality and Games",Prevention,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth,dims

In the context of insurance, social networks, and telecommunication, risk factors often tend to be heavy-tailed and thus frequently studied under the paradigm of regular variation. We show that regular variation on different subspaces of the Euclidean space leads to these risk measures exhibiting distinct asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, we elicit connections between regular variation on these subspaces and the behavior of tail copula parameters extending previous work and providing a broad framework for studying such risk measures under multivariate regular variation.

Atherosclerosis is a progressive fibroinflammatory disease identified by intimal thickening, the focal accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and cellular elements within the walls of large arteries. These lesions preferentially develop at arterial branches, the outer walls of bifurcations, and the inner walls of curved sections; the cause of this focal vasculopathy is not fully understood. It is, however, understood from epidemiological and clinical studies that individual susceptibility to the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions is influenced by “traditional” systemic risk factors, including smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol. However, these risk factors cannot account for half of the variability in occurrence of this disease; this indicates additional risk factors have not been identified. One prevalent explanation of the focal nature of the disease is that the local fluid mechanical stresses at the walls of coronary arteries, as well as mechanical stresses within the vessel wall, may mediate the phenotype of endothelial cells thereby producing atherosusceptible sites. Therefore, it has been speculated [1] that certain aspects of arterial geometry and motion, which vary substantially among individuals, may increase an individual’s susceptibility to developing atherosclerosis — “geometric risk factors”.Copyright © 2008 by ASME",,,,"ASME 2008 Summer Bioengineering Conference, Parts A and B",ASME International,,,2008-06-25,2008,2014-03-13,2008-06-25,,,25-26,Closed,Proceeding,"Long, David S.; Zhu, Hui; Friedman, Morton H.","Long, David S.

If this is true, oil companies should strive to achieve an environmentally correct image, especially by adhering to sustainability indexes in the capital market. If not, oil companies' stock prices are still not affected by sustainability indexes. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact on the market value of a chosen group of oil companies that adhered to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI World). It evaluates the variations in three indicators: a) the systemic risk of the chosen companies (beta), b) the sensitivity of their stock prices in relation to variations in crude oil prices, and c) the conditional variance of their stock prices (volatility). Findings of our analysis indicate that the betas of only two of the firms declined due to participation in the DJSI, and there was no change in volatility or association with the oil price for any of the firms. Therefore, there is still no consolidated positive impact – or at least not a statistically proven one – between adoption of a proactive environmental posture by oil companies, reflected by adhesion to the DJSI, and their stock prices.","We wish to thank Petrobras and the Brazilian research funding agencies CNPq, FAPERJ and CAPES for providing funds for this study.",,Energy,,Elsevier,"0360-5442, 1873-6785",,2012-09,2012,,2012-09,45,1,933-943,Closed,Article,"Schaeffer, Roberto; Borba, Bruno S.M.C.; Rathmann, Régis; Szklo, Alexandre; Branco, David A.

The process of securitization is a financial innovation, which some financial analysts consider one of the causes of the Great Financial Crisis. Although it is often linked to the emergence of the Great Financial Crisis, the advantages of the securitization model, together with a level of adaptability and enhanced process control throughout all procedural levels, significantly outweigh its perceived shortcomings. The financial system of the Republic of Srpska continues to be characterized by the growth of nonperforming loans in bank assets, mainly caused by increased systemic risk due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and declining economic activity in the country, but also by a well-developed financial system infrastructure, which is necessary in order to allow the application of the securitization model to significantly contribute to increasing financial stability in the conditions of volatile financial structure. The model of securitization of nonperforming loans and its application in the process of bank restructuring can be the mainstay of the stabilization of the financial system. The aim of the research is to demonstrate that the application of the adapted securitization model of nonperforming assets of banks and its application in the process of bank restructuring in the conditions of unstable financial structure may contribute to financial stability and control of increase of a systemic risk. Securitization increases the supply of quality financial instruments, the number of participants in the process of transformation of financial assets and develops a more resilient financial market. The results include emergence of additional funding sources for financial institutions, generation of nonperforming assets’ problems, with additional liquidity and diversification for many of their clients.",,,ECONOMICS,,De Gruyter,2303-5013,,2021-06-01,2021,2021-06-04,2021-06-01,9,1,205-219,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bašić, Dragana; Ćurić, Predrag","Bašić, Dragana (University of Banja Luka, Faculty of Economics, Banja Luka, Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina); Ćurić, Predrag (NLB Bank a.d.

Employing discourse and network analysis on samples of the most cited scholarly works on banking regulation as well as on systemic risk (60 sources each) from 1985 to 2014, we analyze the shift from micro to macro-prudential thinking in the shift to the post crisis period. Our analysis demonstrates that the predominance of formalism, particularly, partial equilibrium analysis along with the exclusion of historical and practitioners’ styles of reasoning from banking regulatory studies impeded economists from engaging seriously with the endogenous sources of systemic risk prior to the crisis. Post-crisis, these topics became important in this discourse, but the epistemological failures of banking regulatory studies pre-crisis were not sufficiently recognized. Recent attempts to conceptualize and price systemic risk as a negative externality point to the persistence of formalism and equilibrium thinking, with its attending dangers of incremental innovation due to epistemological barriers constrains theoretical progress, by excluding observed phenomena, which cannot yet be accommodated in mathematical models.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Thiemann, Matthias; Aldegwy, Mohamed; Ibrocevic, Edin","Thiemann, Matthias (Goethe University Frankfurt); Aldegwy, Mohamed (Goethe University Frankfurt, House of Finance, Students); Ibrocevic, Edin (Goethe University Frankfurt, Students)",,"Thiemann, Matthias (Goethe University Frankfurt); Aldegwy, Mohamed (Goethe University Frankfurt); Ibrocevic, Edin (Goethe University Frankfurt)",Goethe University Frankfurt,grid.7839.5,Frankfurt am Main,Hessen,Germany,,,,,,1,0,,0.41,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/140894/1/859626644.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102461185,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The geometric analysis of the time series of cross-country liabilities shows that the systematic information of the interbank international market is contained in a space of small dimension. Geometric spaces of financial relations across countries are developed, for which the space volume, multivariate skewness and multivariate kurtosis are computed. The behavior of these coefficients reveals an important modification acting in the financial linkages since 1997 and allows us to relate the shape of the geometric space that emerges in recent years to the globally turbulent period that has characterized financial systems since the late 1990s. Here we show that, besides a persistent decrease in the volume of the geometric space since 1997, the observation of a generalized increase in the values of the multivariate skewness and kurtosis sheds some light on the behavior of cross-border interdependencies during periods of financial crises. This was found to occur in such a systematic fashion, that these coefficients may be used as a proxy for systemic risk.","This work has benefited from partial financial support from the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia-FCT, under the 13 Multi-annual Funding Project of UECE, Technical University of Lisbon.",,Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,,Elsevier,"0378-4371, 1873-2119",,2014-01,2014,,2014-01,394,,277-287,All OA; Green,Article,"Araújo, Tanya; Spelta, Alessandro","Araújo, Tanya (ISEG - Technical University of Lisbon (TULisbon), Portugal; Research Unit on Complexity in Economics (UECE), Portugal); Spelta, Alessandro (University of Pavia, Italy)","Araújo, Tanya (University of Lisbon; )","Araújo, Tanya (University of Lisbon); Spelta, Alessandro (University of Pavia)",University of Lisbon; University of Pavia,grid.9983.b; grid.8982.b,Lisbon; Pavia,Lisboa; ,Portugal; Italy,Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia,cOAlition S,Portugal,,,3,0,,1.41,,http://dem-web.unipv.it/web/docs/dipeco/quad/ps/RePEc/pav/demwpp/DEMWP0050.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051931695,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4902 Mathematical Physics,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

DESIGN: Literature review.
METHODS: A subset of papers published in the peer-reviewed literature were selected.
RESULTS: Major innovations in retina include: (1) advances in the treatment of diabetic macular edema, including the use of aflibercept and sustained delivery dexamethasone intravitreal implants as well as subthreshold micropulse diode laser therapy; (2) reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein, and zeaxanthin supplements as reported in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study-2; (3) use of enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography for choroidal imaging; (4) use of gene therapy to treat choroideremia; (5) use of combination pharmacotherapy (i.e., squalamine + ranibizumab) and gene therapy to treat the neovascular complications of AMD; and (6) use of stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium transplants to treat atrophic AMD and Stargardt macular dystrophy. In addition, we review the ocular and systemic risks associated with sustained intraocular steroid delivery and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways. We also review potential applications of gene- versus cell-based therapy for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Several treatment approaches are effective in the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Prophylaxis against AMD progression with Age-Related Eye Disease Study-2 supplements seems to reduce the risk of developing neovascular but not atrophic complications of AMD. Enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography data provide new information on the role of the choroid in a variety of conditions.

We compute the index for 10 European countries, exploiting the information incorporated in the CDS premia of 44 large banks over the period January 2007–September 2010. In this way, we provide a market based measure of the liability incurred by the Governments, due to the implicit bail-out guarantees they provide to the financial sector. We find that during the financial crisis the systemic component of the default risk in the banking sector has significantly increased in all countries, with the exception of Germany and the Netherlands. As a consequence, the Governments' liability implicit in the bail out guarantee amounts to a quite relevant share of GDP in several countries: it is huge for Ireland, lower but still important for the other PIIGS (Italy is the least affected within this group) and for the UK. Finally, our estimate is very close to the overall amount of money already committed in the rescue plans adopted in Europe between October 2008 and March 2010, despite strong cross-country differences: in particular, Germany and Ireland seem to have committed an amount of resources much larger than needed; to the contrary, the Italian Government has committed much less than it should.",,,Journal of International Money and Finance,,Elsevier,"0261-5606, 1873-0639",,2013-02,2013,,2013-02,32,,990-1007,Closed,Article,"Baglioni, Angelo; Cherubini, Umberto","Baglioni, Angelo (Catholic University of Milan, Largo Gemelli, n. 1, 20123 Milano, Italy); Cherubini, Umberto (University of Bologna, Italy)","Baglioni, Angelo (Catholic University of the Sacred Heart)","Baglioni, Angelo (Catholic University of the Sacred Heart); Cherubini, Umberto (University of Bologna)",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Bologna,grid.8142.f; grid.6292.f,Milan; Bologna,Lombardia; Emilia-Romagna,Italy; Italy,,,,,,11,1,,3.84,4.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008519660,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This paper models systemic risk by tapping into expert knowledge of financial supervisors. We decompose systemic risk into a number of interconnected segments, for which the level of vulnerability is measured. The system is modeled in the form of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), in which nodes represent vulnerability in segments and links their interconnectedness. A main problem tackled in this paper is the aggregation of values in different interrelated nodes of the map to obtain an estimate of systemic risk. To this end, Choquet integral-based aggregation is employed to expert evaluations of measures, as it allows for the integration of interrelations among factors in the aggregation process. The approach is illustrated through two applications in a European setting. First, we provide an estimation of systemic risk with a Pan-European set-up. Second, we estimate country-level risks, allowing for a more granular decomposition. This sets a starting point for the use of the rich, oftentimes tacit, knowledge in policy organizations.",,,Decision Support Systems,,Elsevier,"0167-9236, 1873-5797",,2016-08,2016,,2016-08,88,,38-50,Closed,Article,"Mezei, József; Sarlin, Peter","Mezei, József (RiskLab Finland at Arcada University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland; IAMSR, Faculty of Social Sciences, Business, and Economics, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland); Sarlin, Peter (Department of Economics, Hanken School of Economics, Helsinki, Finland; RiskLab Finland at Arcada University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki, Finland)","Sarlin, Peter (Hanken School of Economics; Arcada University of Applied Sciences)","Mezei, József (Arcada University of Applied Sciences; Åbo Akademi University); Sarlin, Peter (Hanken School of Economics; Arcada University of Applied Sciences)",Arcada University of Applied Sciences; Hanken School of Economics; Åbo Akademi University,grid.445595.c; grid.445604.7; grid.13797.3b,Helsinki; Helsinki; Turku,; ; ,Finland; Finland; Finland,,,,,,18,4,,4.75,5.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035833045,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This Article argues that if virtual currencies are used at that scale, it would pose threats to the stability of the financial system – threats that have been largely unexplored to date. Such threats will arise because the ability of a virtual currency to function as money is very fragile – Bitcoin can remain money only for so long as people have confidence that bitcoins will be readily accepted by others as a means of payment. Unlike the U.S. dollar, which is backed by both a national government and a central bank, and the euro, which is at least backed by a central bank, there is no institution that can shore up confidence in Bitcoin (or any other virtual currency) in the event of a panic. This Article explores some regulatory measures that could help address the systemic risks posed by virtual currencies, but argues that the best way to contain those risks is for regulated institutions to outcompete virtual currencies by offering better payment services, thus consigning virtual currencies to a niche role in the economy. This Article therefore concludes by exploring how the distributed ledger technology pioneered by Bitcoin could be adapted to allow regulated entities to provide vastly more efficient payment services for sovereign currency-denominated transactions, while at the same time seeking to avoid concentrating the provision of those payment services within “too big to fail” banks. .",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Allen, Hilary J.","Allen, Hilary J.

For many years it has been recognized that disturbed local hemodynamics, including low and reversed flow, primarily at branch points and at the inner surfaces of curved arterial segments, plays an important role in determining the distribution of atherosclerotic plaque. As part of an effort to create a new instrument for intracoronary flow imaging, the authors have used computational fluid dynamics to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for blood flow in realistically curved models of coronary arteries with various degrees of stenosis. The results demonstrate important effects of coronary artery curvature on intracoronary flow characteristics and demonstrate the feasibility of using these techniques for in vivo intracoronary flow imaging.<>",,,,Proceedings of Computers in Cardiology Conference,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,,1993,1993,,,,,775-777,Closed,Proceeding,"Feldman, C.L.; Fernandes, J.S.; Stone, P.H.","Feldman, C.L.

This study uses the SWOT analytical model to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in China’s oil sector, and the changes in opportunities and threats caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has brought multiple impacts to China’s oil security. Results from the analysis show that the existing opportunities such as oil investments in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and domestic upstream opening-up have been weakened; new threats that the uncertainty over global oil demand-supply and decrease in global upstream investments have emerged; opportunities that an increase in domestic strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) and low-carbon development are rising amid the pandemic.

287,pub.1102464132,10.2139/ssrn.2817911,,,,"Fault Lines: Earthquakes, Insurance, and Systemic Financial Risk","The fault lines from a major earthquake in Canada could quickly spread through the insurance industry and have a systemic financial impact. Policymakers should take several steps now to avert this chain of events. Since the financial crisis of 2007/08, policymakers have focused on systemic risk to financial and economic systems, with most of the attention on the banking system. The framework for these efforts has been to build resiliency and shock absorbers to minimize the impact of financial shocks on the real economy. The inevitability of an earthquake in Canada poses a similar systemic financial risk for the insurance industry and the economy as a whole, and similar remedial efforts are required. A federal emergency backstop arrangement for property and casualty insurers, properly designed, would minimize the systemic financial impact resulting from such a catastrophic and likely uninsurable event on those affected and on the economy at large. The moral-hazard implications appear small compared to the benefits of avoiding serious systemic risk. The backstop arrangement should, however, apportion costs, including a possible tranche of further contingent risk-sharing with industry in a way that lessens moral hazard issues. A federal last-resort backstop guarantee could kick in beyond an industry-wide trigger of expected losses, say those associated with a one-in-500-year earthquake – currently approximately $30 billion to $35 billion. This loss estimate would be updated periodically, and the trigger could be set somewhere in excess of the one-in-500 threshold to promote further industry risk-sharing. That said, as part of any Canadian reform package, it is important to bolster the Property and Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation to deal with insurance industry problems and reduce systemic impacts from severe catastrophes. This would also reduce the likelihood that a federal financial commitment would be triggered and, if triggered, would have minimum costs. Having more tools available in advance to deal with catastrophic events would reduce post-catastrophe disaster claims. This Commentary recommends the following: • Strengthen PACCIC so it can intervene before insurance companies in financial difficulty become insolvent. • Ensure PACCIC has the capability to borrow to reduce its liquidity needs in a crisis. • Following these structural changes, PACCIC should rerun its scenario models to examine how much that could increase resilience to extreme events. Furthermore, insurance industry bodies, as well as the federal and provincial governments, should undertake awareness programs to enhance homeowners’ understanding of catastrophe risks. This should encourage Canadians to evaluate the merits of disaster insurance coverage, particularly in the Quebec City-Montreal-Ottawa corridor where such insurance penetration is far too low. Finally, the insurance industry, under active OSFI supervision, should further develop its models for setting aside adequate capital and claims-paying capacity. Regulators should ensure there is an adequate degree of conservatism and that models are as up to date as possible. OSFI should regularly assess the adequacy of major insurers’ models, as they have done in the banking industry.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Le Pan, Nicholas","Le Pan, Nicholas (C.D.

However, while cryptocurrency is kept in smart contracts, such as being paid to a blockchain service, no extra profit is generated. The time value of cryptocurrency serves only as collateral, which is an issue of capital inefficiency. Therefore, we propose to maximize the time value of cryptocurrency in smart contracts by supplying it to decentralized money markets of Compound to earn supply interest. Furthermore, by utilizing the interest generated, we can mitigate the liquidity risk of Compound and thus do not diminish the flexibility of the original service much. Experiments are conducted to testify the proposed method, and the implementation cost is estimated to be 2.1 US dollars. We also discuss the potential systemic risk in the decentralized finance system.","This work was supported by the Center for Open Intelligent Connectivity through the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the Framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan.

In this work, we study efficient immunization strategies to prevent a default contagion that might occur in a financial network. An essential difference from the previous studies on immunization strategy is that we take into account the possibility of serious side effects. Uniform immunization refers to a situation in which banks are “vaccinated” with a common low-risk asset. The riskiness of immunized banks will decrease significantly, but the level of systemic risk may increase due to the de-diversification effect. To overcome this side effect, we propose another immunization strategy, called counteractive immunization, which prevents pairs of banks from failing simultaneously. We find that counteractive immunization can efficiently reduce systemic risk without altering the riskiness of individual banks.",Kobayashi gratefully acknowledges financial support from KAKENHI 25780203 and 24243044.,,Scientific Reports,,Springer Nature,2045-2322,"Computer Simulation; Economic Recession; Financial Management; Humans; Models, Economic; Risk Sharing, Financial",2014-01-23,2014,2014-01-23,,4,1,3834,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kobayashi, Teruyoshi; Hasui, Kohei","Kobayashi, Teruyoshi (Graduate School of Economics, Kobe University, 2-1 Rokkodai, 657-8501, Nada, Kobe, Japan); Hasui, Kohei (Graduate School of Economics, Kobe University, 2-1 Rokkodai, 657-8501, Nada, Kobe, Japan)",,"Kobayashi, Teruyoshi (Kobe University); Hasui, Kohei (Kobe University)",Kobe University,grid.31432.37,Kobe,,Japan,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,,Japan,grant.6126606; grant.6083903,25780203; 24243044,22,4,0.22,8.01,1.0,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03834.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041874688,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Immunization; Prevention; Vaccine Related,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,3 Good Health and Well Being,dims

Our model represents an extension of clearing models of interdependent liabilities to account for the presence of uncertainty on banks' external assets. At the same time, it also provides a natural extension of classic structural credit risk models to the case of an interconnected system. We characterize the existence and uniqueness of a valuation that maximizes individual and total equity values for all banks. We apply our model to the assessment of systemic risk and in particular for the case of stress testing. Further, we provide a fixed‐point algorithm to carry out the network valuation and the conditions for its convergence.","All authors contributed to the concept of the study.

Economic policy making powers at the euro-area level differ significantly from those in fully-fledged federations. In particular, while fiscal policy is formulated in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact, virtually all fiscal competencies remain at the national level according to the principle of subsidiarity. By contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) sets monetary policy for the area as a whole. This new framework raises the issue of co-ordination of policies at the euroarea level. It also raises issues regarding the future relations of the Economic Monetary Union (EMU) with countries outside the area. In this respect, this paper addresses the following two questions:
What are the risks that the new institutional arrangements put in place in the euro area may generate more unbalanced policies — or make it more difficult to conduct stabilisation policies — than earlier, creating negative international spillovers?And related to this, does the new framework imply systemic risks for the functioning of international financial markets?",,,,Challenges for Economic Policy Coordination within European Monetary Union,Springer Nature,,,2001,2001,,2001,,,201-205,Closed,Chapter,"Durand, Martine","Durand, Martine (Economics Department, Organisation for Economic and Co-operation Development (OECD), 2, André Pascal, 75775, Paris Cedex 16, France)",,"Durand, Martine (Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development)",Organisation For Economic Co-Operation and Development,grid.36193.3e,Paris,,France,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023855579,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,,Generic health relevance,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

A Component Expected Shortfall approach to systemic risk,"This paper proposes a component approach to systemic risk which allows to decompose the risk of the aggregate financial system (measured by Expected Shortfall) while accounting for the firm characteristics. Developed by analogy with the Component Value-at-Risk concept, our new systemic risk measure, called Component ES, presents several advantages. It is a hybrid measure, which combines the Too Interconnected To Fail and the Too Big To Fail logics. CES relies only on publicly available daily data and encompasses the popular Marginal ES measure. CES can be used to assess the contribution of a firm to systemic risk at a precise date but also to forecast its contribution over a certain period. The empirical application verifies the ability of CES to identify the most systemically risky firms during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. We show that our measure identifies the institutions labeled as SIFIs by the Financial Stability Board.","The authors thank the editor as well as two anonymous referees for useful comments on the earlier version of the paper.

Among the key components of financial stability highlighted by the central banks of the countries and which, using the tools of macro-prudential regulation, ensure the financial stability of the banking system, a special place is given to the ability of the latter to smoothly perform its functions. The effectiveness of such implementation is determined to be the prior condition for such operational continuity. For this purpose, methodical support is proposed for revising the functionality of Ukrainian state banks in terms of their efficiency, determined by the DEA model (Data Envelopment Analysis) with input parameters of customer funds, operating expenses, reserves for credit risks, and output parameters of interest income. The calculations of the performance indicators of state banks by the DEA model were made using DEAOS (Data Envelopment Analysis Online Software). The values of the efficiency indicator were calculated, the ranking of banks was conducted, and the optimal values of input and output parameters for inefficient banks were given. Recommendations were made to improve the efficiency of their activities: balancing the volume of customer funds with the volume of active operations; reducing operating expenses and reserves for credit risks by increasing the quality of loan portfolios. In conclusion, by using the DEA model it is possible not only to determine the measure of the efficiency of state-owned banks in the financial market, but also to make management decisions regarding the adjustment of the main indicators of their activities. This, ultimately, will contribute to raising the level of financial stability not only of state banks, but also of the entire banking system of Ukraine.",,,Bulletin of V N Karazin Kharkiv National University Economic Series,,V.

Basel Committee (BIS) has introduced a set of regulations to identify such banks, defined global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the robustness of the BIS's methodology.   Design/methodology/approach In this study, a multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) approach is considered, specifically HSMAA (hierarchy stochastic multiobjective acceptability analysis), which can take into account uncertainty on BIS's criteria weights as standard SMAA, but also uncertainty with respect to the subcriteria of the considered criteria. The results are analyzed to provide insights into the robustness of the BIS's methodology.   Findings The obtained results indicate that overall the BIS's methodology does not appear robust. Within the two uncertainty scenarios considered, the results show a great variability in identifying the G-SIBs' systemic risk.   Originality/value The paper proposes an analytical way to assess the robustness of the BIS's methodology. Moreover, the authors’ analysis reveals a great variability on the results, which highlight different issues for banks, regulators and enterprises.","The authors would like to thank the Editor Fernando A.F.

This paper traces how central bank economists forged an analytical apparatus that could guide and legitimize such central bank interventions, detailing how their work involved forging new connections between actors within the boundary zone between the academic and the bureaucratic fields. Acting as ‘economists in the wild’, I show how these actors were able to establish ‘stylized facts’ about the boom-and-bust cycles of financial markets. Holding a foot both within the academic and the bureaucratic fields, such boundary walkers skilfully leveraged central bank resources to enrol allies in the field of academic economics to decisively shift the discursive representation of finance as cyclical, in turn legitimating ambitious central bank interventions into the functioning of the economy.","I thank Edin Ibrocevic, Jan Friedrich and especially Marius Birk for their excellent research assistance on this paper.

The antidote, regulatory diversity, would correspond to the strategy of re-politicisation of financial market regulation, and democratic steering of regulatory agencies, displacing the currently dominant notion of financial market regulation as a purely technical, expert, ‘insider’ discourse. If it is too much of a paradox for policy-makers and market participants that international cooperation in pursuit of global stability must include making space for some regulatory diversity, then we may expect re-plays of recent stressful events.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2009,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dorn, Nicholas","Dorn, Nicholas (Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London)",,"Dorn, Nicholas ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102274822,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science",,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

At present, quantitative research on the macroprudential regulation for the dynamic Chinese banking network system is lacking, while the related studies in other countries have not considered the interbank network structure. Therefore, in the present paper, we construct a dynamic banking network model with a scale-free network and a dynamic macroprudential regulation model under four risk allocation mechanisms (CVaR, Incremental VaR, Shapley value EL, and ΔCoVaR) for the dynamic Chinese banking network system. Then, we conduct empirical research to study the effect of the macroprudential regulation model on the Chinese banking network system. Our results show that the Chinese banking network system was the most unstable in 2010 and that the average default probability decreased every year after the macroprudential regulation, indicating the effectiveness of the macroprudential regulation model. From the perspective of the scale-free network structure, we find that the intrinsic mechanism of macroprudential regulation is to rewire the interbank linkages from small banks to large banks with more interbank lending to prevent contagious risk, thereby improving the stability of the entire banking system. Moreover, the regulation effects of ΔCoVaR and CVaR mechanisms are found to be better than those of the other mechanisms. The regulation effect of ΔCoVaR is the most significant.",We acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71371046 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (19D110803).,,Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination,,Springer Nature,"1860-711X, 1860-7128",,2019-03-20,2019,2019-03-20,2020-07,15,3,579-611,Closed,Article,"Gao, Qianqian; Fan, Hong","Gao, Qianqian (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, 200051, Shanghai, China); Fan, Hong (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, 200051, Shanghai, China)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University)","Gao, Qianqian (Donghua University); Fan, Hong (Donghua University)",Donghua University,grid.255169.c,Shanghai,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8319441,71371046,3,3,,1.83,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112895872,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Using data on China’s stock market from January 5, 2007 to September 28, 2018, this study calculated three different measures of systemic risk, i.e., temporal fluctuation of financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk (CoVaR), sensitivity of financial institutions to systemic risk (MES) and long-run expected capital shortfall (SRISK), to assess the formation, occurrence, and consequences of systemic risk in China. The results show that CoVaR and MES exhibited an abnormal rise during the outbreak of the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2015 domestic stock market crash, whereas SRISK showed a steady increase throughout the observation window, indicating China’s ever-growing SRISK despite the CoVaR and MES. More importantly, regardless of temporal fluctuation, (1) the vast majority of systemic risk comes from banks, followed by insurance firms, which is shown by the institutions’ ranking in terms of CoVaR; (2) securities firms followed by insurance firms are exposed to more systemic risk as indicated by short-run expected equity loss (i.e., MES); and (3) banks accumulate more SRISK than any other financial institution. The findings suggest that, in the event of a severe Chinese financial crisis, likely banks will endure the greatest amount of capital shortfall, whereas securities firms will suffer more short-run loss proportionally and thus risk a higher probability of bankruptcy.

This essay examines the principal differences between an economy with a well-developed corporate bond market free from government interference and an economy in which bank financing plays a central role (as in East Asia). When a full-fledged corporate bond market is present, market forces have a much greater opportunity to assert themselves, thereby reducing systemic risk and the probability of a crisis. This is because such an environment is associated with greater accounting transparency, a large community of financial analysts, respected rating agencies, a wide range of corporate debt securities and derivatives demanding sophisticated credit analysis, and efficient procedures for corporate reorganization and liquidation. In addition, the richness of available securities will tend to enhance economic welfare, and the market forces at work on the wide array of bond prices are likely to have a strong spillover effect on the health of the banking system as well.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,1999,1999,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hakansson, Nils H.","Hakansson, Nils H.

We find that a bank’s systemic risk level is a possible reason for CoCo issuance. Contrary to the pecking order theory, earnings management practices play a lesser role, and there is no evidence of banks becoming riskier after issuing CoCos. However, we find systemically riskier banks are more likely to issue CoCos. Thus, riskier banks may be utilising CoCo loss absorption mechanisms to partially internalise the costs of future loan losses. If banks are issuing such instruments without regulatory prompting, then an issuance may signal the need to provide greater oversight. Conversely, if such issuances do result from regulatory prompting, then banks may be engaging in risk management strategies, minimising their cost of equity issuance.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Williams, Barry; Tan, Shao Lei; Fenech, Jean-Pierre","Williams, Barry (Department of Banking and Finance; Financial Research Network (FIRN)); Tan, Shao Lei (Monash University - Department of Banking and Finance); Fenech, Jean-Pierre (Monash University; Financial Research Network (FIRN))",,"Williams, Barry (); Tan, Shao Lei (Monash University); Fenech, Jean-Pierre ()",Monash University,grid.1002.3,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia,,,,,,4,1,,1.92,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105028738,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

This study uses financial distress as a moderating variable to examine the relationship between financial immunity and stock returns of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which have different characteristics. The research samples were companies listed on the Indonesia stock exchange and the Shanghai stock exchange with 767 and 736 observations, respectively, in 2016-2019. The first-stage test method uses balanced data panel regression to test individual interactions as a sufficient condition. Regression model specification of the response variable for the fixed effects model can overcome the common effects model limitations. The second stage is a matched test or Paired Samples T-Test for hypothesis testing after testing each individual interaction for each country. The results of this study show that financial immunity has a positive effect on stock returns in two countries: Indonesia and China. Meanwhile, the financial distress of the US-China Trade War for Indonesia and Shanghai shows different results. Financial distress significantly reduces stock returns on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, while the distress does not affect stock returns on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Staaten sahen sich in Durchbrechung marktwirtschaftlicher Prinzipien zur Rettung von Banken gezwungen, deren Insolvenz die Stabilität des Finanzsystems hätte gefährden können. Der Wettbewerb kann bei einer so massiven Staatsintervention seine Auslese- und Allokationsfunktionen nicht mehr erfüllen. Reformüberlegungen müssen darauf gerichtet sein, Situationen vorzubeugen, in denen Staaten sich erneut zur Rettung von Finanzinstituten gezwungen sehen. Ein Lösungsansatz besteht darin, durch rechtliche Gestaltung die bedrohlichen Wirkungen von Bankenkrisen und -insolvenzen für das Finanzsystem, das sog. systemische Risiko, zu mindern. Der Beitrag diskutiert vor diesem Hintergrund drei Ansätze der Risikominderung und -vorsorge: die Einführung sog. „Bankentestamente“, Modifikationen des Close-out-Netting und das Clearing über sog. Central Counterparties (CCPs). Throughout the world, the financial crisis has led to state intervention on a scale that would have been almost unimaginable before. Laying aside market economy principles, governments were forced to rescue banks whose insolvency could have put the stability of the financial system in jeopardy. Amid such massive state intervention, competition is no longer able to perform its selection and allocation function. Reform concepts have to be aimed at avoiding situations in which governments see themselves once again forced to rescue financial institutions. One possible approach consists in providing a legal framework in which the adverse effects of banking crises and insolvencies – or systemic risk – are reduced. In this context the paper discusses three approaches of risk reduction and prevention: the introduction of „living wills“ for banks, modifications to close-out netting and clearing through central counterparties (CCPs).",,,Zeitschrift für Unternehmens- und Gesellschaftsrecht,,De Gruyter,"0340-2479, 1612-7048",,2010-07-01,2010,2010-08-05,2010-07-01,39,4,597-661,Closed,Article,"Zimmer, Daniel; Fuchs, Florian","Zimmer, Daniel (Mitglied der Monopolkommission, ist Direktor, Law and Economics (CASTLE) der Universität Bonn); Fuchs, Florian (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter des Center for Advanced Studies in Law and Economics (CASTLE) der Universität Bonn)",,"Zimmer, Daniel (University of Bonn); Fuchs, Florian (University of Bonn)",University of Bonn,grid.10388.32,Bonn,,Germany,,,,,,1,0,,1.02,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003456989,36 Creative Arts and Writing; 3605 Screen and Digital Media,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

These risks are part of a special category of intersystemic systemic risks, which are 'compound' in nature: they possess the potential to cascade across different systems and entail a liability to exponential growth across numbers of linked systems. Moreover, climate change and zoonotic disease risks are globalised, ubiquitous and entrenched. Effective governance of intersystemic systemic risks demands proactive regulatory intervention at the early stages of risk creation, and reliance on a more balanced basket of regulatory measures than is currently available. For climate change as well as zoonotic disease risk control, this calls for greater investment in assessment requirements, a less permissive approach to planning and development consent, and a commitment to phase out unsustainable production processes.",,,Modern Law Review,,Wiley,"0026-7961, 1468-2230",,2022-03-04,2022,2022-03-04,2022-07,85,4,938-967,All OA; Green,Article,"Heyvaert, Veerle","Heyvaert, Veerle (V.Heyvaert@lse.ac.uk)","Heyvaert, Veerle ","Heyvaert, Veerle ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,7.0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111326,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146038503,48 Law and Legal Studies,Prevention,,,,,C18 Law,13 Climate Action,dims

Much of this attention has focused on counterparty risk in the over-the-counter market, where trades are bilaterally executed between dealers and derivative purchasers. One proposal for addressing such counterparty risk is to mandate the trading of derivatives over a centralized clearinghouse. This paper lays out the advantages and risks to a mandated clearing requirement, showing how, in some instances, such a mandate can actually increase systemic risk and result in more financial bailouts. This paper also describes the dynamics of counterparty risk in the derivatives market. Discussing the relative importance of both the risk that arises from the price risk of the instrument at issue and the financial condition of the counterparty. The analysis then turns to an evaluation of how bilateral markets and clearinghouses manage these two risks.

Under the SVaR metric, the contribution of individual banks to systemic risk is well defined and can be approximated by a Shapley value-type measure. We show that, in a SVaR regime, a fair systemic risk charge which is proportional to a bank's individual contribution to systemic risk diverges from the optimal macroprudential capitalization of the banks from a planner's perspective.

However, only recently have they tied judicial independence with the rule of law.

As for the ECtHR, some individual complaints arising from measures adopted by states signatories of the ECHR where there are systemic deficiencies in the rule of law related to judicial independence have resulted in interesting decisions. Nevertheless, the ECtHR’s individual right-oriented approach, and the fact that judicial review is implemented by means of individual complaints, narrow the ECtHR’s scope of action to tackle potential systemic risks entailed by the violations of judicial independence. In any case, the protection of judicial independence as an inherent element of the rule of law should not be dealt with in comparative terms, but rather in terms of cooperation. To this date, the contributions of both courts have proven the importance of the judicial dimension to counter the threats to the independence of the judiciary.",,,,Fundamental Rights Challenges,Springer Nature,,,2021-06-18,2021,2021-06-18,2021,,,167-187,Closed,Chapter,"Andrés Sáenz de Santa María, Paz","Andrés Sáenz de Santa María, Paz (School of Law, Universidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain)","Andrés Sáenz de Santa María, Paz (University of Oviedo)","Andrés Sáenz de Santa María, Paz (University of Oviedo)",University of Oviedo,grid.10863.3c,Oviedo,,Spain,"Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness",,Spain,,,1,1,,4.13,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138949738,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law; 4807 Public Law,,,,,,C18 Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims
284,pub.1102276781,10.2139/ssrn.1522544,,,,Chaos and Bifurcation in 2007-08 Financial Crisis,"The impact of increasing leverage in the economy produces hyperreaction of market participants to variations of their revenues. If the income of banks decreases, they mass-reduce their lendings; if corporations sales drop, and due to existing debt they cannot adjust their liquidities by further borrowings, then they must immediately reduce their expenses, lay off staff, and cancel investments. This hyperreaction produces a bifurcation mechanism, and eventually a strong dynamical instability in capital markets, commonly called systemic risk. In this article, we show that this instability can be monitored by measuring the highest eigenvalue of a matrix of elasticities. These elasticities measure the reaction of each sector of the economy to a drop in its revenues from another sector. This highest eigenvalue - also called the spectral radius - of the elasticity matrix, can be used as an early indicator of market instability and potential crisis. Grandmont [85] and subsequent research showed the possibility that the ""invisible hand"" of markets become chaotic, opening the door to uncontrolled swings. Our contribution is to provide an actual way of measuring how close to chaos the market is. Estimating elasticities and actually generating the indicators of instability will be the topic of forthcoming research.

The objective of this study is to understand the evolution of systemic risk in dual-banking systems and determine whether there are any differences in the systemic risk profiles of conventional and Islamic banks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also identifies the determinants of systemic importance (measured using spillover indices) of financial institutions. The sample includes ten countries where the Islamic banking sector is considered systemically important and covers the period from November 2015 to November 2020. The empirical results indicate a significant increase in systemic risk, in the sample countries, during the first half which is followed by a recovery in the second half of 2020. Comparative analysis shows that Islamic banks have similar systemic vulnerabilities to systematic and idiosyncratic factors during the exogenously induced real economic shock of the COVID-19. However, Islamic banks pose significantly less spillover to others relative to conventional banks while earning abnormal returns. The results are robust to the inclusion of macroeconomic factors and alternate estimation methodologies. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for the regulators of dual-banking systems.",We are thankful to Dr. Barbara L&#x27; Huillier for her helpful comments and suggestions that enabled us to improve the quality of this paper considerably.

Gingival overgrowth (GO) is a manifestation of exaggerated inflammatory response of the gingivae in response to biofilm and varying local and systemic risk factors which include medications such as antihypertentive medication- nifedipine. A patient with multiple dental care needs with GO, complicated by systemic risk factors would invariably benefit from multidisciplinary approach for care. A 57-year-old female was diagnosed with chronic periodontitis, nifedipine-induced GO and metabolic syndrome. Management encompassed initial nonsurgical periodontal therapy, where the patient was educated and guided towards better plaque control, following which, scaling, root debridement, and surgical therapy (gingivectomy and excisional new attachment procedure) were carried out. Along with periodontal therapy, she was also managed through restorative phase where a successful outcome was achieved. She was then followed-up with maintenance care, and nifedipine was substituted with captopril by the Physician to facilitate maintenance.

257,pub.1126487586,10.2139/ssrn.3566661,,,,Competition and Risk,"Merger review in the United States has overlooked a significant competition harm: increasing risk. Mergers can increase both direct and systemic risk. There is now persuasive evidence that negative shocks to a firm can harm the firm’s consumers and trading partners, leading to national economic effects. And, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown all too clearly, how we structure our markets can become a matter of life and death overnight. I argue that mergers that increase risk by harming competition can be blocked under the Clayton Act. Risk should therefore be treated like innovation in merger review as a factor that can increase or decrease merger legality. I show when a merger is likely to change risk, to whom, and in what direction. Important factors include pre- and post-merger market power, consumer exposure, and economic centrality. When a merger increases risk because of a harm to competition, that increased risk is an antitrust harm and can therefore be used to block the merger. Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice’s prosecutorial discretion allows them to consider risk harms in merger review even when such harms are not the direct result of reduced competition. To illustrate, I apply risk analysis to a large generic pharmaceuticals merger. I conclude with recommendations on how to incorporate risk analysis into merger review. Doing so reveals otherwise invisible but significant merger harms and demonstrates that merger efficiencies have serious costs in addition to their often-discussed benefits. In an Appendix, I propose language for a new section on risk that the new administration can consider if it revises the DOJ and FTC’s Horizontal Merger Guidelines.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Bloomfield, Doni","Bloomfield, Doni (Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School; Yale Law School)",,"Bloomfield, Doni ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,0.63,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126487586,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 44 Human Society,Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims

How did the market for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives grow so large and so risky with so little public supervision and regulation? At the heart of the matter, I contend, are changes in how both derivatives and risk have been understood as objects of governance. This article focuses on the decade preceding the passage of the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act to demonstrate how competing and ultimately shifting understandings of both derivatives and financial risk put in place the conditions of possibility for the definitive deregulation of this market. Through a detailed interpretive analysis of regulatory documents, I show that changes in OTC derivatives regulation have been driven by changes in how regulators interpret derivatives themselves in a context of changing beliefs about risk and its management. Although regulators were acutely aware of OTC derivatives’ contribution to systemic risk as early as the early 1990s, they ultimately concluded that derivatives’ ability to serve as tools of risk management and generators of financial profits was consistent with their goal of promoting deep and liquid financial markets and thus took a decisively hands-off approach to regulation. The article concludes with a discussion of what shifts in interpretation and regulation of derivatives can tell us about the limits and potential for lasting post-crisis changes in financial governance.","I would like to thank Bruce Carruthers and Stephen Nelson for their many iterations of comments on this article.

We map these hypotheses into a two-stage hierarchical test which combines insights from the early-warning literature on financial crises with recent advances on growth-at-risk. Applying it to a set of candidate variables, we find that the Basel III credit-to-GDP gap does not serve the goal of coherently indicating systemic risk across the panel of G7 countries. A composite financial cycle measure does indicate systemic risk up to three years ahead, but its single components like credit growth or house price growth do not pass our test.

This research thus creatively analyzes the determinants of systemic risk for Chinese financial institutions from the view of asset price bubbles. First, we identify bubbles in the China stock and real estate markets on the basis of the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) model and explain the reasons for bubble formations according to the stage of China's economic development and policies implementation. At this stage, considering the differences in economic development levels of different cities, the real estate bubbles in the first, second and third tier cities and the whole country were innovatively identified. Second, on the basis of the DCG-GARCH-CoVaR model to measure the systemic risk of listed financial institutions in China and to classify institutions, the results show that the main source of such risk is the banking sector. Furthermore, by constructing regression models, stock market bubbles and real estate bubbles both positively correlate with systemic risk throughout the sample period. Meanwhile, the impact of bubbles on the systemic risk of different types of financial institutions was taken into account so that regulators prioritized different types of institutions with different characteristics when faced with decisions. Finally, we provide macro-prudential policy advice to regulators in order to weaken the impact of bubbles on financial stability to avoid systemic crises.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Using quarterly data on U.S. bank holding companies from 2003 to 2016, we document that liquidity creation decreases systemic risk at the individual bank level after controlling for bank size, asset risk, and other bank-specific attributes. After decomposing systemic risk into bank-specific tail risk and systemic linkage, we find that the riskiness of individual banks is negatively linked to liquidity creation. Nevertheless, our results also demonstrate that liquidity creation strengthens the systemic linkage of individual banks to severe shocks in the financial system. Overall, our empirical findings demonstrate that the level of liquidity creation may have important implications for financial stability and the prudential supervision of financial institutions.",,"The process of liquidity creation essentially involves the transformation of liquid deposits into illiquid assets. At the same time, the level of deposit funding is an important determinant of systemic risk (see e.g, Mayordomo et al., 2014; Iqbal et al., 2015; and Van Oordt and Zhou, 2019a). Previous studies have documented that systemic risk is generally lower for banks that have a more traditional business model in which lending activities are mostly funded with deposits. Therefore, it is of interest to examine whether bank funding structure potentially influences the link between liquidity creation and systemic risk. As the next step of our analysis, we split our sample into three subsamples based on the amount of deposits relative to total assets. Banks with deposits-to-assets ratios in the bottom and the top quintiles are regarded as the banks with the least and the most traditional funding structures, respectively, and the banks in the middle quintiles can be considered to have non-distinctive funding profiles. Table 8 reports the regression results based on the three funding structure subsamples. The adjusted R 2s of these regressions range from 33 percent to 42 percent, being lowest for banks with the least traditional funding profile and highest for the most traditional banks. The estimates in Table 8 indicate that the linkage between liquidity creation and systemic risk is influenced by bank funding structure. Specifically, the estimated coefficients for Total LC are negative and statistically highly significant when the regressions are estimated using banks with lowest and medium levels of deposit funding while being insignificant in the subsample of banks with the most traditional funding structure. These regression results suggest that the documented negative linkage between liquidity creation and systemic risk is more pertained to banks with lower deposits-to-assets ratios. The strong negative association implies that a decrease in liquidity creation increases systemic risk most strongly for banks that rely more on nontraditional funding sources for their lending business. The magnitudes of the estimated coefficients suggest that a one standard deviation decrease in Total LC increases Systemic risk of banks with the least traditional funding structure by about 8.1 percent, while the corresponding increase in Systemic risk is 4.7 percent for banks with a more standard funding profile.",Journal of Banking & Finance,,Elsevier,"0378-4266, 1872-6372",,2021-02,2021,,2021-02,123,,106031,Closed,Article,"Davydov, Denis; Vähämaa, Sami; Yasar, Sara","Davydov, Denis (University of Vaasa, School of Accounting and Finance, P.O.

We propose a statistical method that measures connectivity in the financial sector using time series of firms' stock returns. Our method is based on system-wide lower-tail analysis, whereby we estimate linkages between firms that occur when those firms are distressed and that exist conditional on the financial information of all other firms in the sample. This is achieved using Lasso-penalized quantile vector autoregression. By considering centrality measures of the estimated networks, we can assess the build-up of systemic risk and identify risk propagation channels. We apply our method to monthly returns of large U.S. firms, demonstrating that we are able to detect many of the most recent systemic events, in addition to identifying key players in the 2007-2009 U.S. financial crisis. Importantly, these players are not identified using standard Granger causality, which estimates connectivity by averaging across good, bad, and normal days of the market.",,,,Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Data Science for Macro-Modeling with Financial and Economic Datasets,Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),,,2018-06-15,2018,2018-06-15,2018-06-15,,,4,Closed,Proceeding,"Karpman, Kara; Basu, Sumanta","Karpman, Kara (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY); Basu, Sumanta (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY)",,"Karpman, Kara (Cornell University); Basu, Sumanta (Cornell University)",Cornell University,grid.5386.8,Ithaca,New York,United States,,,,,,2,2,,0.92,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105229876,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims
256,pub.1102345173,10.2139/ssrn.2101465,,,,Stress Scenario Selection by Empirical Likelihood,"This paper develops methods for selecting and analyzing stress scenarios for financial risk assessment, with particular emphasis on identifying sensible combinations of stresses to multiple variables. We begin by focusing on reverse stress testing — finding the most likely scenarios leading to losses exceeding a given threshold. We approach this problem using a nonparametric empirical likelihood estimator (in the sense of Owen (2001)) of the conditional mean of the underlying market factors given large losses. We then scale confidence regions for the conditional mean by a factor that depends on the tails of the market factors to estimate the most likely loss scenarios. We provide rigorous justification for the confidence regions and the scaling procedure in three models of the joint distribution of market factors with qualitatively different tail behavior: multivariate normal (light-tailed), multivariate Laplace (exponentially tailed), and multivariate-t (regularly varying). The key to this analysis (and the differences across the three cases) lies in the asymptotics of the conditional variances and covariances in extremes. These results also lead to asymptotics for marginal expected shortfall and the corresponding variance, conditional on extreme losses; we combine these results with empirical likelihood significance tests of systemic risk rankings based on marginal expected shortfall. For the problem of selecting macro stress scenarios, we apply our results to estimate the most likely outcome for other variables given a stress in one variable, and thus to gauge the plausibility of particular combinations of stresses to financial and economic factors. Finally, we propose a scenario sampling method, suggested by the empirical likelihood contours, for exploring regions of large losses in generating stress scenarios.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2012,2012,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Glasserman, Paul; Kang, Chulmin; Kang, Wanmo","Glasserman, Paul (Columbia Business School); Kang, Chulmin (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)); Kang, Wanmo (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST))",,"Glasserman, Paul (); Kang, Chulmin (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology); Kang, Wanmo (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)",Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,grid.37172.30,Daejeon,,South Korea,,,,,,10,0,,3.8,3.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102345173,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4905 Statistics",Behavioral and Social Science; Mental Health,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,,dims

A SORTE conjugates the classical Bühlmann’s notion of a risk exchange equilibrium with a capital allocation principle based on systemic expected utility optimization. In this paper we extend such a notion to the case when the value function to be optimized is multivariate in a general sense, and it is not simply given by the sum of univariate utility functions. This takes into account the fact that preferences of single agents might depend on the actions of other participants in the game. Technically, the extension of SORTE to the new setup requires developing a theory for multivariate utility functions and selecting at the same time a suitable framework for the duality theory. Conceptually, this more general framework allows us to introduce and study a Nash Equilibrium property of the optimizer.

It is essential to understand the risk factors of diabetic retinopathy before effective prevention can be implemented. The aim of this review was to examine the association between diabetic retinopathy and systemic risk factors.
METHODS: A PubMed literature search was performed up to May 2016 to identify articles reporting associations between diabetic retinopathy and systemic risk factors; only publications written in English were included. Relevant articles were selected and analysed.
RESULTS: Patients with diabetic retinopathy were more likely to have poor glycaemic control as reflected by a higher glycated haemoglobin, longer duration of diabetes, and use of insulin therapy for treatment. For other systemic risk factors, hypertension was positively associated with prevalence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. No clear association between obesity, hyperlipidaemia, gender, or smoking with diabetic retinopathy has been established as studies reported inconsistent findings. Myopia was a protective factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy. Several genetic polymorphisms were also found to be associated with an increased risk of development of diabetic retinopathy.

192,pub.1102202463,10.2139/ssrn.485763,,,,The Foundations of Banks' Risk Regulation: A Review of the Literature,"The stability of the banking industry around the world has been observed as periodical since the Great Depression. Financial markets have changed dramatically over the last twenty-five years, introducing more competition for and from banks. Banks are the financial institutions responsible for providing liquidity to the economy. This responsibility is, however, the main cause of their fragility. Deposit insurance is the most efficient instruments for protecting depositors and for preventing bank runs. Pricing deposit insurance according to the individual bank's risk seems to be the most appropriate strategy but it does not seem to be sufficient in the sense that it seems to remain residual information problems in the market, although there is no appropriate analysis on this issue. In 1988, the G10 modified banking regulation significantly by setting capital standards for international banks. These standards have now been adopted by more than one hundred countries as part of their national regulation of banks' risk. Current regulation of bank capital adequacy has its critics because it imposes the same rules on all banks. This seems particularly unsuitable when applied to credit risk which is the major source of a bank's risk (about 70%). Moreover, diversification of a bank's credit-risk portfolio is not taken into account in the computation of capital ratios. These shortcomings seem to have distorted the behaviour of banks and this makes it much more complicated to monitor them. In fact, it is not even clear that the higher capital ratios observed since the introduction of this new form of capital regulation necessarily lower risks. Additional reform is expected in 2004, but there is as yet no consensus on the form it will take nor on whether it will suitably regulate banks in individual countries. Consequently, it might be appropriate to continue developing national regulation based on optimal deposit insurance (with individual insurance pricing and continuous auditing on individual risk) and to keep searching for other optimal complementary instruments for use against systemic risk, instruments suitably designed to fit the banking industry's peculiar structure. Other market discipline (such as subordinated debt) and governance instruments may be more efficent than the current capital requirement scheme for the banks' commitment problem associated to deposit insurance. The central bank should be responsible for aggregate liquidity. Confidence in the financial sector is a public good that must be ensured by the government. Who should be in charge: the central bank or a regulatory agency? The revised literature seems to say that this role should be taken by a regulatory agency independent from the central bank and independent from the political power.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2003,2003,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dionne, Georges","Dionne, Georges (HEC Montreal - Department of Finance)",,"Dionne, Georges ()",,,,,,,,,,,4,1,,0.85,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102202463,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Patient Safety,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

the stock crash, especially for China where inexperienced investors dominate
the market. However, existing models rarely consider investors in networking
stocks and accordingly miss the exact knowledge of how panic contagion leads to
abrupt crash. In this paper, by networking stocks of sharing common mutual
funds, a new methodology of investigating the market crash is presented. It is
surprisingly revealed that the herding, which origins in the mimic of seeking
for high diversity across investment strategies to lower individual risk, will
produce too-connected-to-fail stocks and reluctantly boosts the systemic risk
of the entire market. Though too-connected stocks might be relatively stable
during the crisis, they are so influential that a small downward fluctuation
will cascade to trigger severe drops of massive successor stocks, implying that
their falls might be unexpectedly amplified by the collective panic and result
in the market crash. Our findings suggest that the whole picture of portfolio

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data 1999 to 2005. Demographic data and injury severity score were obtained from medical records. Factors reviewed included perioperative complications (nonunion, postoperative infection, loss of fixation) and time to radiographic and clinical union.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with 16 distal femur and 36 proximal tibia fractures were treated using temporary EF. Patients subsequently underwent ORIF (mean time from EF to ORIF = 5 days, range 1-23 days). Thirty-five fractures were open (Gustilo I = 8, II = 6, IIIA = 3, IIIB = 13, IIIC = 5) and 17 closed. Forty patients with 44 fractures reached 1-year follow-up. Of these, 36 patients with 40 (91%) fractures had healed both radiographically and clinically. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 14 months (range 3-68). Eight (16%) deep infections occurred, all in open fractures (Gustilo I = 2, IIIB = 3, IIIC = 3), with one patient requiring above knee amputation. Other complications included one hematoma, two malunions, one fixation failure, and one pin site infection. One patient died as a result of a stroke.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Temporary bridging EF offers the advantage of early soft tissue and bone stabilization without the potential local risks of immediate ORIF in severely injured soft tissues, or the potential systemic risks in a severely traumatized patient. The 16% infection rate in this study, all occurring in open fractures, falls within the reported range for grade III open fractures (15%-20%). We conclude that the initial treatment of high-energy periarticular knee fractures with bridging EF, followed by planned conversion to internal fixation is a safe option in patients who are unsuitable for initial definitive surgery.",,,Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery,,Wolters Kluwer,"2163-0755, 2163-0763, 0022-5282, 1529-8809",Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Femoral Fractures; Fracture Fixation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Tibial Fractures; Treatment Outcome,2008-03,2008,,2008-03,64,3,736-739,Closed,Article,"Parekh, Anand A.; Smith, Wade R.; Silva, Selina; Agudelo, Juan F.; Williams, Allison E.; Hak, David; Morgan, Steven J.","Parekh, Anand A.

Our study examines the mechanisms that minimized the spill over of the banking crisis, and allowed the U.S. capital markets to remain not only open, but also relatively liquid, during the crisis.

METHODS: A cross sectional study of diabetic retinopathy was conducted on 1,826 eyes of 913 randomly selected patients with type 2 diabetes in 9 central hospitals in Aomori Prefecture and the surrounding district. Retinopathy levels and maculopathy were assessed by binocular funduscopy, fundus photography and, if necessary, by fluorescein angiography. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent effects of systemic risk factors on diabetic retinopathy.
RESULTS: The prevalence of background retinopathy was 31%, of preproliferative retinopathy 5%, and of proliferative retinopathy 5% in all patients. However, in 3 hospitals in which the patients were routinely examined by fluorescein angiography, background retinopathy was found to be present in 60%, preproliferative retinopathy in 5%, and prolifertive retinopathy in 7%. Maculopathy was found in 8% of diabetic patients and the prevalence was 11% in the eyes with background retinopathy, 40% with preproliferative retinopathy, and 50% with proliferative retinopathy. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that retinopathy was significantly associated with duration of diabetes, methods of diabetic control, hypertension, nephropathy, and neuropathy.
CONCLUSION: The detection rate of background diabetic retinopathy by fluorescein angiography was twice as sensitive as that by binocular funduscopy and fundus photography. The prevalence of maculopathy increases with the progression of retinopathy. Several systemic risk factors have significant association with diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy.",,,Acta Soc Ophthal Jap,,,0029-0203,"Aged; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Hospitals, Community; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence",2001-11,2001,,2001-11,105,11,760-5,Closed,Article,"Matsuhashi, H; Tamura, M; Kudoh, M; Suda, T; Yagihashi, S; Nakazawa, M","Matsuhashi, H (Department of Ophthalmology, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, 5 Zaifu-cho, Hirosaki 036-8562, Japan.); Tamura, M (); Kudoh, M (); Suda, T (); Yagihashi, S (); Nakazawa, M ()",,"Matsuhashi, H (Hirosaki University); Tamura, M (); Kudoh, M (); Suda, T (); Yagihashi, S (); Nakazawa, M ()",Hirosaki University,grid.257016.7,Hirosaki,,Japan,,,,,,2,0,0.05,0.26,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074965464,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Prevention,Eye; Metabolic and endocrine,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

Evidence from China's financial and real estate sectors,"The occurrence of global public safety incidents often affects systemic financial risk. Based on the event analysis method, this study provides a specific analysis of COVID-19's impact on China's financial systemic risks. Additionally, the study demonstrates the different features of systemic financial risk in different financial sectors (banking, securities, insurance) and real estate during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, first, COVID-19's influence on systemic financial risk in all sectors exhibits both level effect and trend effect, and the impact is particularly significant in branch sectors under real estate. Second, in the entire financial system, the securities and real estate sectors not only contribute more to the growth of systemic risk than the banking and insurance sectors but are also more persistent. Third, real estate, residential property, and park comprehensive industries with high debt, long cycles, and high financial dependence are less affected by COVID-19 on systemic financial risks than other industries. Fourth, in the transmission mechanism, COVID-19 impacts market liquidity, funding liquidity, and default risk in the financial sector and real estate sector; however, the sources of systemic risk in different sectors differ.","Acknowledgement This study is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71971192), Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation (No. 19YJC790042), Zhejiang Province Natural Science Foundation (No. LY19G010005).","Funding liquidity refers to the ability of an institution or company to raise funds in a short period. In this study, (15) F _ LIQ i = a i − l i / A i where ai is short-term assets, li is short-term liabilities, and Ai is total assets. Thereafter, F_LIQ i is the ratio of the gap between short term assets and short term liabilities to the total assets. The data from the quarterly statements are used. The larger the funding gap, the more the circulating fund the enterprises have, and the better the financing liquidity. Since this indicator is long-term data, event analysis cannot be used. The changes in funding liquidity risk of each sector in 8 quarters from 2019 to 2020 can reflect the impact during the period of COVID-19 outbreak, as shown in Fig. 7 . Fig. 7 shows that the funding liquidity in all financial sectors and the real estate sector exhibit an evident decreasing trend during the COVID-19 outbreak. Particularly, the securities and real estate sectors exhibit a downward trend throughout 2020. This suggests that the two sectors faced severe funding liquidity risk due to COVID-19.

It is shown that the rapid spread of digital technologies entails irreversible changes that every member of society inevitably faces. The key systemic risks of digitalization are highlighted and considered: the likelihood of imbalances in the labor market leading to an increase in unemployment; the tendency to dehumanize social life and communica-tions, ousting “man” from it; the need to transform familiar social institutions, which can cause social and political upheaval; the trend towards digital segregation of the population, generating public discontent and division in society. It is shown that the scale and speed of digitalization processes make it impossible for society to independently solve these problems. The conclusion is made about the need for active participation of the state in the pro-cesses of digitalization and, in particular, the for-mation and delivery of the “image of the digital fu-ture” to the population, as a model of the country's digitalization, which also includes aspects of social development.",,,Общество политика экономика право,,"HORS Publishing House, LLC","2071-9701, 2223-6392, 20719701, 22236392",,2020-10-23,2020,2020-10-23,2020-11,,10,42-47,Closed,Article,"Kuznetsov, Nikolay Vladimirovich","Kuznetsov, Nikolay Vladimirovich (of Financial University  under the Government of the Russian Federation)",,"Kuznetsov, Nikolay Vladimirovich (Financial University)",Financial University,grid.440626.2,Moscow,,Russia,,,,,,2,2,,1.32,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133522620,44 Human Society; 4410 Sociology,Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C21 Sociology,,dims

CRFR are forward looking, non-linear, systemic and endogenous – attributes that render quantitative estimates of physical and transition risk subject to radical uncertainty. CRFR are also characterised by asymmetric time horizons: the worst impacts will emerge over the long term but the trajectory of future scenarios is endogenous to actions taken in the nearer term. Even pioneering forward-looking stress tests cannot feasibly capture all possible tail risks. We propose supplementing the existing capital requirements regime by giving it a stronger precautionary and macroprudential focus, paying particular attention to the prevention of environmental tipping points to avoid systemic and catastrophic impacts on the financial system and macroeconomy.Three complementary interventions are proposed. Firstly, classifying new and existing fossil fuel exposures as higher risk within the Pillar 1 framework would help address the systemic underpricing of CRFR in the most sensitive asset classes for all regulated financial institutions. Secondly, to explicitly deal with the time horizon-, systemic risk and endogeneity challenges, we propose a new Pillar 4 be introduced. This would dynamically tie prudential policy to the net-zero carbon transition via the imposition of variable capital risk weights on all fossil fuel-related assets, reflecting the global ´overshoot´ from a safe carbon budget within a 1.5C scenario. Thirdly, a climate systemic risk buffer could be applied to those institutions with the largest exposures to CRFR. This would both enhance financial system resilience and internalise the systemic risks created by such institutions.To successfully implement such reforms would require closer attention to the measurement and disclosure of negative environmental impacts by financial and non-financial firms as a proxy for the assessment of CRFR. Greater policy coordination between financial supervisors, ministries of finance and other relevant government agencies would also support a more strongly climatealigned capital regime.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ford, Greg; Kedward, Katie; Krebel, Lukasz; Ryan-Collins, Josh; Vaccaro, James; van Lerven, Frank","Ford, Greg (Finance Watch); Kedward, Katie (UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose); Krebel, Lukasz (New Economics Foundation); Ryan-Collins, Josh (Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose); Vaccaro, James (Climate Safe Lending Network); van Lerven, Frank (New Economics Foundation)",,"Ford, Greg (); Kedward, Katie (); Krebel, Lukasz (New Economics Foundation); Ryan-Collins, Josh (); Vaccaro, James (); van Lerven, Frank (New Economics Foundation)",New Economics Foundation,grid.422572.4,London,England,United Kingdom,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152111287,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities; 13 Climate Action,dims

Using credit rating data from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch for the period ranging from 2002 to 2016, we identify both positive and negative bank-to-sovereign spillover effects, and find the negative rating spillover effect to be more pronounced than the positive one. Further, we provide evidence on differences among the three rating agencies in terms of the occurrence of positive spillovers, and the degree of negative spillovers. Our results are robust to the changes in model specifications with respect to the currency type of ratings, the structure of regression models, and the approach used to link bank and sovereign ratings.

It begins with an overview of research and analyses of whether insurance activities and entities pose systemic risk. The chapter then summarizes the FSOC process for designating nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council's (FSOC) stated rationale for designating American International Group (AIG) as systemically important. Three issues are then briefly considered: (i) regulatory and compliance costs and potential undesirable market disruptions from designation of insurance entities as SIFIs subject to enhanced supervision; (ii) the design of enhanced capital requirements for insurer SIFIs; and (iii) the risk that designation of insurer SIFIs would ultimately reduce market discipline by expanding “too big to fail” policy.

I measure hedge funds' systemic risk contribution using Co-Expected Shortfall approach that is consistent with Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon and Richardson and Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009). First, I investigate whether hedge funds with similar characteristics are ""systemic as part of a herd"", and thus are associated with systemic risk. I find that hedge funds' systemic risk contribution varies significantly based on fund characteristics such as investment strategy, leveraging instruments and the level of asset liquidity. The findings suggest that the systemic hedge funds are not usually exposed to high financial risk, which provides important implications for proposed regulation, since when capital requirements are based on Value-at-Risk ratios, they are not necessarily tight for systemic hedge funds. Finally, I demonstrate that the fund's lagged systemic risk contribution is an important determinant in the cross-section of hedge fund returns. Using multivariate regressions and portfolio sorts, I find that systemic funds deliver significantly lower (risk-adjusted) returns than their peers especially during the times of financial distress. This implies that when an investor evaluates the expected return of a hedge fund as well as the associated risk, the investor should also consider the fund-specific characteristics associated with the fund's systemic risk contribution.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Joenväärä, Juha","Joenväärä, Juha (Aalto University School of Business; University of Maryland - Robert H.

We propose a new bank systemic risk measure to consider the two components of systemic risk: cross-sectional and time dimension. The aim is to highlight the “time-space dynamics” of contagion, i.e., if the CDS spread of bank i depends on the CDS spread of other banks. To do this, we use an advanced spatial econometrics design with a time-varying spatial dependence that can be interpreted as an index of the degree of cross-sectional spillovers. The findings highlight that the Eurozone banks have strong spatial dependence in the evolution of CDS spread, namely the contagion effect is present and persistent. Moreover, we analyse the role of the European Central Bank in managing contagion risk. We find that monetary policy has been effective in reducing systemic risk. However, the results show that systemic risk does not imply a policy intervention, highlighting how financial stability policy is not yet an objective.","We wish to thank participants of the “12th South-Eastern European Economic Research Workshop” at Bank of Albania (BoA, Tirana), 6–7 December 2018, and the “XXVII International Rome Conference on Money, Banking and Finance”, at LUISS University (Rome), 10–11 December 2018, for very helpful comments and remarks.

409,pub.1004704734,10.1108/15265941111158460,,,,The structural fragility of financial systems,"Purpose Lessons from the most recent financial crisis show specific vulnerabilities of financial markets due to weaknesses in the structure of the financial system (structural fragility). As the literature points out, the impact of systemic risk can be closely related to issues of concentration (“too big to fail”) and dependency (“too connected to fail”). However, different structural variables are emphasized in various ways, and most authors analyze each variable separately. This raises the questions of how structural fragility, as a cause of systemic distress, can be assessed more comprehensively and consistently, and what the implications are for modeling it within an integrated systemic risk framework. This paper seeks to address these issues.   Design/methodology/approach On the basis of theoretical considerations and in the light of current transformations in financial markets, this paper explores elements of structural fragility and the requirements for modeling them.   Findings The paper suggests an extended approach for conceptualizing structural fragility, evaluates directions for quantifying structural issues in early warning systems (EWSs) for systemic crises, and lays a theoretical groundwork for further empirical studies.   Originality/value The need for supervisory actions to prevent crises is urgent, as is the need for integrating structural aspects into EWSs for systemic financial crises. Since a significant aspect of a financial firm's risk comes from outside the firm, individual institutions should understand and monitor the structural aspects of the various risk networks they are in.",,,The Journal of Risk Finance,,Emerald,"0965-7967, 1758-4086, 1526-5943",,2011-08-16,2011,,2011-08-16,12,4,270-290,Closed,Article,"Gramlich, Dieter; Oet, Mikhail V.","Gramlich, Dieter (Baden‐Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University, Heidenheim, Germany); Oet, Mikhail V.

                  In the macro-prudential literature, ‘inaction bias’ describes the supposed tendency of macro-prudential actors to favour inaction over action when considering the use of macro-prudential tools. While inaction bias is a topic of much interest in macro-prudential policy circles, it has received scant attention from legal scholarship. The aim of this article is to contribute to filling this gap by studying inaction in an EU macro-prudential context and by evaluating the institutional arrangements that were put in place in order to address so-called inaction bias. Several actors at the EU level have a role to play in macro-prudential supervision, especially the European Systemic Risk Board and the European Central Bank (ECB). This paper will assess their capabilities and their capacity to turn these into actions. The role of the ECB will be of particular interest since it was vested with real powers to address possible inaction bias among states participating in the Banking Union. Among other things, I will examine whether the ECB’s macro-prudential powers are the cure to the problems that are said to underpin inaction bias at the national level.",,,Journal of Financial Regulation,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"2053-4833, 2053-4841",,2019-03-05,2019,2019-03-05,2019-03-19,5,1,1-28,All OA; Green,Article,"Schammo, Pierre","Schammo, Pierre (Durham University, School of Law, The Palatine Centre, Stockton Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom)",,"Schammo, Pierre (Durham University)",Durham University,grid.8250.f,Durham,,United Kingdom,,,,,,3,2,,7.02,5.0,http://dro.dur.ac.uk/27547/1/27547.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112207914,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4807 Public Law",,,,,,C18 Law,,dims
255,pub.1107114914,10.2139/ssrn.3250215,,,,Overlapping Legal Rules in Financial Regulation and the Administrative State,"Reforms which seek to overhaul the Dodd-Frank Act have begun to gain support within the Trump Administration and Congress. The leading proposals go beyond technical matters and reflect a wholesale critique: financial regulation has become too burdensome, too complex, and grants too much discretion to regulators. This article argues that what is really at stake in these debates is the distinct issue of “regulatory overlap”—meaning the joint use of multiple legal rules to address a common market failure. It begins by developing a general framework for analyzing overlapping legal rules of all kinds. That framework is then applied in case studies of the two cornerstones of financial regulation: capital adequacy requirements and resolution authority procedures. The most direct contribution of this article is to substantive issues in financial regulation. Each case study yields insights about particular portions of the Dodd-Frank Act that pending reforms attempt to eliminate, as well as the big picture problems of systemic risk and banks that are Too Big to Fail. On a more theoretical level, it also situates the concept of regulatory overlap within the law-and-economics literature on the optimal design of legal rules, where it is otherwise conspicuously absent. Lastly, the article shows how an analysis of overlapping rules in finance carries lessons for the regulatory process as a whole. It thereby adds to scholarship on administrative law, especially to research in that area that deals with a related set of problems concerning the structure of agency jurisdiction, regulatory cost-benefit analysis, and the role of uncertainty in the policymaking environment.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Turk, Matthew C.","Turk, Matthew C.

Pilot study in Lazio Region.,"OBJECTIVE: Specific regulations about education and training for body piercing licensure courses have to be considered due to the great increase in oral piercing practices. The aim of the present survey was to assess the local and systemic risk awareness in the practice of oral piercing and their prevention in a sample of Italian piercers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous 20-item questionnaire was administered to 30 body licensed piercers in a small town of central Italy. Licenses certificates were issued by Lazio Region after the completion of an approved training program for standard body piercing including 90 hours of course and a final examination as provided by regional law. The questionnaire surveyed on oral cavity anatomy, local and systemic risks as result of oral piercing, piercing maintenance and need of a dental visit.
RESULTS: Response rate was 66.6%. Only 20% of respondents was aware about oral cavity anatomy and none had knowledge about tongue and gums anatomy. Only 10% enlightened the need of a dental visit and 30% was aware about piercingrelated temporary paralysis. The piercing maintenance was habitually proposed only by 40% of respondents.

SDG6 has created business opportunities for private actors to contribute to sanitation coverage in novel consortia involving public agencies, private actors, international bodies and social enterprises. Can there be tension between the pursuit of public welfare and private interests in such consortia? If so, how can they be managed to eliminate open defecation? To contribute to answering these questions, we study the evolution of sanitation coverage in Kameshwaram village in India via interventions by two consortia and their impact in the short and medium terms. Our case study highlights five sources of challenges: disconnect with evaluation of innovation by beneficiary, partner risks, stakeholder risks, systemic risks and missing institutions. Private incentives can be aligned for social welfare, only if payoffs to consortium actors are based not only on the attainment of implementation targets, but also on the impact produced. Thus, incentive design must only reward toilet installations that are of quality construction, safe, functional, long-lasting and being used.","I would like to thank the staff of Friend In Need India, in particular Paranjothi most sincerely for the implementation of the survey.

The rate of system-wide bank failure is rendered endogenous, depending crucially on both the rate at which bad news arrives and on the maturity of debt contracts. The conditions under which the financial system makes a sharp transition from a dense network of credit relations to a sparse network where credit freezes readily occur are characterized. Our results also emphasize the role of hysteresis -- once broken, credit relations take a long time to re-establish as a result of common knowledge of the equilibrium. Our findings speak to the importance of tougher liquidity requirements as a means of reducing systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2009,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Anand, Kartik; Gai, Prasanna; Marsili, Matteo","Anand, Kartik (Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)); Gai, Prasanna (Australian National University (ANU)); Marsili, Matteo (Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP))",,"Anand, Kartik (Technical University of Berlin); Gai, Prasanna (Australian National University); Marsili, Matteo (International Centre for Theoretical Physics)",Technical University of Berlin; Australian National University; International Centre for Theoretical Physics,grid.6734.6; grid.1001.0; grid.419330.c,Berlin; Canberra; Trieste,; Australian Capital Territory; ,Germany; Australia; Italy,,,,,,3,0,,0.88,,http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/papers/pdf/SFB649DP2011-052.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102275418,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Minsky to construct an index of financial fragility for residential housing in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. In the process, a clear difference is made between financial fragility, bubble, and fraud. The goal is to capture the growing interdependence between debt and asset price on the upside. The index is able to capture the rapid growth of financial fragility in residential housing from the early 2000s and an usually high level of financial fragility from 2004 in the United States. However, the construction of the index reveals that the data available are of limited quantity and quality for the purpose at hand. If the Financial Stability Oversight Council is serious about measuring systemic risk, better data about cash flows and loan underwriting should be collected in order to get an idea of the quality of leverage. This quality is measured by focusing on the means used to service debts instead of ability and willingness to service debt per se (i.e. credit risk).",,,Journal of Post Keynesian Economics,,Taylor & Francis,"0160-3477, 1557-7821",,2014-07-01,2014,2014-07-25,2014-07-01,36,4,719-744,Closed,Article,"Tymoigne, Eric","Tymoigne, Eric (Department of Economics, Lewis and Clark College)",,"Tymoigne, Eric ()",,,,,,,,,,,11,1,,3.88,9.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024340373,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

An important aspect of risk assessment in construction is the development of a method by which the results of a risk analysis can be converted into recommendations for the admissibility of complex systemic risk. And also the degree of expediency of taking measures, the safety, necessary to reduce this risk in the construction industry. The Behavioral Engineering Model (BEM) developed by Gilbert provides us with a way to systematically and systemically identify barriers to individual and organizational performance. The BEM distinguishes between a person’s repertory of behavior (what the individual brings to the performance equation) and the environmental supports (the work environment factors that encourage or impede performance). By means of the Gilbert model this article will consider the risk criteria, determine the most significant risks of losses in the construction industry, and give suggestions on their minimization and elimination. In essence, the risk assessment is used to determine the measures that need to be taken to control the management or completely eliminate the risks that arise as a consequence of hazards. Qualitatively conducted engineering risk assessment and implementation of measures to prevent and minimize risks at the enterprise allows to reduce the probability of occurrence of dangerous events, thereby increasing security, and to reduce unprofitability. Engineering risk assessment can become one of the key links in the formation of the enterprise’s risk management system in construction.",,,"Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies",Smart Technologies and Innovations in Design for Control of Technological Processes and Objects: Economy and Production,Springer Nature,"2190-3018, 2190-3026",,2019-04-11,2019,2019-04-11,2020,138,,243-250,Closed,Chapter,"Borkovskaya, V.

Theoretical and empirical studies on climatic and ecological dynamical systems have shown that approach to tipping points is preceded by a generic phenomenon called critical slowing down, i.e. an increasingly slow response of the system to perturbations. Therefore, it has been suggested that critical slowing down may be used as an early warning signal of imminent critical transitions. Whether financial markets exhibit critical slowing down prior to meltdowns remains unclear. Here, our analysis reveals that three major US (Dow Jones Index, S&P 500 and NASDAQ) and two European markets (DAX and FTSE) did not exhibit critical slowing down prior to major financial crashes over the last century. However, all markets showed strong trends of rising variability, quantified by time series variance and spectral function at low frequencies, prior to crashes. These results suggest that financial crashes are not critical transitions that occur in the vicinity of a tipping point. Using a simple model, we argue that financial crashes are likely to be stochastic transitions which can occur even when the system is far away from the tipping point. Specifically, we show that a gradually increasing strength of stochastic perturbations may have caused to abrupt transitions in the financial markets. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of stochastically driven abrupt transitions in real world scenarios. Our study offers rising variability as a precursor of financial meltdowns albeit with a limitation that they may signal false alarms.","This work was supported by DBT-IISc partnership program and a DBT Ramalingaswamy fellowship to VG.

Lahar is the Indonesian term for volcanic ash, and lahar flows resulting from the massive amount of volcanic materials deposited on the mountain's slope posed continued post-eruption threats to the surrounding areas, destroying lives, homes, agricultural products, and infrastructures. Risks of lahar flows were identified immediately after the eruption, with scientific data provided by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other research institutions. However, competing political, economic, and social agendas subordinated the importance of scientific information to policy making. Using systemic risk analysis and management, this article addresses the issues of multiple objectives and the effective integration of scientific techniques into the decision-making process. It provides a modeling framework for identifying, prioritizing, and evaluating policies for managing risk. The major considerations are: (1) applying a holistic approach to risk analysis through hierarchical holographic modeling, (2) applying statistical methods to gain insight into the problem of uncertainty in risk assessment, (3) using multiobjective trade-off analysis to address the issue of multiple decisionmakers and stakeholders in the decision-making process, (4) using the conditional expected value of extreme events to complement and supplement the expected value in quantifying risk, and (5) assessing the impacts of multistage decisions. Numerical examples based on ex post data are formulated to illustrate applications to various problems. The resulting framework from this study can serve as a general baseline model for assessing and managing risks of natural disasters, which the Philippines' lead agency-the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC)-and other related organizations can use for their decision-making processes.",We thank Grace Zisk for her editorial assistance and Della Dirickson for her administrative assistance.,,Risk Analysis,,Wiley,"0272-4332, 1573-9147, 1539-6924",,2003-12,2003,2003-12,2003-12,23,6,1323-1335,Closed,Article,"Leung, M F; Santos, J R; Haimes, Y Y","Leung, M F (Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, Virginia, USA.); Santos, J R (); Haimes, Y Y ()","Haimes, Y Y ","Leung, M F (University of Virginia); Santos, J R (); Haimes, Y Y ()",University of Virginia,grid.27755.32,Charlottesville,Virginia,United States,,,,,,20,4,0.14,4.4,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018860819,37 Earth Sciences; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C14 Geography and Environmental Studies,,dims

We obtain coefficients of partial correlation from the correlation estimates of the Constant Conditional Correlation GARCH (CCC‐GARCH) and the consistent Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (cDCC‐GARCH) models. We map the graph of partial correlations using the Gaussian Graphical Model and apply network analysis to identify the most central firms in terms of both shock propagation and connectedness with others. Moreover we analyze some network characteristics over time and based on these we construct a measure of system vulnerability to external shocks. Our findings suggest that during the crisis interconnectedness between firms strengthens and becomes polarized and the system becomes more vulnerable to systemic shocks. In addition, we found that the most connected firms are the state‐owned firms Sberbank and Gazprom and the private oil company Lukoil, while in terms of the top most central systemic risk contributors, Sberbank gave its place to the NLMK Group.","The authors thank the Editor and three anonymous referees for very useful comments.

In this article, we use classical perturbation theory of dynamical systems to measure the global stability of the financial system. We analyze the bifurcation mechanism in the 2007-2009 financial crisis and extend the result to general financial crises. Historically a financial crisis has resulted from heavily leveraged overinvestment. When leverage is high economic agents are susceptible to decrease in revenue. Securitization interconnected the market agents, therefore a small default in one segment spread to the entire system, causing a systemic risk. We build a dynamic model of financial system with several economic aggregates, which we model like as many agents, and show that high leverage reduces borrowing capacity of economic agents, thus raises the reactions of agents to variations of their income - which we call elasticities. Elasticities can be directly measured from the observation of flows of funds between aggregates. The Jacobian matrix of the system is deduced by a simple formula from those elasticities. Too high elasticities break the financial equilibrium and eventually result in a crisis. Market instability can be monitored by measuring the highest eigenvalue - the spectral radius - of a matrix of the Jacobian matrix. This spectral radius can be used as an early indicator of market instability and potential crisis. Our contribution is to provide an actual way of measuring how close to chaos the market is. Estimating elasticities and actually generating the indicators of instability will be the topic of forthcoming research.

321,pub.1027479440,10.1111/rssb.12069,,,,Estimation of the marginal expected shortfall: the mean when a related variable is extreme,"Summary Denote the loss return on the equity of a financial institution as X and that of the entire market as Y. For a given very small value of p > 0, the marginal expected shortfall (MES) is defined as E{X|Y>QY(1−p)}, where Q  Y(1 − p) is the (1 − p)th quantile of the distribution of Y. The MES is an important factor when measuring the systemic risk of financial institutions. For a wide non-parametric class of bivariate distributions, we construct an estimator of the MES and establish the asymptotic normality of the estimator when p ↓ 0, as the sample size n → ∞. Since we are in particular interested in the case p = O(1/n), we use extreme value techniques for deriving the estimator and its asymptotic behaviour. The finite sample performance of the estimator and the relevance of the limit theorem are shown in a detailed simulation study. We also apply our method to estimate the MES of three large US investment banks.","We are grateful to the Associate Editor and two referees for various insightful comments and questions that led to this improved version of the manuscript.

Proposed federal legislation would mandate ""say on pay"" generally for US public companies. This paper assesses the case for such a mandatory federal rule in light of the UK experience with a similar regime adopted in 2002. The best argument for a mandatory rule is that it would destabilize pay practices that have produced excessive compensation and that would not yield to firm-by-firm pressure. This has not been the UK experience; pay continues to increase. The most serious concern is the likely evolution of a ""best compensation practices"" regime which would embed normatively-opinionated practices that would ill-suit many firms. There is some evidence of a UK evolution in that direction. This problem might be more pronounced in the US because US shareholders are even more likely than their UK counterparts to delegate judgements over compensation practices to a small number of proxy advisors who themselves will be economizing on analysis. The paper argues instead for a federally provided shareholder opt-in right to a ""say on pay"" regime, which would change the present reliance on precatory proposals in the issuer proxy which are in turn subject to the power delegated to shareholders under state law. Secondarily, the paper argues that any mandatory regime should be limited to the 500 the largest public companies by public market float and not cover the other 13,500 firms that make public disclosure. Compensation practices at key financial firms present a distinct set of safety and soundness issues because of potential systemic risk from a failure of such firms.

In recent years, however, it has become apparent that many of the risks facing society are systemic in nature – complex risks, set within wider social, economic and environmental contexts. Reflecting this, policy-making too has become more wide-ranging in scope, more collaborative and more precautionary in approach. In order to inform such policies, more integrated methods of assessment are needed. Based on work undertaken in two large EU-funded projects (INTARESE and HEIMTSA), this paper reviews the range of approaches to assessment now in used, proposes a framework for integrated environmental health impact assessment (both as a basis for bringing together and choosing between different methods of assessment, and extending these to more complex problems), and discusses some of the challenges involved in conducting integrated assessments to support policy.Integrated environmental health impact assessment is defined as a means of assessing health-related problems deriving from the environment, and health-related impacts of policies and other interventions that affect the environment, in ways that take account of the complexities, interdependencies and uncertainties of the real world. As such, it depends heavily on how issues are selected and framed, and implies the involvement of stakeholders both in issue-framing and design of the assessment, and to help interpret and evaluate the results. It is also a comparative process, which involves evaluating and comparing different scenarios. It consequently requires the ability to model the way in which the influences of exogenous factors, such as policies or other interventions, feed through the environment to affect health. Major challenges thus arise. Chief amongst these are the difficulties in ensuring effective stakeholder participation, in dealing with the multicausal and non-linear nature of many of the relationships between environment and health, and in taking account of adaptive and behavioural changes that characterise the systems concerned.","The work presented herein was undertaken in the context of two studies funded under the European Union 6th Framework Programme: INTARESE and HEIMTSA.

Cases from Australia and the United States,"In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis on achieving convergence in disaster research, policy, and programs to reduce disaster losses and enhance social well-being. However, there remain considerable gaps in understanding “how do we actually do convergence?” In this article, we present three case studies from across geographies—New South Wales in Australia, and North Carolina and Oregon in the United States; and sectors of work—community, environmental, and urban resilience, to critically examine what convergence entails and how it can enable diverse disciplines, people, and institutions to reduce vulnerability to systemic risks in the twenty-first century. We identify key successes, challenges, and barriers to convergence. We build on current discussions around the need for convergence research to be problem-focused and solutions-based, by also considering the need to approach convergence as ethic, method, and outcome. We reflect on how convergence can be approached as an ethic that motivates a higher order alignment on “why” we come together; as a method that foregrounds “how” we come together in inclusive ways; and as an outcome that highlights “what” must be done to successfully translate research findings into the policy and public domains.","The New South Wales case study is based on a doctoral research funded by the Australian Research Council (#DE150100242); a grant received from the New South Wales’ Office of Emergency Services’ Community Resilience Innovation Program (2015-2017) for the implementation of a collaborative project “Resilient together: Engaging the knowledge and capacities of refugees for a disaster-resilient Illawarra”; and an in-kind contribution in the form of a regional workshop convened by the Wollongong City Council.

240,pub.1142718949,10.1155/2021/1519019,,,,Nonlinear ARIMA Models with Feedback SVR in Financial Market Forecasting,"In recent years, as global financial markets have become increasingly connected, the degree of correlation between financial assets has become closer, and technological advances have made the transmission of information faster and faster, and information networks have integrated capital markets into one, making it easier for single financial market risk problems to form systemic risk through a high degree of market linkage effects. Based on the characteristics of financial markets containing both linear and nonlinear components, this paper chooses to use Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and feedback Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to effectively integrate the ARIMA model and the SVR model, taking into account their respective linear and nonlinear characteristics. The paper chooses to use the (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and feedback Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to effectively integrate the strengths of the ARIMA and SVR models in terms of linearity and nonlinearity to perform forecasting analysis of financial markets. One of the important functions of forecasting is to transform future uncertainty into measurable risk, so that we can base our plans and actions on it. In this paper, the combined ARIMA-SVR model is compared with the single ARIMA model and SVR model in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), where MAE and RMSE measure the absolute error between the predicted and true values, and MAPE measures the relative error between the predicted and true values. and the relative error between the true value. The results show that the combined ARIMA-SVR model has a better forecasting effect and higher forecasting accuracy than the single ARIMA model and SVR model, and the SVR model has higher forecasting accuracy than the ARIMA model in forecasting financial markets.",,,Journal of Mathematics,,Hindawi,"2314-4629, 2314-4785",,2021-11-11,2021,,2021-11-11,2021,,1-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Su, Shiwei","Su, Shiwei (School of Finance, Henan University of Economics and Law, Zhengzhou, Henan 450046, China, huel.edu.cn)","Su, Shiwei (Henan University of Economic and Law)","Su, Shiwei (Henan University of Economic and Law)",Henan University of Economic and Law,grid.464343.2,Zhengzhou,,China,,,,,,1,1,,0.92,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jmath/2021/1519019.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142718949,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

                    The purpose of this paper is to measure the systemic importance of industry in the world economic system under the system-wide event – the crisis of 2008-2009, by viewing this system as a weighted directed network of interconnected industries.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    First, the authors investigate this crisis at three different levels based on network-related indicators: the “macro” global level, the “meso” country level, and the “micro” industry level. This investigation not only provides evidence for the systemic influence, that is, systemic risk, of the crisis, but also reveals the contagion mechanism of the crisis, which supports the stress testing. Second, the authors use a network-related business intelligence algorithm, the combined hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, to measure the contribution of a given individual industry to the overall risk of the economic system or, in other words, the systemic importance of the individual industry.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The HITS algorithm considers both the market information and the interconnectedness of the industries. Based on the stress testing, the performance of the combined HITS is compared with the purely market-based systemic risk measurement. The results show that the combined HITS outperforms the baseline in finding the top N systemically important industries.
                  
                  
                    Practical implications
                    The combined HITS algorithm provides a novel network-based perspective of systemic risk measurement.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    Measuring the systemic importance based on the combined HITS algorithm can help managers and regulators design effective risk management policies. In this respect, the work initiates a research direction of studying the systemic risk in a business system based on a network-related business intelligence algorithm because the business system can be viewed as an interconnected network.","This research was supported by the National Science-technology Support Plan (project no. 2015BAK18B02); the Guangdong Provincial Technology Scheme (Grant No. 2015A020217007); the development grants from Shenzhen Science, Technology and Innovation Commission (Grant Nos.

Many have proposed the use of historical cost accounting, promoting its ability to avoid the amplification of systemic risk. We caution against focusing on the accounting rule in isolation, and instead emphasize the interaction between accounting and the regulatory framework. First, historical cost accounting, through incentives that arise via interactions with complex capital adequacy regulation, does generate market distortions of its own. Second, while mark-to-market accounting may indeed generate fire sales during a crisis, forward-looking institutions that rationally internalize the probability of fire sales are incentivized to adopt a more prudent investment strategy during normal times which leads to a safer portfolio entering the crisis. Using detailed, position- and transaction-level data from the US insurance industry, we show that (a) market prices do serve as ‘early warning signals’, (b) insurers that employed historical cost accounting engaged in greater degrees of regulatory arbitrage before the crisis and limited loss recognition during the crisis, and (c) insurers facing mark-to-market accounting tend to be more prudent in their portfolio allocations. Our identification relies on the sharp difference in statutory accounting rules between life and P&C companies as well as the heterogeneity in implementation of these rules within each insurance type across US states. Our results indicate that regulatory simplicity may be preferred to the complexity of risk-weighted capital ratios that gives rise, through interactions with accounting rules, to distorted risk-taking incentives and potential build-up of systemic risk.

We look at the effect of the new bank resolution reforms on the systemic risk of big financial conglomerates. We find that in developed countries, parent banks in a stricter resolution regime have lower systemic risk contributions, compared to their foreign subsidiaries. The opposite is true for parent banks from developing countries. We explain these results as financial conglomerates exploiting differences in resolution tools between parent and subsidiary banks, in particular in developing countries where rule enforcement is weaker.

In order to cope with such disasters and minimize social damage, it is necessary to focus on the affected social functions rather than on each type of disaster to minimize the damage and speed up the recovery process. To achieve this, it is necessary to establish an efficient matching mechanism between increasing disaster needs and limited supply capacity, using recent digital technology to achieve optimal resource allocation under uncertainty. Although response methods differ depending on the stage of the disaster, the basic idea is to share accurate information, and it is essential to accumulate information that can be utilized in the event of a disaster. In this chapter, as specific examples of how such information should be utilized, we demonstrate on how to increase resilience in the event of a disaster by clarifying the interdependence of urban critical infrastructure, and how to utilize the “My Number” system to effectively respond to the needs of disaster victims after a disaster.","This paper was written as a retirement commemorative paper for Professor Tatsuro Niikawa, based on Doshisha Policy Science Research 22(2), Supplement.",,Disaster Risk Reduction,"Society 5.0, Digital Transformation and Disasters",Springer Nature,"2196-4106, 2196-4114",,2022-10-26,2022,2022-10-26,2022,,,25-40,Closed,Chapter,"Morita, Akira","Morita, Akira (Next Generation Fundamental Policy Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan; University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan)","Morita, Akira (; University of Tokyo)","Morita, Akira (University of Tokyo)",University of Tokyo,grid.26999.3d,Tokyo,,Japan,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152191491,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics,,Generic health relevance,,,,B12 Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities,dims

We apply this methodology to a data set of mutual exposures and capital levels of financial institutions in Brazil in 2007 and 2008, and analyze the role of balance sheet size and network structure in each institution's contribution to systemic risk. Our results emphasize the contribution of heterogeneity in network structure and concentration of counterparty exposures to a given institution in explaining its systemic importance. These observations plead for capital requirements which depend on exposures, rather than aggregate balance sheet size, and which target systemically important institutions. Keywords Default risk, domino effects, balance sheet contagion, scale-free network, default contagion, systemic risk, macro-prudential regulation, random graph. Introduction The recent financial crisis has emphasized the importance of systemic risk, defined as macro-level risk which can impair the stability of the entire financial system. Bank failures have led in recent years to a disruption of the financial system and a significant spillover of financial distress to the larger economy (Hellwig, 2009). Regulators have had great difficulties anticipating the impact of defaults partly due to a lack of visibility on the structure of the financial system as well as a lack of a methodology for monitoring systemic risk. The complexity of the contemporary financial systems makes it a challenge to define adequate indicators of systemic risk that could help in an objective assessment of the systemic importance of financial institutions and an objective framework for assessing the efficiency of macro-prudential policies.",,,,Handbook on Systemic Risk,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,,2013-05-23,2013,2013-06-05,2013-05-23,,,327-368,All OA; Green,Chapter,"Cont, Rama; Moussa, Amal; Santos, Edson B.","Cont, Rama (); Moussa, Amal (); Santos, Edson B.

797,pub.1082858962,,8559026.0,,,Noma or cancrum oris: etiopathogenic and nosologic aspects.,"Noma is a gangrenous disease that usually begins in the mouth and is characterized by rapid necrotizing destruction of soft tissue and underlying bone. The disease, which is associated with a strong putrid odor suggestive of mixed bacterial infection, develops only in predisposed persons, especially children whose natural defenses have been weakened by poor socio-economic living conditions. However a few atypical cases have recently been reported in adults in whom the main risk factor seemed to be immunodepression. The increasing number of wars in the Third World and the AIDS epidemic raise the likelihood that the number of cases of this disease will rise sharply particularly since the incidence has been grossly underestimated for many years. It now seems clear that a combination of local and systemic risk factors are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of noma with the common denominator being a weakened immune system. This would account for the fulminating course of the infectious process due to one or more opportunistic microbial or cytopathogenic agents or even to a still undetermined immunopathologic reaction that lead to massive tissue destruction. Poor understanding of the etiopathogenesis of noma is a major factor perpetuating the nosologic problems posed by this disease. Some authors add to the confusion by including a range of gangrenous diseases under the heading of noma. It is important that the term noma be applied only to necrotizing processes that begin in the mouth and present the characteristic features and course.",,,Medecine Tropicale,,,"0025-682X, 2261-2173","Adult; Child; Child Nutrition Disorders; Global Health; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Noma; Oral Hygiene; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Terminology as Topic",1995,1995,,1995,55,3,263-73,Closed,Article,"Costini, B; Larroque, G; Duboscq, J C; Montandon, D","Costini, B (Service de Chirurgie Maxillo-faciale et Plastique de la Face, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Nord, Marseille, France.); Larroque, G (); Duboscq, J C (); Montandon, D ()",,"Costini, B (Hôpital Nord); Larroque, G (); Duboscq, J C (); Montandon, D ()",Hôpital Nord,grid.414244.3,Marseille,,France,,,,,,17,2,0.19,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1082858962,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,Rare Diseases,,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being,dims

This supplemental area-wide coverage would be similar to the existing Group Risk Plan policy, but with an accelerated indemnity schedule.

METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on patients who underwent cataract surgery in a public hospital over an 11-year period. An ocular infection database was used to report endophthalmitis occurrences and to collect the clinical features. Qualitative variables are described with their frequency distribution and qualitative variables, with the mean and the standard deviation.
RESULTS: From January 1999 to December 2009, 15.173 patients underwent cataract surgery. A total of 43 patients suffered from postoperative endophthalmitis, giving an overall infection rate of 0.28% (95% CI: 0.20-0.36%). Among the 43 cases, there were 19 men and 24 women with a mean age of 78.5. Other clinical parameters evaluated were as follows: 25.58% were diabetic, 44.18% had some degree of immunosuppression and there were complications with posterior capsular tears in 18.6%. As regards antibiotic prophylaxis, 2 groups were considered: the first one did not receive intracameral antibiotic (8,099 patients) and the second group received intracameral cefuroxime (7,074 patients). There were 39 endophthalmitis in the first group with an infection incidence of 0.48% and 4 endophthalmitis in the second group with an infection incidence of 0.056%. The relative risk (RR) after-before cefuroxime was 0.12 (0.04-0.33) with P<0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in an 11-year period was lower than 0.3%. Almost half of the patients had a higher systemic risk.

To understand the relationship between business cycles and cascades of bankruptcies, we model a three-sector economy with goods, credit and interbank market. In the interbank market, the participating banks share the risk of bad debits, which may potentially spread a bank's liquidity problems through the network of banks. Our agent-based model sheds light on the correlation between bankruptcy cascades and the endogenous economic cycle of booms and recessions. It also demonstrates the serious trade-off between, on the one hand, reducing risks of individual banks by sharing them and, on the other hand, creating systemic risks through credit-related interlinkages of banks.

members are interdependent in the sense that the failure of a few institutions
may trigger a chain of defaults throughout the system. Recently, several
systemic risk measures have been proposed in the literature that are used to
determine capital requirements for the members subject to joint risk
considerations. We address the problem of computing systemic risk measures for
systems with sophisticated clearing mechanisms. In particular, we consider an
extension of Rogers-Veraart network model where the operating cash flows are
unrestricted in sign. We propose a mixed-integer programming problem that can
be used to compute clearing vectors in this model. Due to the binary variables
in this problem, the corresponding (set-valued) systemic risk measure fails to
have convex values in general. We associate nonconvex vector optimization
problems to the systemic risk measure and provide theoretical results related
to the weighted-sum and Pascoletti-Serafini scalarizations of this problem.
Finally, we test the proposed formulations on computational examples and

Methods: A machine-learning-based KOA progression prediction model is developed using the data from the National Institute of Health Osteoarthritis Biomarkers Consortium. According to Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of plain radiographs at baseline, the subjects are divided into either KOA onset or deterioration study groups. The disease progression is defined as the changes in both joint space width (JSW) and WOMAC pain score. In addition to radiographic and symptomatic data, the anthropological particulars, history of the knee injury and surgery, metabolic syndrome and living habits were deployed in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict disease progression in each study group. The relative contributions of each risk factors were weighted via DeepLIFT gradient. Additionally, statistical interactions among risk factors were identified compared.
Results: Our model achieved AUC of 0.843 (95% CI 0.824, 0.862) and 0.765 (95% CI 0.756, 0.774) in prediction of KOA onset and deterioration, respectively. For KOA onset prediction, history of injury has attained the highest DeepLIFT gradient except medial joint space narrowing; while for KOA deterioration prediction, diabetes and habit of smoking obtained second and third highest gradients respectively aside from medial joint space narrowing, surpassing the impact of the injury.

On the other hand, the development of reliable models of interbank market structure is relevant as they can be used to analyze systemic risk in the absence of transaction data or to test statistical hypotheses regarding network properties. Based on a detailed data-driven analysis of bank positions (assets and liabilities) taken from the Bankscope database, we here develop a minimal, stochastic, agent-based network model that accounts for the basic topology of interbank networks reported in the literature. The main assumption of our model is that loans between banks attempt to compensate assets and liabilities at each time step, and the quarterly aggregation of daily networks yields structures comparable with those observed in empirical studies. In particular, our model is able to qualitatively reproduce degree distributions, the distributions of transactions by value and transactions by volume, the distribution of exposures (link weights), the correlations with nearest-neighbor averages, and the local structure (clustering coefficient). As our simple model captures the overall structure of empirical networks, it can thus be used as a null model for testing hypotheses relative to other specific properties of interbank networks.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Cuenda, Sara; Fernández, Maximiliano; Galeano, Javier; Capitán, José","Cuenda, Sara (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid); Fernández, Maximiliano (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid); Galeano, Javier (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid); Capitán, José (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid)",,"Cuenda, Sara (Autonomous University of Madrid); Fernández, Maximiliano (Technical University of Madrid); Galeano, Javier (Technical University of Madrid); Capitán, José (Technical University of Madrid)",Technical University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid,grid.5690.a; grid.5515.4,Madrid; Madrid,; ,Spain; Spain,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/10486/681665/1/minimal_cuenda_jasss_2018.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090421845,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,,dims

While lethal in male foetuses, heterozygous females survive because of X-inactivation mosaicism. Herein we discuss 9 male patients with IP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive, retrospective, multicentre, French study carried out with the help of the SFDP research group. Statistical analysis was performed both on our own patients and on those reported in the literature.
RESULTS: Nine boys with no family history of IP but with typical neonatal skin reactions were included. Genetic analysis of blood (n=8) and skin biopsy (n=3) confirmed the diagnosis of IP by identification of common deletion of the IKBKG/NEMO gene (exons 4 to 10) in the state of somatic mosaic in 6 and 2 cases respectively. Where analysed, the karyotype was normal (n=6). Over a median follow-up period of 48 months (3 months to 10 years), 3 patients had neurological abnormalities, 2 had severe ophthalmologic abnormalities, and 1 had dental abnormalities. Extensive skin involvement is a systemic risk factor, unlike cutaneous scarring.
CONCLUSION: IP in boys is often due to a mosaic mutation that should be sought in blood and skin.

The hypothesis, which was set up by examining empirical evidence, points to heterogeneity across the macroeconomic conditions prevailing in different clusters of EMU countries. Given the strengthened financial and real interconnections across the EMU countries, the capital flows triggered by widening distances between surplus and deficit trade balances, and also between sound and deteriorating public budgets, represent an important factor magnifying systemic risk and contagion. The econometric estimates we conducted concern two sub-periods, the two decades from the launch of the EMS in 1979 to 1999, and the first twelve years (1999–2010) of the monetary union. The findings sound as a confirmation that the strengthened financial and real interconnections across the EMU countries, instead of facilitating convergence among the Core and the Peripheral economies, have magnified and mutually reinforced imbalances. The divide between surplus and deficit countries – the backward EMU countries running larger current account deficits, and the more advanced countries accumulating larger current account surpluses – have brought about increasing capital outflows from the Periphery to pay for excess imports from the Core. Conversely, increasing capital flows were invested by the banks of the Core countries in the Periphery's public bonds.",,,Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,,Elsevier,"0167-2681, 1879-1751",,2012-08,2012,,2012-08,83,3,647-656,Closed,Article,"Angelini, Elisabetta Croci; Farina, Francesco","Angelini, Elisabetta Croci (DiSSE, Macerata University,Italy); Farina, Francesco (DEPFID, Siena University,Italy)","Angelini, Elisabetta Croci (University of Macerata)","Angelini, Elisabetta Croci (University of Macerata); Farina, Francesco (University of Siena)",University of Siena; University of Macerata,grid.9024.f; grid.8042.e,Siena; Macerata,; ,Italy; Italy,,,,,,12,4,,4.91,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027144133,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C16 Economics and Econometrics,,dims

The difficulties firms face in valuing derivatives portfolios are evaluated. Although academics pay much attention to no-arbitrage pricing results, the paper points out that there can be considerable subjectivity in the pricing of derivatives that do not have highly liquid markets. It is shown that the known risks of derivatives portfolios can generally be measured and managed well at the firm level.

961,pub.1151120608,10.1111/aos.15226,36117363.0,,,Lipid metabolism and retinal diseases,"PURPOSE: The retina has enormous lipids demands and must meet those needs. Retinal lipid homeostasis appears to be based on the symbiosis between neurons, Müller glial cells (MGC), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, which can be impacted in several retinal diseases. The current research challenge is to better understand lipid-related mechanisms involved in retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.
RESULTS: In a first axis, in vitro and focus on Müller glial cell, we aimed to characterize whether the 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), an overexpressed end-product of cholesterol elimination pathway in neural tissue and likely produced by suffering retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma, may modulate MGC membrane organization, such as lipid rafts, to trigger cellular signalling pathways related to retinal gliosis. We have found that lipid composition appears to be a key factor of membrane architecture, especially for lipid raft microdomain formation, in MGC. However, 24S-OHC did not appear to trigger retinal gliosis via the modulation of lipid or protein composition within lipid rafts microdomains. This study provided a better understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. On a second clinical ax, we focused on the lipid-related mechanisms involved in the dysfunction of aging RPE and the appearance of drusenoid deposits in AMD. Using the Montrachet population-based study, we intend to report the frequency of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and its ocular and systemic risk factors, particularly related to lipid metabolisms, such as plasma lipoprotein levels, carotenoids levels, and lipid-lowering drug intake. Our study showed that RPD was less common in subjects taking lipid-lowering drugs. Lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, may reduce the risk of RPD through their effect on the production and function of lipoproteins. This observation highlights the potential role of retinal lipid trafficking via lipoproteins between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium cells in RPD formation. Those findings have been complemented with preliminary results on the analysis of plasma fatty acid (FA) profile, a surrogate marker of short-term dietary lipid intake, according to the type of predominant drusenoid deposit, soft drusen or RPD, in age-related maculopathy.

This paper examines these issues with a model of the financial sector where the size of the shadow banking sector is endogenous. In the model, shadow banking is an alternative banking strategy which involves greater risk-taking at the expense of being exposed to “fundamental runs” on the funding side. When such runs occur, shadow banks liquidate their assets in a secondary market. Entry into shadow banking is profitable when traditional banks provide sufficient secondary market demand to prevent these liquidations from causing a fire-sale. During periods of stability, the shadow banking sector expands to an excessively large size that ferments systemic risk. Its collapse then triggers a fire-sale that renders traditional banks vulnerable to “liquidity runs”. The prospect of liquidity runs undermines market discipline and increases the risk-taking incentives of traditional banks. Policy interventions aimed at alleviating the fire-sale fuel further expansion of the shadow banking sector.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study carried out over a period of 2 years, type 2 diabetic patients seeking ocular evaluation for DR were assessed for presence and severity of DR, presence of hard exudates and CSME. Retinal findings were correlated to severity of microalbuminuria, hemoglobin concentration and other systemic risk factors using linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: Three hundred and six patients were included in the study. DR of any grade was seen in 132 (43%) patients, hard exudate formation in 93/306 (30.4%) patients, CSME in 50/306 (16.3%) patients and proliferative DR in 26/306 (8.5%) patients. Duration of diabetes (P < 0.001), microalbuminuria (P < 0.001) and low hemoglobin (P = 0.001) were found to be highly significant risk factors for the development and increasing severity of DR as well as for CSME and hard exudate formation.
CONCLUSION: Microalbuminuria and low hemoglobin are strong predictors for DR, CSME and hard exudate formation in type 2 diabetics even after correcting for duration of diabetes and other systemic risk factors. Although not directly involved in the pathogenesis, microalbuminuria can help in identifying patients at risk for more severe diabetic eye disease. Microalbuminuria warrants intensive monitoring of both retinal and renal status. The hemoglobin levels should be monitored regularly in diabetic patients to detect and treat anemia, thereby reducing one risk factor for DR.","None, None",,Indian Journal of Ophthalmology,,Wolters Kluwer,"0301-4738, 1998-3689","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albuminuria; Anemia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Exudates and Transudates; Female; Hemoglobins; Humans; Linear Models; Macular Edema; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index",2011,2011,,2011,59,3,207-210,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mohan, VK Ajoy; Nithyanandam, Suneetha; Idiculla, Jyothi","Mohan, VK Ajoy (Department of Ophthalmology, St John's Medical College Hospital, Bangalore - 560 034, India); Nithyanandam, Suneetha (Department of Ophthalmology, St John's Medical College Hospital, Bangalore - 560 034, India); Idiculla, Jyothi (Department of Internal Medicine, St John's Medical College Hospital, Bangalore - 560 034, India)","Nithyanandam, Suneetha (St.John's Medical College Hospital)","Mohan, VK Ajoy (St.John's Medical College Hospital); Nithyanandam, Suneetha (St.John's Medical College Hospital); Idiculla, Jyothi (St.John's Medical College Hospital)",St.John's Medical College Hospital,grid.416432.6,Bengaluru,Karnataka,India,,,,,,37,11,1.2,6.25,,https://doi.org/10.4103/0301-4738.81029,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007723575,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Prevention,Eye; Metabolic and endocrine,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,,dims

On this market banks exchange funds one another giving rise to a complex network of interbanking relations. With the tools of network analysis it is possible to study how contagion spreads between banks and what is the probability and size of a cascade (a sequence of defaults) generated by a single initial episode. These two variables are a key component to understand systemic risk and to assess the stability of the banking system. In extreme scenarios, the system may experience a phase transition when the consequences of one single initial shock affect the entire population. We show that the size and probability of a cascade evolve along the business cycle and how they respond to exogenous shocks. Financial shocks have a larger impact on contagion probability than real shocks that, however, are long lasting. Additionally we find that monetary policy faces a trade off between financial stability and macroeconomic stabilization. In particular, responding to the contagion probability reduces risk on financial markets at the cost of higher volatility of real variables. Government spending shocks, on the contrary, have smaller effects on both. Finally we analyze a set of contagion-preventing policies.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ferrari, Massimo","Ferrari, Massimo (Catholic University of Milan, Students)",,"Ferrari, Massimo ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,0.38,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102466062,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory",Mental Health,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

In this paper we study the European bank network and its vulnerability to stressing differ- ent bank assets. The importance of macro-prudential policy is emphasized by the inherent vulnerability of the financial system, high level of leverage, interconnectivity of system’s entities, similar risk exposure of financial institutions, and susceptibility for systemic crisis propagation through the system. Current stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority do not take in consideration the connectivity of the banks and the potential of one bank vulnerability spilling over to the rest of the system. We create a bipartite network with bank nodes on one hand and asset nodes on the other with weighted links between the two layers based on the level of different countries’ sovereign debt holdings by each bank. We propose a model for systemic risk propagation based on common bank exposures to specific asset classes. We introduce the similarity in asset distribution among the banks as a measure of bank closeness. We link the closeness of asset distributions to the likelihood that banks will experience a similar level and type of distress in a given adverse scenario. We analyze the dynamics of tier 1 capital ratio after stressing the bank network and find that while the system is able to withstand shocks for a wide range of parameters, we identify a critical threshold for asset risk beyond which the system transitions from stable to unstable.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2017,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Vodenska, Irena; Aoyama, Hideaki; Becker, Alexander P.; Fujiwara, Yoshi; Iyetomi, Hiroshi; Lungu, Eliza","Vodenska, Irena (Boston University Metropolitan College); Aoyama, Hideaki (GSAIS, Kyoto University); Becker, Alexander P.

METHODS: A total of 178 POAG patients (89 eyes showing at least 3 occurrences of DH and 89 age-matched control eyes with a minimum of 10 years' follow-up without DH) were included in a retrospective, case-control study. Ocular factors were evaluated by a retrospective chart review, and systemic factors were evaluated by a telephone survey. Associations between factors and recurrent DH were investigated by logistic regression analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to evaluate glaucoma progression and to identify the factors predictive of glaucoma progression.
RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis revealed the association of recurrent DH with low baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) [odds ratio (OR), 0.88; 95% confidential interval (CI), 0.80-0.98; P = 0.014], lower percentage reduction of IOP (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.020), cold extremities (OR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.03-7.60; P = 0.043), prone or lateral decubitus sleeping position (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.13-4.03; P = 0.019), and sleeping disorders (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.05-5.15; P = 0.037). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a lower percentage reduction in IOP (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00; P = 0.046) increased the risk of recurrent DH. The control group exhibited a greater cumulative probability of non-progression than the recurrent DH group (P = 0.01, by log-rank test). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model showed that recurrent DH was associated with glaucoma progression [hazard ratio (HR), 1.88; 95% CI; 1.66-3.05; P = 0.01.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the ocular and systemic factors, only lower-percentage reduction of IOP in POAG was associated with recurrent DH.

Yet, as more firms are required by regulation to act in the same way, the accuracy of those presumptions may begin to erode. The intuition is that law’s coordination function may begin to displace the randomness presumed within much of modern financial risk management. In extreme cases, I argue, uniformity can result in a significant increase in market risk. Coordination’s benefits, in those circumstances, may be offset by the negative consequences of greater uniformity. Factors beyond regulation, such as market convention, may also support greater coordination. Industry best practices can reinforce uniform conduct, and standard-form contracts can cause multiple firms to react to the same obligations in a like manner – in each case, potentially affecting the financial markets in the same way as regulation. By enhancing coordination, market participants may look to minimize transaction and other costs, but fail to account for the systemic impact of greater uniformity. The result, in either case, can be a weakening of the financial system that, in turn, affects the broader economy as firms become unable to access capital or are only able to do so at higher cost. Going forward, the benefits of financial regulation must begin to be weighed against their systemic consequences. Doing so requires new regulation to account for the potential impact of greater uniformity. Regulators, I argue, must also focus on the systemic risk posed by standardized market practices, since individual firms are unlikely to have sufficient information (or incentive) to police them themselves.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Whitehead, Charles K.","Whitehead, Charles K.

275,pub.1153535837,10.5937/ekopre2206346d,,,,Macroeconomic determinants of loan default rate in banking sector of the Republic of Serbia,"In literature, there is inconsistent view of how the size of a company affects the level of credit risk. The aim of this research is to to determine whether the exposure to systemic risk increases with the size of the borrower. Empirical analysis of the time series of loan default rates, as dependent variable, on the one hand, and macroeconomic factors, as regressors, on the other hand, is based on the error correction model. Parallel to this, a panel data analysis was applied where panel units are defined at the level of the risk segment of the loan portfolio. Research results confirm that there is statistically significant impact of macroecnomic determinants on loan default rate in banking sector of Republic of Serbia. However, in the segment of small and medium-sized enterprises, the adjustment coefficient is not statistically significant. Along with this, in the short run, there is a statistically significant negative impact of the one-quarter lagged default rate on the default rate in the SMEs segment. Based on the research results, it can be inferred that the credit risk of the SMEs segment is the most resistant to the influence of macroeconomic factors. SME are the most flexible because they are not burdened by size, and on the other hand, they are not endangered as micro businesses by the risk of concentration of one large customer and weak negotiating position in relation to creditors and suppliers.",,,Ekonomika preduzeca,,Centre for Evaluation in Education and Science (CEON/CEES),"0353-443X, 2406-1239",,2022,2022,,2022,70,5-6,346-359,All OA; Gold,Article,"Drljača-Kanazir, Svetlana","Drljača-Kanazir, Svetlana ()",,"Drljača-Kanazir, Svetlana ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0353-443X/2022/0353-443X2205346D.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153535837,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth,dims

561,pub.1122853077,10.2139/ssrn.3017446,,,,Two-Stage Learning of a Systemic Risk Factor,"Motivated by multi-dimensional sources of systemic risk in the economy and the low frequency nature of the observed empirical proxies for some of these, we propose a two-stage learning procedure to construct one better high-frequency (i.e., daily) systemic risk factor. In the first stage, we use a Kalman-Filtering approach to synthesize the information about systemic risk contained in 19 different monthly proxies for systemic risk and produce one better monthly Bayesian risk factor. The low frequency (i.e., monthly) Bayesian factor can be used to predict the cross-section of stock returns out of sample. In particular, a strategy that goes long the quintile portfolio with the highest exposure to the Bayesian factor and short the quintile portfolio with the lowest exposure to the Bayesian factor yields a Fama-French-Carhart alpha of 1.7% per month (20.4% annualized). This provides a new empirical evidence to support three mainstream models: the ICAPM, the Intermediary Asset Pricing Model, and the Disaster Risk Model. On top of the first stage, the second stage is to impute the monthly Bayesian factor and achieve our final goal of generating a high-frequency risk factor. We use the Natural Language Process technique Word Embedding to read the headlines and abstracts of all daily financial articles from the New York Times and aggregate all daily semantic and syntactic information into one 100-dimension word vector. This daily 100-dimension word vector is then used as a regressor to mimic and track the monthly Bayesian factor. The mimicking regression could then produce daily mimicking values of the monthly risk factor, which become our daily systemic risk factor. This daily text mimicking risk factor is validated in several ways including by showing how well it captures the 2008 crisis. We also find that the text mimicking risk factor is priced in the cross-section of stock returns at the daily level and can predict large swings in the VIX using a quantile regression approach, which sheds some light on the puzzling relation between the macro-economy and stock market volatility.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Wang, Wenzhi","Wang, Wenzhi (Boston College, Department of Finance)",,"Wang, Wenzhi ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122853077,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Five patients (five eyes) with triple infection keratitis were identified.
METHODS: Eyes with polymicrobial keratitis were identified from January 2002 to December 2010. Only culture-positive cases and eyes infected by three different organisms were included. Demographics, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The size of the corneal infiltrate, presence of hypopyon, pre- and post-treatment best-corrected visual acuity, antibiotic regimen and sensitivity, types of isolated pathogens, duration of infection, and treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: The mean age was 39 years (SD, ±23.4; range, 21-74). Use of topical steroids was the commonest risk factor (80%). Multiple risk factors were identified in four eyes. The average size of corneal infiltrate was 23.5 mm (SD, ±35.2; range, 2.08-85.5), and all eyes developed hypopyon. A total of 15 organisms belonging to 10 species (bacteria=7, fungi=3) were isolated. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were the most frequently isolated bacteria (n=3) and fungi (n=3), respectively. All patients had at least one type of fungal isolate. Infection resolved with medical treatment in four eyes and one eye had to be eviscerated as the patient developed panophthalmitis. The average time taken for infection to resolve was 30 days (SD, ±19.3; range, 13-61).
CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion of polymicrobial keratitis should be made in patients with multiple and systemic risk factors. Use of topical steroid was the most common risk factor. Prolonged course of disease, relatively large infiltrate, and presence of hypopyon and fungal isolates are typical features of triple infection keratitis.",,,Eye & Contact Lens Science & Clinical Practice,,Wolters Kluwer,"1542-2321, 1542-233X","Adult; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; Female; Fungi; Humans; Keratitis; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Steroids; Young Adult",2014-05,2014,,2014-05,40,3,123-126,Closed,Article,"Ray, Manotosh; Nigel, Lim Chen Siang; Tan, Anna Marie","Ray, Manotosh (Department of Ophthalmology (M.R., A.M.T.), National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore; and Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (M.R., L.C.S.N., A.M.T.), National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.); Nigel, Lim Chen Siang (Department of Ophthalmology (M.R., A.M.T.), National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore; and Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (M.R., L.C.S.N., A.M.T.), National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.); Tan, Anna Marie (Department of Ophthalmology (M.R., A.M.T.), National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore; and Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (M.R., L.C.S.N., A.M.T.), National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.)",,"Ray, Manotosh (National University Health System; National University of Singapore); Nigel, Lim Chen Siang (National University Health System; National University of Singapore); Tan, Anna Marie (National University Health System; National University of Singapore)",National University Health System; National University of Singapore,grid.410759.e; grid.4280.e,Singapore; Singapore,; ,Singapore; Singapore,,,,,,12,4,0.65,2.39,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051798516,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Infectious Diseases,Eye; Infection,2.2 Factors relating to the physical environment; 6.1 Pharmaceuticals,,,A05 Biological Sciences,,dims
591,pub.1100588982,10.1155/2018/8767836,,,,The Assessment of Systemic Risk in the Kenyan Banking Sector,"The present paper aims to assess the systemic risk of the Kenyan banking system. We propose a theoretical framework to reveal the time evolution of the systemic risk using sequences of financial data and use the framework to assess the systemic risk of the Kenyan banking system that is regarded as the largest in the East and Central African region. Firstly, we estimate the bilateral exposures matrix using aggregate financial data on loans and deposits from annual reports and analyze the interconnectedness in the market using network centrality measures. Next, we extend the Eisenberg–Noe method to a multiperiod setting to the systemic risk of the Kenyan banking system, in which the multiperiod includes the dynamic evolutions of the Kenyan banking system of every bank and the structure of the interbank network system. We apply this framework to assess dynamically the systemic risk of the Kenyan banking system between 2009 and 2015. The main findings are the following. The theoretical network analysis using network centrality measures showed several banks displaying characteristics of systematically important banks (SIBs). The theoretical default analysis showed that a bank suffering a basic default will trigger a contagious default that caused several other banks in the sector to go bankrupt. Further stress test proved that the KCB bank theoretically caused a few contagious defaults due to an unusually high interconnectedness. This methodology can contribute by being part of monitoring system of the Central Bank of Kenya (regulatory body) as well as the implementation of policies (such as bank-internal stress tests) that assist in preventing default contagion.",The authors acknowledge the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant no. 71371046.,,Complexity,,Hindawi,"1076-2787, 1099-0526",,2018,2018,,2018,2018,,1-15,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fan, Hong; Amalia, Allan Alvin Lee Lukaya; Gao, Qian Qian","Fan, Hong (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai 200051, China); Amalia, Allan Alvin Lee Lukaya (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai 200051, China); Gao, Qian Qian (Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai 200051, China)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University)","Fan, Hong (Donghua University); Amalia, Allan Alvin Lee Lukaya (Donghua University); Gao, Qian Qian (Donghua University)",Donghua University,grid.255169.c,Shanghai,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.8319441,71371046,6,3,,,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/8767836.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100588982,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

One original aspect of our paper is the estimation of probabilities of default, in conjunction with the CIMDO method (Consistent Information Multivariate Density Optimizing) and the use of clustering techniques. We find that most of the banks have a very low probability of default, but there is a high joint probability of default for most pairs of banks. Therefore, there are seeds of systemic risk in the WAEMU: if the financial strength of large banking groups deteriorates, there could be contagion effects that could weaken the union. The use of quantile estimation has helped to determine banks’ characteristics that may explain the systemic risk.","We would like to thank the Editor and the two referees of the Journal, Ahmad Hassan Ahmad and Christine Oughton.

202,pub.1102461498,10.2139/ssrn.2779908,,,,Corporate Finance,"In this Breadth component, an analysis of capital budgeting, portfolio investments, risk management, optimization, financial planning, mergers, acquisitions, and corporate governance is put forth. A compare and contrast is performed for each of the mentioned theories in corporate finance. This component will include a discussion of how these theories contribute to better performance from a corporate financial perspective. Influential writers from each theory, as to the role that contemporary corporate finance plays in promoting performance, is part of the analysis. Capital budgeting is important for corporations due to the many project choices that managers have to choose from. Stowe and Gagne (2009) proposed six basic principles that decision makers should consider when evaluating projects for their firms to invest into. In the context of portfolio investments Monk and Lajoux (2011) is explored to investigate the three types of valuation models, nine types of assets, and how to assess asset quality. Risk management is an important theory in reducing sensitivity to volatile financial markets. Risk management is probed based on research from Gregoriou, Hoppe, and Wehn (2010) pertaining to wavelet analysis and the credit default swaps. In the study of wavelets a researcher can decouple a dataset between high and low frequency components, allowing for understanding of system dynamics. Regarding credit default swaps and carry trades, a portfolio manager can use these indicators to understand global system risks. Value-at-Risk models by Gregoriou, Hoppe, and Wehn (2010) is put forward to determine the usefulness of such risk metrics and some of the pitfalls that a portfolio might encounter. Optimizing investments, especially portfolios susceptible to interest rate risk, is very important to manage. This can be accomplished by models proposed in Zenios (1993) using factoring hedging. With any survey of corporate finance theory a discussion on the history of merger and acquisitions is important to explore and this is accomplished via the research from Gaughan (2011). When analyzing corporate governance Tirole (2008) is cited to discuss some of the contemporary problems at firms and how those problems can result into systemic risks. In the conclusion section an important question was examined: Why do fundamental analysis, risk management strategies, and knowledge of agency problem still lead to system failure? It’s within the intent of this Breadth component to answer this important question by using different theories of corporate finance pertaining to the categories of capital budgeting, portfolio investments, risk management, optimization, financial planning, mergers, acquisitions, and corporate governance.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Cottrell, Paul","Cottrell, Paul (Harvard University, Students)",,"Cottrell, Paul (Harvard University)",Harvard University,grid.38142.3c,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,2,1,,0.75,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102461498,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: This case offers further insights into a rare but vision-threatening and potentially life-threatening diagnosis. In conjunction with aggressive local and systemic treatment, tectonic lamellar keratoplasty provides good therapeutic and tectonic results for scleral necrosis after strabismus surgery. This case also demonstrates the importance of screening for associated systemic risk factors in any patient with scleritis for appropriate, targeted therapy.",None.,No funding or grant support.,American Journal of Ophthalmology Case Reports,,Elsevier,2451-9936,,2018-05-01,2018,2018-05-01,2018-09,11,,28-31,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ram, Radha","Ram, Radha (Texan Eye, 1700 S Mopac, Austin, TX, USA)","Ram, Radha (Texan Eye)","Ram, Radha (Texan Eye)",Texan Eye,grid.478029.0,Austin,Texas,United States,,,,,,8,3,1.21,2.88,1.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajoc.2018.04.025,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103692304,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry; 42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science,Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision,Eye,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

We examined the relationship between epistemic cultures in citizen science projects and learning potential related to matters of concern. We then developed a typology of purposes and a citizen science epistemic-cultures heuristic and mapped 56 projects in southern Africa using this framework. The purpose typology represents the range of knowledge-production purposes, ranging from laboratory science to social learning, whereas the epistemic-cultures typology is a relational representation of scientist and citizen participation and their approach to knowledge production. Results showed an iterative relationship between matters of fact and matters of concern across the projects; the nexus of citizens' engagement in knowledge-production activities varied. The knowledge-production purposes informed and shaped the epistemic cultures of all the sampled citizen science projects, which in turn influenced the potential for learning within each project. Through a historical review of 3 phases in a long-term river health-monitoring project, we found that it is possible to evolve the learning curve of citizen science projects. This evolution involved the development of scientific water monitoring tools, the parallel development of pedagogic practices supporting monitoring activities, and situated engagement around matters of concern within social activism leading to learning-led change. We conclude that such evolutionary processes serve to increase potential for learning and are necessary if citizen science is to contribute to wider restructuring of the epistemic culture of science under conditions of expanding social-ecological risk.","This study was partially supported by a scholarship grant from the Culture, Arts, Tourism, Hospitality and Sports Sector Education and Training Authority in South Africa.",,Conservation Biology,,Wiley,"0888-8892, 1523-1739","Africa, Southern; Community Participation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Learning; Risk; Social Environment",2016-04-25,2016,2016-04-25,2016-06,30,3,540-549,Closed,Article,"Vallabh, Priya; Lotz-Sisitka, Heila; O'Donoghue, Rob; Schudel, Ingrid","Vallabh, Priya (Environmental Learning Research Centre, Rhodes University, P.O.

203,pub.1102292510,10.2139/ssrn.1675015,,,,Bail-Ins Versus Bail-Outs: Using Contingent Capital to Mitigate Systemic Risk,"Because the quickest, simplest way for a financial institution to increase its profitability is to increase its leverage, an enduring tension will exist between regulators and systemically significant financial institutions over the issues of risk and leverage. Many have suggested that the 2008 financial crisis was caused because financial institutions were induced to increase leverage because of flawed systems of executive compensation. Still, there is growing evidence that shareholders acquiesced in these compensation formulas to cause managers to accept higher risk and leverage. Shareholder pressure then is a factor that could induce the failure of a systemically significant financial institution. What then can be done to prevent future such failures? The Dodd-Frank Act invests heavily in preventive control and regulatory oversight, but this paper argues that the political economy of financial regulation ensures that there will be an eventual relaxation of regulatory oversight (“the regulatory sine curve”). Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly reduces the ability of financial regulators to effect a bail-out of a distressed financial institution and largely compels them to subject such an institution to a forced receivership and liquidation under the auspices of the FDIC. Believing that there is a superior and feasible alternative to forcing a strained, but not insolvent, financial institution into a liquidation, this paper recommends a system of “contingent capital” under which, at predefined points, a significant percentage of a major financial institution’s debt securities would convert into an equity security. However, unlike earlier proposals for contingent capital, the conversion would be to a senior, non-convertible preferred stock with cumulative dividends and voting rights. The intent of this provision is to create a class of voting shareholders who would be rationally risk averse and would resist common shareholder pressure for increased leverage and risk-taking, but who would obtain voting rights only at the late stage when the financial institution enters the “vicinity of insolvency.” This paper discusses (i) the possible design of such a security, (ii) the recent experience in Europe with issuances of similar securities, (iii) tax and other obstacles, (iv) the possibility of international convergence on a system of contingent capital, and (v) the existing authority of the Federal Reserve Board to implement such a requirement. It submits that contingent capital is an idea whose time is coming, but whose optimal design remains debatable.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Coffee, John C.","Coffee, John C.

It uses the average of the percentile ranking of three widely used measures of systemic risk of a firm to calculate a single systemic risk index (SRI) for the firm. It then uses the SRI to identify systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and non-financial institutions (SINFIs) among 50 largest Indian firms, in each quarter from 2000 to 2012.

A number of important development conclusions emerge from the paper. There exists little relationship between incomes and levels of FDI participation, although developed and resource-endowed economies have received greater inflows. While greater liberalization from the mid-1980s has stimulated the explosive growth of portfolio equity capital flows, it has also exposed developing economies to serious systemic risks. Contrary to neoliberal arguments, developing economies that have managed to utilize FDI effectively and to prevent systemic volatility generated from portfolio capital movements from seriously destabilizing them, have generally relied on effective governments.

In this paper, an infrastructure is proposed to address the need for a new information system in systemic regulation.   Design/methodology/approach The proposed infrastructure is developed using the Fed's Bank Holding Company Supervision Manual as a guideline. The model uses a data fusion approach that allows integration of inspection data, external data, and other regulatory data of different granularity. A proprietary application known as Decision Making Toolbox (DMT) is being developed with three‐tier architecture.   Findings The integrated all‐in‐one approach will enhance the efficiency, scope, and quality of studies applied to systemic regulation and will facilitate easy decision making for effective regulation.

256,pub.1142623094,10.2139/ssrn.886047,,,,The Developing EU Legal Framework for Clearing and Settlement of Financial Instruments,"Traditionally, clearing and settlement of financial instruments has not been the focus of general attention, even though it is at the heart of any financial system. The ongoing integration of financial markets, and in particular the process of creating a single market for financial services in the European Union (EU), has put in the spotlight the importance of clearing and settlement. Weaknesses in the clearing and settlement infrastructure can have serious consequences for the financial sector as a whole. In view of this, the European Commission has given high priority to removing the barriers to efficient cross-border clearing and settlement in the single market. Clearing and settlement depends to a large extent on the legal infrastructure on which it is built. Clear and effective legal rules are a prerequisite for building market confidence, fostering investor protection and limiting and managing systemic risk. A modern and efficient legal framework in the EU will not only enhance the safety, soundness and efficiency of the clearing and settlement of financial instruments, it will also promote the further integration and competitiveness of European financial markets. This paper presents and evaluates the existing EU legislative framework. Furthermore, the paper describes current EU initiatives to remove barriers to efficient clearing and settlement, with a specific focus on the legal aspects and, in particular, on the activities of the Legal Certainty Group. Finally, it compares the European initiatives with parallel efforts to harmonise laws on a global scale and gives an outlook as to how the acquis communautaire could evolve in the short to medium term.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2006,2006,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Löber, Klaus","Löber, Klaus (European Central Bank (ECB) - Directorate General Legal Services)",,"Löber, Klaus ()",,,,,,,,,,,2,0,,0.5,,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142623094,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies",,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

At least two of these microorganisms, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, also invade the periodontal tissue and are virulent organisms. Initiation and progression of periodontal infections are clearly modified by local and systemic conditions called risk factors. The local factors include pre-existing disease as evidenced by deep probing depths and plaque retention areas associated with defective restorations. Systemic risk factors recently have been identified by large epidemiologic studies using multifactorial statistical analyses to correct for confounding or associated co-risk factors. Risk factors which we know today as important include diabetes mellitus, especially in individuals in whom metabolic control is poor, and cigarette smoking. These two risk factors markedly affect the initiation and progression of periodontitis, and attempts to manage these factors are now an important component of prevention and treatment of adult periodontitis. Systemic conditions associated with reduced neutrophil numbers or function are also important risk factors in children, juveniles, and young adults. Diseases in which neutrophil dysfunction occurs include the lazy leukocyte syndrome associated with localized juvenile periodontitis, cyclic neutropenia, and congenital neutropenia. Recent studies also point to several potentially important periodontal risk indicators. These include stress and coping behaviors, and osteopenia associated with estrogen deficiency. There are also background determinants associated with periodontal disease including gender (with males having more disease), age (with more disease seen in the elderly), and hereditary factors. The study of risk in periodontal disease is a rapidly emerging field and much is yet to be learned. However, there are at least two significant risk factors-smoking and diabetes-which demand attention in current management of periodontal disease.",,,Journal of Periodontology,,Wiley,"0022-3492, 1943-3670",Actinobacillus Infections; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; Bacteroidaceae Infections; Child; Dental Plaque; Diabetes Complications; Disease Progression; Epidemiologic Methods; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Neutropenia; Neutrophils; Periodontal Diseases; Periodontal Pocket; Periodontitis; Periodontium; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Smoking; Virulence,1996-10-01,1996,1996-10-01,1996-10,67,10 Suppl,1041-1049,Closed,Article,"Genco, R J","Genco, R J (Department of Oral Biology, School of Dental Medicine, State University of New York, Buffalo, USA.)",,"Genco, R J (University at Buffalo, State University of New York)","University at Buffalo, State University of New York",grid.273335.3,Buffalo,New York,United States,,,,,,466,29,9.45,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068733302,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Diabetes; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention,,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims
523,pub.1014016785,10.1002/isaf.295,,,,A network model of systemic risk: stress testing the banking system1,"Although there are many definitions of systemic risk, most agree that it manifests itself by an initial shock that results in the failure of one or more banks and then spreads out to the entire system by a contagion mechanism which can result in the failure of more banks in the system. Assuming that bank failures in the initial shock are randomly dependent on the failure probabilities of the individual banks and that the ensuing contagion process is deterministic, depending on interbank exposures, in this paper we propose a network model to analyse systemic risk in the banking system that, in contrast to other proposed models, seeks to obtain the probability distribution of losses for the financial system resulting from the shock/contagion process. Thus, calculating the probabilities of joint failures by simulation and assuming that the matrix of bilateral interbank exposures is known, we represent systemic risk in the financial system by means of a graph and use discrete modelling techniques to characterize the dynamics of contagion and corresponding losses within the network. The probability distribution of losses, risk profile for the Mexican banking system, is obtained through an efficient, complete enumeration procedure of all possible bank default events in the system. This, in turn, allows the use of the wide variety of well‐established risk measures to describe the fragility of the financial system. Additionally, the model allows us to perform stress tests along both the bank default probabilities and the interbank exposures and is used to assess the risk of the Mexican banking system.

This paper empirically re-investigates the relationship between competition and bank risk across a large sample of European listed banks over the period 2004–2013. However, in contrast to most extant literature, we consider both individual and systemic dimensions of risk. Bank-individual risk is measured by the Z-score and the distance-to-default, while we consider the SRISK as a proxy for bank systemic risk. Using the Lerner index as an inverse measure of competition and after controlling for a variety of bank-specific and macroeconomic factors, our results suggest that competition encourages bank risk-taking and then increases individual bank fragility. This result is in line with the traditional “competition-fragility” view. Our most important findings concern the relationship between competition and systemic risk. Indeed, contrary to our previous results, we find that competition enhances financial stability by decreasing systemic risk. This result can be explained by the fact that weak competition tends to increase the correlation in the risk-taking behavior of banks.",,,Journal of International Financial Markets Institutions and Money,,Elsevier,"1042-4431, 1873-0612",,2017-01,2017,,2017-01,46,,199-215,Closed,Article,"Leroy, Aurélien; Lucotte, Yannick","Leroy, Aurélien (LEMNA, University of Nantes, IEMN–IAE, Chemin de la Censive du Tertre, BP 52231, 44322 Nantes, France); Lucotte, Yannick (PSB Paris School of Business, Department of Economics, 59 rue Nationale, 75013 Paris, France)","Leroy, Aurélien (University of Nantes)","Leroy, Aurélien (University of Nantes); Lucotte, Yannick (Paris School of Business)",Paris School of Business; University of Nantes,grid.469042.d; grid.4817.a,Paris; Nantes,; ,France; France,,,,,,108,56,,46.34,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039464005,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This entirely automatic process is updated weekly on a dedicated website, and refreshable on-demand. A large set of stand-alone and systemic risk indicators are computed and reduced to fewer representative factors through dimensionality reduction. These factors are set as features for an adjusted version of a nested k-means algorithm that handles missing data. The obtained individual banks’ multi-dimensional clustering results are also aggregated per country and region. Although this procedure is designed to be editable regarding the number of banks and indicators, an empirical analysis is presented based on 161 listed banks and 85 indicators reduced to 11 main factors during the 2004-2021 period. The analysis underlines the importance of paying a particular attention to the ambiguous impact of banks’ size on systemic measures.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Mercadier, Mathieu; Tarazi, Amine; Armand, Paul; Lardy, Jean-Pierre","Mercadier, Mathieu (); Tarazi, Amine (University of Limoges - Laboratoire d'Analyse et de Prospectives Économiques (LAPE); University of Limoges - Faculty of Law and Economic Science); Armand, Paul (); Lardy, Jean-Pierre (JPLCSASU)",,"Mercadier, Mathieu (); Tarazi, Amine (University of Limoges); Armand, Paul (); Lardy, Jean-Pierre ()",University of Limoges,grid.9966.0,Limoges,,France,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143859263,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

431,pub.1147065947,10.2139/ssrn.4053890,,,,Systemically Important Technology,"The debate about how to address dangers in the increasingly important technology sector misses an essential dimension. It is the same oversight that financial regulators committed prior to the Global Financial Crisis: under-appreciating systemic risk. Fortunately, the responses those regulators eventually developed provide a template to avoid a similar disaster in tech. The financial regulation paradigm for systemically important institutions can usefully be applied our current technological environment in a way that could promote stability and resilience. In particular, we propose two steps. First, technology regulators should designate firms of systemic importance, using a set of factors modeled on those established under Dodd-Frank for financial institutions. Second, we propose that technology regulators join a council that meets regularly to discuss and identify issues of systemic risk in technology, along the lines of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.Our proposal offers a number of advantages over the current system. It consolidates a balkanized regulatory landscape and rationalizes a regulatory mission. It offers a different perspective on technology regulation, one that addresses real problems that have—so far—bedeviled both important technology firms and their government minders. It takes the best features of a successful resilience regime and adapts them to a critical part of the economy, in a way that should appeal across the political spectrum.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Werbach, Kevin; Zaring, David T.","Werbach, Kevin (University of Pennsylvania, The Wharton School, Legal Studies & Business Ethics Department); Zaring, David T.

Systemic risk factors of extensor pollicis longus tendon rupture in distal radius fracture were investigated. We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients of extensor pollicis longus tendon rupture after distal radius fracture from February 2010 to March 2016. Three times more patients for the control group with matched sex, age and type of fracture without extensor pollicis longus tendon rupture were chosen during the same period. We statistically analyzed systemic risk factors of spontaneous tendon rupture, such as low bodyweight, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, systemic steroid use, local steroid injection around wrist, quinolone, and statins. The incidence of extensor pollicis longus tendon rupture was significantly higher in the group of steroid use than in the control group. The use of steroid in patient with distal radius fracture may be a potential risk factor for extensor pollicis longus tendon rupture. Local steroid injection is not statistically related to extensor pollicis tendon rupture.

It provides insight into how the digital finance system actually works in a socioeconomic context. It presents three key messages: that digital transformation will change the financial system entirely, that the State has a particularly important role to play in the whole process and that consumers will be offered more opportunities and freedom but simultaneously will be exposed to more risk and challenges. The book is divided into four parts. It begins by laying down the fundamentals of the subsequent analysis and offers a deep understanding of digital finance, including a topology of the key technologies applied in the transformation process. The next part reviews the challenges facing the digital State in the new reality, the digitalization of public finance and the development of digitally relevant taxation systems. In the third part, digital consumer aspects are discussed. The final part examines the risks and challenges of digital finance. The authors focus their attention on three key developments in financial markets: accelerated growth in terms of the importance of algorithms, replacing existing legal regulations; the expansion of cyber risk and its growing impact and finally the emergence of new dimensions of systemic risk as a side effect of financial digitalization. The authors supplement the analysis with a discussion of how these new risks and challenges are monitored and mitigated by financial supervision.

In its first year, the European Systemic Cyber Group (ESCG) sought to develop a shared understanding of Common Individual Vulnerabilities (CIVs) across ESRB members, and to identify the unique characteristics of cyber risk that could contribute to a systemic event. Building on this work, this paper describes a conceptual model for systemic cyber risk, and aims to:•provide a structured approach that can be used to describe cyber incidents, from genesis through to a potential systemic event;•demonstrate the link between the crystallisation of cyber risk in a firm-specific context(portraying microprudential concerns), and the possible ramifications for the financial system (applying a macroprudential focus);•identify system-wide vulnerabilities and the unique characteristics of cyber incidents which can act as amplifiers, thereby propagating shocks through the financial system;•support the use of historical or theoretical scenario-based analysis to demonstrate the viability of the model;•suggest system-wide interventions that could act as systemic mitigants.Although the model is geared towards disruption arising from cyber incidents, it can also be used for any source of operational disruption (although some elements of the model may be less relevant).",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ros, Greg","Ros, Greg (Bank of England)",,"Ros, Greg (Bank of England)",Bank of England,grid.465255.5,London,,United Kingdom,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/238320/1/esrb-op16.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142655140,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The default contagion and loss amplification due to network linkage measure the systemic risk, from which we can ascertain the potential impact of CoCo bonds on systemic risk. Results show that CoCo bonds enhance the spillover effect of issuer’s default; in the meanwhile, sufficient CoCo bonds partly offset the impact of default contagion from other institutions. In addition, CoCo bonds enhance the amplification effect of loss due to network linkage, but the amplification effect diminishes after considering the bankruptcy cost.

370,pub.1006440192,10.1111/jacf.12175,,,,Integrating Systemic Risk into Modern Portfolio Theory and Practice,"Conventional wisdom holds that the performance of investment managers should be measured against some broad market index such as the S&P 500. The broad market averages provide a useful benchmark because they are assumed to be beyond the influence of investment managers and provide a way of capturing what financial economists call “systematic risk,” which is the part of total risk that cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. But one clear limitation of such an approach to performance evaluation is that by focusing on risks and rewards at the portfolio level only, it fails to consider risks and rewards at a systemic level, where the performance of all portfolios is increasingly likely to be affected. The author begins by making the case that the performance evaluation and collective decision‐making of investment managers could have the effect of increasing the level of systematic risk in both the markets and the real economy. Then, after suggesting that the strength or weakness of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks can have substantial effects on overall market returns, he discusses a number of efforts currently underway to integrate ESG factors into portfolio‐level decision‐making. The author closes by urging asset owners to take the following three steps to help bridge the gap between investment decision‐making and ESG consequences: (1) acknowledge the connection between investment decision‐making and systems‐level risks and rewards; (2) determine which systemic frameworks are most appropriate and useful for their purposes; and (3) implement investment practices that allow them to manage systemic‐level risks and rewards while simultaneously achieving competitive financial returns in their portfolios. With the help of new measurement and management tools, asset owners can strengthen systemic frameworks, communicate the importance of ESG performance to their investees and investors, and align their efforts with those of governmental and non‐governmental organizations to limit systemic risk.",,,Journal of Applied Corporate Finance,,,"1078-1196, 1745-6622",,2016-07-11,2016,2016-07-11,,28,2,56-61,Closed,Article,"Lydenberg, Steve","Lydenberg, Steve (STEVE LYDENBERG is the Founder and CEO of The Investment Integration Project.

The rapid spread of liquidity crisis in the interconnected financial markets, so financial institutions took excessive risks and collapsed. Then the final liquidity risk evolved into systemic risk. Firstly, this paper studies the development history and the latest progress of systematic risk management, the theory of liquidity risk management and the theory of risk-taking behavior management. The paper constructed two dynamic Division number regression to measures ΔCoVaR of 16 commercial banks. Then the dynamic panel regression model is built, which takes the liquidity risk index of individual commercial bank and the interaction between individual commercial bank liquidity risk index and risk-taking index as the main explanatory variables to analyze the banking systemic risk. The research finds that the greater the liquidity risk of individual commercial banks, the higher the contribution of their systemic risk. The risk-taking of individual commercial bank can play an effective role in regulating and weakening its ΔCoVaR. In addition, the large size of the bank does not mean that the greater the contribution of its systemic risk. In terms of liquidity risk regulation, banks would better use liquidity creation indicators and liquidity ratios, rather than loan-to-deposit ratios.

In its original design, there is a possibility that the CCP may go default, and thus jeopardizing the stability of the financial system. In order to address this issue, we propose a New Central Clearing Counterparty (NCCP) design. In our model, banks with positive cash balance are always able to stop the fire sales and help the troubled banks in the system. The rescue process leads to benefits for all banks in the long run and many banks also have incentives to do so even from the perspective of short term benefits. We measure the effects of default from both the default loss and the liquidation loss. The liquidation loss not only affects the banks who are going to do the fire sale, but also leads to a decrease on the net worth of solvent banks.

The main theme of the Report is the importance of containing systemic risk and maintaining close oversight of “systemically important” financial institutions. The Report's recommendations concerning money market funds are based on the misconceptions that money funds are bank-like, pose systemic risk, are not adequately regulated, and enjoy unfair competitive advantages over banks. The Report would apply inappropriate bank-like regulation to money fund operations without any analysis of the consequences.

They serve as network-proxies for measuring the robustness of the global financial system and the interdependence of financial markets, respectively. Two early-warning indicators for financial crises are identified: First, the algebraic connectivity of the equity securities network, as a measure for structural robustness, drops close to zero already in 2005, while there is an over-representation of high-degree off-shore financial centres among the countries most-related to this observation, suggesting an investigation of such nodes with respect to the structural stability of the global financial system. Second, using a phenomenological model, the edge density of the debt securities network is found to describe and even forecast, the proliferation of several over-the-counter-traded financial derivatives, most prominently credit default swaps, enabling one to detect potentially dangerous levels of market interdependence and systemic risk.","This research was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council under the GRF Grant CityU1109/12.

The problem is largely entitled to financial risks along with technology risk, policy risk, and regulatory risk, but do not disclose climate-related financial risk which has compounded the problem further. The objective of this study is to asses investors’ perceived risk while investing renewable energy projects and disclosure of such risks. Does climate risks are included and disclosed to financial institutions while investing to make project bankable and credible. Though several mechanisms developed over a time to mitigate financial and non-financial risks, the achievement is far below expectations. It is also found that there is a limited literature available on disclosure of climate-related financial risks and its mitigation measures in this sector. As a result, business and organizations in this sector are exposed to climate risks; its prolonged effect can generate systemic risk that can hinder economic growth. Therefore, this study proposes a climate risk assessment tool to disclose climate-related financial risks information along the supply chain of the project with other identified risks for investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders. Thereby, financial markets are in a better position to respond and manage climate-related risks.

The d-SRI increases on average several years before the onset of systemic financial crises, and its early warning properties for euro area countries are superior to those of the total credit-to-GDP gap. In addition, the level of the d-SRI around the start of financial crises is highly correlated with measures of subsequent crisis severity, such as GDP declines. Model estimates suggest that the d-SRI has significant predictive power for large declines in real GDP growth three to four years down the line, as it precedes shifts in the entire distribution of future real GDP growth and especially of its left tail. The d-SRI therefore provides useful information about both the probability and the likely cost of systemic financial crises many years in advance.

The 2008 financial crisis proved that MMFs are a source of considerable instability to the global financial system, and highlighted their susceptibility to runs. The shareholders’ incentive to redeem their shares before others do when there is a perception that the MMFs might suffer a loss makes MMFs vulnerable to runs. Given this reality, the article argues that the emphasis of the financial regulators on achieving the stability of the entire financial system after the 2008 financial crisis necessitates the strictness of the new reforms. Divided into six parts, the article outlines the attributes and classification of MMFs, the definition of financial stability, and the run and systemic risk posed by MMFs during the financial crisis, before assessing the MMFs’ reforms in the US and the EU and the impacts of these reforms on the MMFs industry and global financial stability system. The major component of the US reform is the introduction of the floating net asset value (FNAV), where an MMF’s share price will fluctuate to reflect the daily market value of the fund assets. In the EU the new regulation provides investors with a high degree of optionality for investing by introducing Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) MMFs. The article concludes that despite that, the reforms are likely to jeopardize the viability of some categories of MMFs, they enhance global financial stability, and the complexity of the reforms has made MMFs more appropriate products to financial institutions’ investors than retail investors.

While the change in business models is a global phenomenon, it is more pronounced in countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K. In this study, we examine whether market structure can help explain the cross-country variation in the diversification activities that bank choose to pursue. The UK Independent Commission of Banking raised issues related to “ring fencing retail banking from investment banking. The EU’s Liikanen Review and the Dodd-Frank Act in the US proposed policies which may limit trading and proprietary activities of large banks. It is important to understand the motivation behind these choices because non-traditional banking activities have shouldered a large part of the blame for the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and now face the brunt of regulatory efforts. Using a sample of large banks across 38 countries this paper examines how the concentration of the banking system impacts the choice of business activities and consequently the stability of banks. We show that banks in less concentrated banking systems ( such as in the US and Japan) have higher levels of non-traditional business activities with higher shareholder returns, but at a cost of increased systemic risk. In contrast, the non-traditional business activities in highly concentrated banking systems help reduce the volatility of profits and also increase banks stability. Unlike previous research we show that there is not always a one-to-one relationship between non-traditional business activities and global banks stability.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Engle, Robert F.; Moshirian, Fariborz; Sahgal, Sidharth; Zhang, Bohui","Engle, Robert F.

The current European supervisory structure for financial markets represents a major development in European supervisory history. Its operation however has to be explored and analysed critically. Has it gone far enough to provide a sufficiently comprehensive and resilient system to reduce or mitigate systemic risks and handle financial crises? Some claim it has gone too far already. Fresh and rigorous critical legal and economic analysis from an independent scholarly perspective are needed to assess whether the institutional design of the European supervisory architecture has proved itself to be an efficient and effective model.

Second, it could focus on strengthening the financial system as a whole by reducing the probability of large-scale cascading events. This can be achieved by re-shaping the topology of financial networks. We use an agent-based model of a financial system and the real economy to study and compare the consequences of these two options. By conducting three computer experiments with the agent-based model we find that re-shaping financial networks is more effective and efficient than reducing financial fragility. Capital surcharges for G-SIBs could reduce systemic risk, but they would have to be substantially larger than those specified in the current Basel III proposal in order to have a measurable impact. This would cause a loss of efficiency.","We acknowledge financial support from EC FP7 projects CRISIS, agreement no. 288501 (65%), LASAGNE, agreement no. 318132 (15%) and MULTIPLEX, agreement no. 317532 (20%).",,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,,Elsevier,"0165-1889, 1879-1743",,2017-04,2017,,2017-04,77,,230-246,All OA; Green,Article,"Poledna, Sebastian; Bochmann, Olaf; Thurner, Stefan","Poledna, Sebastian (IIASA, Schlossplatz 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; Section for Science of Complex Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090, Austria); Bochmann, Olaf (Institute of New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, Eagle House, Walton Well Rd., Oxford OX2 3ED, UK; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Woodstock Rd., Oxford OX2 6GG, UK); Thurner, Stefan (Section for Science of Complex Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Spitalgasse 23, 1090, Austria; Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Hyde Park Road, Santa Fe, NM 87501, USA; IIASA, Schlossplatz 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; Complexity Science Hub Vienna, Josefstädter Straße 39, 1080 Vienna, Austria)","Thurner, Stefan (Medical University of Vienna; Santa Fe Institute; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; Complexity Science Hub Vienna)","Poledna, Sebastian (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; Medical University of Vienna); Bochmann, Olaf (University of Oxford; University of Oxford); Thurner, Stefan (Medical University of Vienna; Santa Fe Institute; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; Complexity Science Hub Vienna)",Complexity Science Hub Vienna; University of Oxford; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; Santa Fe Institute; Medical University of Vienna,grid.484678.1; grid.4991.5; grid.75276.31; grid.209665.e; grid.22937.3d,Vienna; Oxford; Laxenburg; Santa Fe; Vienna,; Oxfordshire; ; New Mexico; ,Austria; United Kingdom; Austria; United States; Austria,European Commission,cOAlition S; EC & ERC - European Union,Belgium,grant.3787262; grant.3791124; grant.3800087,288501; 317532; 318132,24,10,,10.3,39.0,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/14429/1/Basel%20III%20capital%20surcharges%20.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084087248,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Cognitive and operational models in economics and business are questioned. There is a specter of much lower economic growth in the industrialized world. Central banks are over-burdened. This makes central bankers’ lives much more complicated and obfuscates the boundaries between monetary policy and fiscal policy, especially when financial stability gets to center stage. New systemic risks show up in capital markets. The eurozone has escaped collapse owing to the European Central Bank’s extraordinary operations and large macro-imbalance corrections in its periphery, but major threats persist. This paper focuses on economic cycles and policies in an international (European) context. Attention is paid to linkages between domestic cycles and the European financial cycle, drivers of financial cycles, finance deregulation and systemic risks, ultra-low interest rates, the international policy regime, and global stability.

The aim of this investigation is to improve the understanding of the effects of national initiatives for crisis fighting taken to prevent systemic risk. Using a stratified sample of 738 Cypriote citizens, we conducted an investigation in Cyprus in the spring of 2013 when the country was facing a bank crisis. At that point in time, the Cypriote Government had imposed capital controls to prevent a bank run. We find that decision theory variables alone have low explanatory value on laypeople’s risk perception, and that laypeople’s risk perception in this situation is affected primarily by psychometric variables.

This increase is driven by a decline in the banks’ market value of equity, an increase in the systematic risk of bank returns, and an increase in the Value-at-Risk of banks. We then discuss the underlying mechanisms behind our findings.

To assess potential systemic risk concerns arising from the high concentration of the economy in large business groups and a few export-oriented sectors, we perform three levels of estimation using individual stocks, business groups, and industry returns. Our results show that the measures perform well over our sample period by indicating heightened levels of commonality and interconnectedness during crisis periods. In out-of-sample tests, we show that the measures can predict future losses in the stock market during the crises. We also provide the recent readings of our measures, both at the market, chaebol, and industry levels. The measures indicate systemic risk is currently not a major concern in Korea, as they tend to be at the lowest level since 1998. Systemic risk within-chaebols or within-industries overall has not significantly increased in the recent sub-period. In contrast, commonality within the finance industry has not subsided, which we interpret as capturing the interconnectedness endemic to the finance industry, rather than indicating a heightened systemic risk within the banking sector.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Choi, Jaewon; Lee, Jieun","Choi, Jaewon (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - Department of Finance); Lee, Jieun (The Bank of Korea; Bank of Korea - Economic Research Institute)",,"Choi, Jaewon (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign); Lee, Jieun ()",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,grid.35403.31,Urbana,Illinois,United States,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,http://papers.bok.or.kr/RePEc_attach/wpaper/english/wp-2020-8.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125995640,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

320,pub.1102393880,10.2139/ssrn.2359584,,,,Occupy Pennsylvania Avenue: How Politicians Caused the Financial Crisis and Why Their Reforms Failed,"This summary policy analysis provides a simple diagnosis of the sub-prime lending debacle and consequent systemic financial crisis: The Fed fueled an asset bubble, housing policy steered it to housing, and the extreme leverage required to fund political housing policy magnified losses instead of profits. The financial sector bailout, housing market and homeowner bailout, and fiscal and monetary stimulus were all more of the same. A financial sector meltdown was avoided, but at the expense of greater systemic risk prospectively. The Great Recession ended, but the recovery remains weak with economic costs in the aftermath many multiples those during the lending bubble and prospective economic risks are worse still. The only relevant economic precept is the original – incentives matter. Understanding the financial crisis requires no more than an explanation of how politicians perverted them. The simple prescription to avoid future systemic financial crises is to limit discretionary monetary policy, separate subsidy from finance, impose appropriate capital requirements, improve political oversight and re-introduce market discipline, the opposite of the Dodd-Frank legislation.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2013,2013,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Villani, Kevin","Villani, Kevin (University of San Diego)",,"Villani, Kevin (University of San Diego)",University of San Diego,grid.267102.0,San Diego,California,United States,,,,,,1,0,,0.35,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102393880,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration",,,,,,C19 Politics and International Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims
616,pub.1147533874,10.2139/ssrn.4097408,,,,Economic Policy Uncertainty and Bank Systemic Risk: A Cross-Country Analysis,"We examine the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on systemic risk. Based on a large sample of 889 listed banks from 20 countries, we provide empirical evidence that banks are more likely to contribute more to systemic risk when EPU increases. The effect operates through the bank leverage risk and bank asset risk channels. Further analyses reveal that some formal bank regulations (e.g., the regulatory environment) and informal institutions (e.g., culture) can moderate this effect. In addition, we investigate policy uncertainty spillovers among our sample countries to help us understand the systemic risk arising from the cross-border transmission of EPU. We find that approximately 50% of the economic policy uncertainty in the sample countries originates from other countries rather than their own. Developed countries are net exporters of uncertainty, while developing countries are net importers. Therefore, it is necessary for all countries, especially developing countries, to take appropriate measures to address the spillover effects of economic policy uncertainty in other countries and the resulting systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Duan, Yuejiao; Fan, Xiaoyun; Wang, Yu","Duan, Yuejiao (Nankai University - School of Finance); Fan, Xiaoyun (Nankai University - School of Finance); Wang, Yu (Nankai University - School of Finance)",,"Duan, Yuejiao (Nankai University); Fan, Xiaoyun (Nankai University); Wang, Yu (Nankai University)",Nankai University,grid.216938.7,Tianjin,,China,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147533874,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",Clinical Research; Prevention,Generic health relevance,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

We study the most common bank resolutions, such as a bailout, a bank sale and a ‘bad-bank’ mechanism. We first apply the financial fragility model of Goodhart et al. (2005, 2006a) to analyse the impact of these resolutions on bank behaviour in the systemic context. We then use a novel bank-level database consisting of banks from 39 countries that were subject to resolution mechanisms during the period of 1992-2017 and analyse the impact of the mechanisms on bank performance. Our findings suggest that there is no clear winner among the studied resolution mechanisms. We argue that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ resolution approach is suboptimal. While mergers can deliver good results at the beginning of the crisis, this is less likely at the later stage of the crisis. In the event of severe crises mechanisms that aim at restructuring bank balance sheet are most likely to deliver positive results. We do not find any support for bank bailouts. Lastly, through our calibration exercise we find that resolution mechanisms are most likely to be effective in mitigating systemic risk only during the event of moderate crisis and not during the time of severe crisis. Our paper calls for an urgent need to apply new bank resolution mechanisms as tools that could tangibly contribute to the reduction of the systemic nature of crisis.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Hryckiewicz, Aneta; Kryg, Natalia; Tsomocos, Dimitrios P.","Hryckiewicz, Aneta (Goethe University of Frankfurt; Kozminski University); Kryg, Natalia (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)); Tsomocos, Dimitrios P.

SES increases in the institution’s leverage and its marginal expected shortfall (MES), that is, its losses in the tail of the system’s loss distribution.

In the case of a banking panic, Russian SIBs are at risk because they have a significant number of deposits from individuals and because the deposit insurance system is not designed to prevent a systemic crisis. Methods: The authors identified numerical values of indicators for safe “corridor” boundaries reflecting the degree of dependence of SIBs on depositors using exponential smoothing technique. Findings: The indicators exceeding the upper limits of the “corridor” reveal a disproportion in the structure of banking resources sources, which can be called a “deposit bubble”. If such a “deposit bubble” bursts, it will lead to the loss of a significant part of bank liabilities, which means a potential risk of a suspension of banking activities. If the indicators go beyond the lower limits of the “corridor”, it shows the realized risk of an outflow of individual deposits and, accordingly, a reduction of bank liabilities.",The reported study was funded by Russian Foundation for Basic Research according to the research project No. 18-010-00657.,,"Advances in Science, Technology & Innovation",Business 4.0 as a Subject of the Digital Economy,Springer Nature,"2522-8714, 2522-8722",,2022-06-15,2022,2022-06-15,2022,,,629-636,Closed,Chapter,"Evlakhova, Yulia S.; Alifanova, Elena N.; Tregubova, Alexandra A.; Koshel’, Natalia V.","Evlakhova, Yulia S.

It provides in-depth insight into this phenomenon, conducted by the central banks in several economies – for example, the Eurozone, Switzerland and Japan – and its possible impact on systemic risk. Although it has been introduced as a temporary policy instrument, NIRP remained widely used for a longer period and by a greater range of central banks than initially expected. Thus, the book explores its effects and implications on the banking sector and financial markets, with a particular focus on potentially adverse consequences. There is a strong accent on the uniqueness of negative policy rates in the context of financial stability concerns. The authors assess whether NIRP has any – or in principle a stronger – impact on systemic risk than conventional monetary policy. The book is targeted at presenting and evaluating the initial experiences of NIRP policy during normal, i.e., pre-COVID, times. Consequently, the periods in which pre-established macroeconomic relations are rapidly disrupted or, specifically, when the source of the disruption is not purely economic in nature (unlike in systemic crisis) remain rather beyond the scope of the book. The authors adopt both theoretical and most notably practical approaches to explore the key issues and outline the policy implications for both monetary and macroprudential authorities, with respect to negative interest rate policy.

After the start of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and against the backdrop ofincreased Western sanctions pressure, crypto activity has rapidly increased, as it aims at withdrawing funds from the world’s leading crypto exchanges and platforms, as well as the outflow of capital from the Russian Federation. In turn, the active cryptocurrency legalization of undeclared income in Russia led to serious jumps in the rate of cryptocurrencies: from their initial growth to a sharp decline. Following the results of the above studies, the author proposes a mechanism for combating illegal circulation of cryptocurrency before the adoption of legislative regulation. The author substantiates the conclusion that the task of ensuring financial security and stability of the national currency, as well as combating the legalization of criminal proceeds and the outflow of capital from the country should be solved by introducing criminal law rules on liability for illegal circulation of cryptocurrency.",,,Actual Problems of Russian Law,,Kutafin Moscow State Law University,"1994-1471, 2782-1862",,2022-06-14,2022,2022-06-14,,17,8,144-149,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Dolgieva, M.

In this article, we consider the debate regarding the future of hedge fund regulation, building the case that regulatory reform to constrain excessive leverage must be applied in equal measure to all financial market participants, not just hedge funds.

It is common that the asset owners and enterprise network operators need to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk by remunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this paper, we use a principal–agent framework to capture the service relationships between the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal) and the cyber risk manager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management problem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber risk outcomes of the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that the manager expends on protecting the resources. Under this information pattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational behaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic contract design within the framework of a class of stochastic differential games. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent’s hidden efforts. We characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a stochastic optimal control program which can be solved using dynamic programming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario with complete information and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead to a new certainty equivalence principle for principal–agent problems. Finally, case studies over networked systems are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.","This research is partially supported by award 2015-ST-061-CIRC01, U. S.

We advance a robust methodological approach for the integrated analysis of those conditions in SES traps. Our advancement consists of a novel combination of the Networks of Action Situations (NAS) approach with an agency-based polycentric power typology and the concept of discursive power. We test the approach by building on previous research on the Doñana estuary-delta SES (Guadalquivir estuary), which is characterized by a rigidity trap in the context of ecosystem and water governance. Specifically, we focus on a recent hydraulic megaproject involving deep dredging in the Guadalquivir estuary, finally canceled due to its broad negative socioeconomic and environmental repercussions. According to our analysis, certain governance, institutional and informational mechanisms currently prevent further SES degradation in Doñana. However, key governance actors are caught in a lasting coordination failure prone to mutual defection strategies owing to power dynamics and discursive-institutional inertia. Although seemingly stable due to counteractive mechanisms among actors, this situation is at continuous risk of being unbalanced by powerful actors promoting large SES interventions such as deep dredging. Such interventions bear the systemic risk of strong suppression of SES functions, and a regime shift to a lock-in trap. This overall undesirable situation might be escaped through transformative policy designs that take into account meso-level mechanisms, such as discursive power and its role in non-decision-making, pragmatic inaction, and inefficient investment and infrastructure.",,,SocArXiv,,Center for Open Science,,,2021-09-22,2021,2021-09-22,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Méndez, Pablo F.; Clement, Floriane; Salvador, Guillermo Palau; Díaz-Delgado, Ricardo; Villamayor-Tomas, Sergio","Méndez, Pablo F.

Using a sample of the largest listed banks from 15 countries, we find that greater market power at the bank level and higher competition at the industry level lead to higher realized systemic risk.

As such, central banks have developed various tools to control and monitor inherent risks such as systemic risk, liquidity risks or operational risks that could affect one or more members of the system, and thus affect the payment chain of a given country. Our objective is to present a network topology methodology as a tool to study the characteristics and properties of the Interbank Payment System (SPI) in Ecuador. We establish systemically important players to determine whether their absence in simulated scenarios would cause financial contagion to the rest of the participants in the SPI. We have applied our network topology tool to detect systemic risk in the SPI during the period of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in 2020. We found that the SPI payment network is sensitive to the absence of its systemically important participants, as well as to exogenous events such as the pandemic, due to which a loss of network stability (payment execution delinquency) arises. This paper constitutes a first application of the network topology for the Ecuadorian case, and at the same time a tool for preventive or corrective policymaking on disruptions in the SPI payment system.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the document sent to the Latin American Journal of Central Banking.

This paper investigates the characteristics of financial cycles using a multivariate model-based filter. We extract cycles using an unobserved components time series model and applying state space methods. We estimate financial cycles for the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, using data from 1970 to 2014. For these countries, we find that the individual financial variables we examine have medium-term cycles which share a few common statistical properties. We therefore refer to these cycles as 'similar'. We find that overall financial cycles are longer than business cycles and have a higher amplitude. Moreover, such behavior varies over time and across countries. Our results suggest that estimates of the financial cycle can be a useful monitoring tool for policymakers as they may provide a broad indication about when risks to financial stability increase, remain stable, or decrease.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Galati, Gabriele; Hindrayanto, Irma; Koopman, Siem Jan; Vlekke, Marente","Galati, Gabriele (De Nederlandsche Bank); Hindrayanto, Irma (De Nederlandsche Bank); Koopman, Siem Jan (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - School of Business and Economics; Tinbergen Institute; Aarhus University - CREATES); Vlekke, Marente (CPB Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis)",,"Galati, Gabriele (De Nederlandsche Bank); Hindrayanto, Irma (De Nederlandsche Bank); Koopman, Siem Jan (); Vlekke, Marente ()",De Nederlandsche Bank,grid.459463.9,Amsterdam,,Netherlands,,,,,,17,3,,6.45,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102451428,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 44 Human Society",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,14 Life Below Water,dims

These concentrated commonalities have far reaching implications on systemic financial risk. Based on the commonality structure of banks' balance sheets, we construct a bipartite financial network and design novel indicators to analyze the systemic risk of China's banking system and its relation to the real economy. Results show that (1) considering the interconnectivity, indirect loss arising from common exposure is much higher than direct loss; (2) concentrated common exposure to mortgage is demonstrated to be the most significant source of systemic vulnerability in China; (3) the derived contagion network shows the property of “small world”, which plays an important role in generating systemic risk, amplified non-linearly by multi-rounds of contagion; (4) a bank's systemic importance/vulnerability depends on complex interaction between asset volume, leverage rate, and its commonality of asset composition to other banks. The model proposed in this study provides a new structural perspective to investigate the systemic risk, and a macroprudential instrument to complement existing stress testing that contributes to more efficient and precise regulations. Moreover, we contribute a ranking framework to assess each bank's systemic importance as well as vulnerability corresponding to specific real sectors.","Acknowledgement The authors are very grateful to Prof. Haizhong An, Prof. Shupei Huang, Prof. Xiangyun Gao at China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Prof. Yulei Luo, and Prof. Dragon Yongjun Tang at Hong Kong University for their inspirations during the forming process of this paper, and to seminar participants at Shenzhen University, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics for their comments.

The aim of this paper is to summarize the most important insights for competition policy that could be derived from the turbulent period 2008–2010. The financial crisis is seen as project that demanded sound management from competition policy and enforcement. The insights will be presented in the instructive form of ‘lessons learnt’ which represents a common approved project management technique. We come to the result that the financial crisis is not the result of ‘too much competition’, but of regulatory failure and that the main answers to the financial crisis have to come from ‘smart regulation’. The relaxation of competition policy would be the wrong policy response in troubled times since competition policy can play an important role in bringing the crisis economy back on track. In contrast to banking we see no economic rationale for rescue packages for other economic sectors by referring to systemic risk. The renaissance of industrial policy is viewed with great skepticism since empirical evidence shows that the effort of picking ‘winners’ all too often results in saving ‘losers’.","The author is grateful to Karl Aiginger, Gunther Tichy and Michael P.

240,pub.1102281584,10.2139/ssrn.1569586,,,,Participating Mortgages and the Efficiency of Financial Intermediation,"This paper offers a means to enhance the efficiency of the financial system in the form of Participating Mortgages (PMs) to make it more resilient and to mitigate systemic risk. We establish a basic setup to study the variants of PMs, distinguish them from convertible mortgages and derive closed-form solutions to price a range of PMs. We obtain new results for Shared Appreciation Mortgages, Shared Income Mortgages and Shared Equity Mortgages. We illustrate our findings with examples showing that PMs are attractive in an environment with prepayments. Finally, we conclude our study with the public policy implications of employing PMs as workout loans, especially in the current sub-prime crisis. Participating Mortgages have the capacity to manage risk at the micro-economic level with the potential for reducing default at the macro-economic level. They are more appealing than convertible mortgages as they are more versatile and retain features of debt through the tenure of the facility (without diluting control rights of its investors). We proceeded by investigating variants of participating mortgages (such as Shared Income, Shared Appreciation and Shared Equity Mortgages) and demonstrate, that the closed-form profit cap formula allows tractability. We thus contribute by evaluating closed-form finite maturity pricing conditions, which are scarce in real estate finance. We also focus on random tenure mortgages, which arise in the context of default and prepayment risk. Furthermore, we illustrate the general applicability of the variants of a PM in a range of projects ranging from infrastructure to technology start-up's. Finally, we illustrate the employment of PMs as work-out loans especially in the recent sub-prime crisis. A PM is basically a financial innovation that matches the income in addition to the appreciation in value of the property instead of just the borrowers permanent income.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ebrahim, Muhammed Shahid; Shackleton, Mark B.; Wojakowski, Rafal M.","Ebrahim, Muhammed Shahid (Durham Business School); Shackleton, Mark B.

It considers the regulatory tension between facilitating growth of the crowdlending industry and the need for regulatory intervention to ensure adequate investor protection. Regulatory lag is evident in uncertainties surrounding the application of existing EU regulatory instruments for credit institutions not written with crowdlending in mind. The regulatory vacuum at EU level enables regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom by platform operators. Accordingly the case is made for a proportionate European directive for crowdlending based on a prudential licensing and passporting framework covering matters such as minimum capitalisation, due diligence, disclosure rules, conflicts of interest, client money rules, protection for investors against bad debts and platform collapse, as well protection for the economy as a whole against potential systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ahern, Deirdre M.","Ahern, Deirdre M.

Systemic Risk is the Risk that has the overall effect on the Risk of another. Systemic Risks of Islamic stock issues are discussed in this study. This study analyzed whether there is any significant relationship between individual Risk (Value at Risk) in Islamic stocks with systemic Risk. Systemic Risk is calculated using the Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) with an estimated Quantile Regression Model (QRM).  Based on the data processing results, the stock with the highest Value at Risk is PT Astra Agro Lestari, Tbk (AALI), whereas the stocks with the highest systemic risk value are PT.

The precise mathematical formulation of SR is still scrutinised, but the main purpose is to evaluate the financial distress of a system as a result of the failure of one component of the financial system in question. Many of the mathematical definitions of SR are based on evaluating expectations in extreme regions and therefore, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) represents the key ingredient in producing valuable estimates of SR and even its decomposition per individual components of the entire system. Without doubt, the prescribed dependence model amongst the system components has a major impact over our asymptotic approximations. Thus, this paper considers various well-known dependence models in the EVT literature that allow us to generate SR estimates. Our findings reveal that SR has a significant impact under asymptotic dependence, while weak tail dependence, known as asymptotic independence, produces an insignificant loss over the regulatory capital.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2017,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Asimit, Alexandru Vali; Li, Jinzhu","Asimit, Alexandru Vali (Cass Business School, City, University of London); Li, Jinzhu (Nankai University - School of Mathematical Sciences)",,"Asimit, Alexandru Vali (); Li, Jinzhu (Nankai University)",Nankai University,grid.216938.7,Tianjin,,China,,,,,,1,0,,0.45,,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/17080/1/Systemic_Risk_Asymptotics_Asimit_Li_2017_final%20%282%29.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090424661,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 49 Mathematical Sciences",,,,,,B10 Mathematical Sciences,,dims

In this way we can study the interaction of two important channels for systemic risk (correlation of asset returns and contagion due direct financial linkages). We carry out a simulation study that determines the probability of a systemic crisis in the banking network as a function of both the asset correlation, and the connectivity and structure of the financial network. An important observation is the fact that the relation between asset correlation and the probability of a systemic crisis is hump-shaped; in particular, lowering the correlation between the asset returns of different banks does not always imply a lower probability of a systemic crisis. Moreover, in contrast to other studies we find that diversification at the level of individual banks may be beneficial for financial stability even if it does lead to a higher asset return correlation.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Frey, Rüdiger; Hledik, Juraj","Frey, Rüdiger (); Hledik, Juraj (Vienna Graduate School of Finance, Students)",,"Frey, Rüdiger (); Hledik, Juraj ()",,,,,,,,,,,5,0,,1.82,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102421655,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

It failed to capture the contribution of systemic risk, which is considered to be the risk that is the outcome of collective behaviour of financial institutions that have significant effects on the real economy. This paper investigates whether the increased presence of foreign banks which are listed on a national stock market has contributed to the increase in the systemic risk, in particular, after the financial crisis of 2007–2009. We examine the extent to which the distress of foreign banks contributes to systemic risk for the US. In addition using relevant data for the UK we investigate the extent to which distress within different sub-segments of the financial system, namely, the banking, insurance and other financial services industries contribute to systemic risk. We conduct our analysis with the CoVaR measure of systemic risk recently developed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) using daily data for the period 2 January 2000 to 31 December 2012. Furthermore, we complement our analysis with the application of two tests, the significance and dominance tests, to provide a formal comparison of the relative contribution of either the domestic or foreign banks and/or each individual financial sector. Our main results provide evidence that in the US, the non-US banks contribute to the systemic risk although most of the contribution comes from the US banks. In the case of the UK we show that the banking industry contributes relatively more to systemic risk in periods of distress than the insurance industry or the other financial services industry. Furthermore, when we examine the estimated ΔCoVaR measures, we observe that for all sectors the contribution to systemic risk has increased since 2008.",,,International Review of Economics & Finance,,Elsevier,"1059-0560, 1873-8036",,2015-11,2015,,2015-11,40,,127-140,Closed,Article,"Drakos, Anastassios A.; Kouretas, Georgios P.","Drakos, Anastassios A.

These discussions took place in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis that is the consequence of the bust of an house price bubble that took place in the US and spread out to most developed countries. Crucial to the success of such policy is the ability of the macro-prudential authority to identify in due time such imbalances, generally featured by asset price boom-bust cycles. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting house price booms according to alternative identification strategies and assess their robustness. In addition, we try to disentangle costless or low-cost from costly house price booms. Resorting both to a non-parametric approach and a discrete-choice (logit) model, we analyze the ability

Seaweed is considered a promising feedstock for food and feed that could be produced at offshore wind farms. Concerns about risks resulting in liability claims and insurance premiums are often seen as show-stoppers to multi-use at offshore wind farms. In this study, key environmental risks of seaweed cultivation at offshore wind farms, identified through literature review, are characterized based on stakeholder consultation. The current approach to risk governance is evaluated to assess how it can handle the uncertain, complex, and/or ambiguous risks of multi-use. It is concluded that current risk governance for multi-use is poorly equipped to deal with the systemic nature of risks. Risk governance should be a joint effort of governments and private regulators. It can improve if it is based on an adaptive framework for risk assessment that can deal with complex, systemic risks. Furthermore, it should be flexible and inclusive, i.e., open to new incoming information and stakeholder input, and taking into account and communicate about the different stakes and values of the various parties involved.

In this regulatory space jurisdictional borders are elusive. Especially the United States and the European Union are applying what seems to be a novel type of regulatory strategy designed to protect their market share and curb regulatory arbitrage. The strategy, dubbed here the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, builds on unilateralist application of extraterritoriality, forms of direct and indirect protectionism, and conditional deference. Deference strategies such as the US substituted compliance and the EU equivalence regime should be regarded as carrots, applied together with the sticks of extraterritoriality and protectionism to drive regulatory convergence towards the strongest. However, the EU and US have failed to fill the leadership void in the global financial governance system, which remains soft at its core, and instead locked themselves in a regulatory turf war which has prevented them from recognising each other's regulatory frameworks or finalising their own. Meanwhile, looming risks of costly regulatory retaliation are increasing market fragmentation and deglobalisation. The emerging ""titanic model"" of systemic risk management, where risk is concentrated in presumably watertight national compartments rather than mutualised globally, is not the way towards a more stable global financial system. In the short term, a successful completion of the transatlantic partnership is needed in order to reach the derivative reform's ultimate goals and to counter financial fragmentation. But acknowledging the many practical and political problems involved in the exportation of rules through the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, which can also be manifested in a bilateral form, this paper joins the increasing number of scholars calling for more global and multilateral forms of financial governance.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Marjosola, Heikki","Marjosola, Heikki (University of Helsinki - Faculty of Law)",,"Marjosola, Heikki (University of Helsinki)",University of Helsinki,grid.7737.4,Helsinki,,Finland,,,,,,1,1,,0.41,,https://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/1814/39022/1/LAW_2016_01.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102453922,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies",,,,,,C18 Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims

These bank responses generate externalities that propagate in the form of macro-financial feedback loops. This paper develops a credit response and externalities analysis model (CREAM) that integrates a disaggregated banking sector into an otherwise standard macroeconomic structural vector autoregressive model. It shows that accounting for macro-financial feedback loops can significantly affect macroeconomic outcomes and bank-specific stress tests results. The heterogeneity in bank lending responses matters: it determines how each bank fares under adverse conditions and the external effects that banks impose on each other and on economic activity.

We found that the tail risk of technology firms is higher than the financial firms, whereas they are less likely to be in distress conditional upon a shock from the system. However, this finding for technology firms reverses when we use recent data via our six-year rolling estimates. We conclude that, similar to finance firms, there should be tighter regulations for technology firms since technology firms are riskier than the finance firms.

Using generalised DebtRank dynamics, we measure observed systemic risk on e-MID network data (augmented by BankFocus information) and compare it with the expected systemic of a null model network -- obtained through an appropriate maximum-entropy approach constraining relevant balance sheet variables. We show that the aggregate levels of observed and expected systemic risks are usually compatible but differ significantly during turbulent times -- in our case, after the default of Lehman Brothers (2009) and the VLTRO implementation by the ECB (2012). At the individual level instead, banks are typically more or less risky than what their balance sheet prescribes due to their position in the network. Our results confirm on one hand that balance sheet information used within a proper maximum-entropy network model provides good systemic risk estimates, and on the other hand the importance of knowing the empirical details of the network for conducting precise stress tests of individual banks -- especially after systemic events.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ferracci, Alessandro; Cimini, Giulio","Ferracci, Alessandro (Department of Economics and Law, Sapienza University of Rome); Cimini, Giulio (Northwestern University - Northwestern Institute for Complex Systems (NICO))",,"Ferracci, Alessandro (Sapienza University of Rome); Cimini, Giulio ()",Sapienza University of Rome,grid.7841.a,Rome,Lazio,Italy,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14360,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141596408,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Sybil and double-spending attacks, as well as a mechanism for currency
issuance. Hashcash PoW has successfully secured the Bitcoin network since its
inception, however, as the network has expanded to take on additional value
storage and transaction volume, Bitcoin PoW's heavy reliance on electricity has
created scalability issues, environmental concerns, and systemic risks. Mining
efforts have concentrated in areas with low electricity costs, creating single
points of failure. Although PoW security properties rely on imposing a
trivially verifiable economic cost on miners, there is no fundamental reason
for it to consist primarily of electricity cost. The authors propose a novel
PoW algorithm, Optical Proof of Work (oPoW), to eliminate energy as the primary
cost of mining. Proposed algorithm imposes economic difficulty on the miners,
however, the cost is concentrated in hardware (capital expense-CAPEX) rather
than electricity (operating expenses-OPEX). The oPoW scheme involves minimal
modifications to Hashcash-like PoW schemes, inheriting safety/security
properties from such schemes.
  Rapid growth and improvement in silicon photonics over the last two decades
has led to the commercialization of silicon photonic co-processors (integrated
circuits that use photons instead of electrons to perform specialized computing
tasks) for low-energy deep learning. oPoW is optimized for this technology such
that miners are incentivized to use specialized, energy-efficient photonics for
computation. Beyond providing energy savings, oPoW has the potential to improve
network scalability, enable decentralized mining outside of low electricity
cost areas, and democratize issuance. Due to the CAPEX dominance of mining
costs, oPoW hashrate will be significantly less sensitive to underlying coin
price declines.",,,arXiv,,,,,2019-11-12,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dubrovsky, Michael; Ball, Marshall; Penkovsky, Bogdan","Dubrovsky, Michael (); Ball, Marshall (); Penkovsky, Bogdan ()",,"Dubrovsky, Michael (); Ball, Marshall (); Penkovsky, Bogdan ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,66.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122562583,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,7 Affordable and Clean Energy,dims

results are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an
aggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the
two-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling
strength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength,
systemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in
the two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size
that are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied
to a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into
a less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases,

in the form of systemic risk. They create a network of interbank exposures by
which they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper,
we show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to
devise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that
captures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different
impact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax
a Systemic Risk Tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the
matching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique
equilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient,
i.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume. On the
other hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings exist,
which are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively
stimulate a `rewiring' of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it
more resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume.
Moreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like
tax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it
taxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to
have a limited effect on reducing systemic risk while it decreases transaction
volume.",,,arXiv,,,,,2016-06-11,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Leduc, Matt V.; Thurner, Stefan","Leduc, Matt V. (); Thurner, Stefan ()",,"Leduc, Matt V.

202,pub.1102370358,10.2139/ssrn.2210965,,,,Financial Markets Uncertainty and the Rawlsian Argument for Central Counterparty Clearing of OTC Derivatives,"One of the key measures in the Dodd-Frank Act intended to curb systemic risk in the financial system is the central counterparty (CCP) clearing mandate for over-the-counter derivatives. The mandate reflects the belief of legislators and many financial markets experts that these derivatives, particularly credit default swaps, were a key cause of the financial crisis of 2008. While derivative markets do create extensive interconnections between financial institutions, and were essential to the creation of the structured finance securities that fueled the housing bubble, in hindsight it appears that derivatives were not a proximate cause but more likely one of many ‘but for’ structural causes of the crisis. As a result, the CCP clearing mandate has come in for extensive criticism on the grounds that it carries with it significant risks for the global financial system, while providing little benefit in return. This Article offers a critical examination of the arguments against CCP clearing and a defense of the mandate and other Dodd-Frank Title VII derivatives provisions. Beginning with the fundamental uncertainty about the true causes of the crisis that remains, including a strong probable role for a ‘behavioral’ cause of the crisis on account of the panic of financial institutions, it then examines the arguments against CCP clearing, finding that they rely on overly narrow boundaries in order to achieve a measure of precision in making a cost-benefit analysis, thereby ignoring many of the important costs that derivatives indirectly contributed to. Given that a more complete cost-benefit analysis appears to run aground on the complexity of accurately enumerating all the costs and benefits associated with modern financial markets, this Article instead proposes looking at the problem of derivatives regulation through a Rawlsian framework. Central to Rawls’s thought is the procedure of decision-making under conditions of fundamental uncertainty, or the maximin rule. I argue that application of the maximin rule is appropriate here, and that unlike the standard cost-benefit analysis grounded in utilitarianism, Rawls’s views lead to a holistic understanding of the financial markets in their larger societal context that both guides and justifies legislative action in the context of fundamental uncertainty by prioritizing the safety of the financial system. Such a holistic understanding of economic regulation is necessary as governments struggle to preserve social stability in the face of widespread economic challenges such as unemployment, income inequality, excessive debt, and continuing instability in the financial system.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2013,2013,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"McNamara, Steven R.","McNamara, Steven R.

226,pub.1102331642,10.2139/ssrn.1670831,,,,The Making of Good Supervision: Learning to Say 'No',"The quality of financial sector supervision has emerged as a key issue from the financial crisis. While most countries operated broadly under the same regulatory standards, differences emerged in supervisory approaches. The international response to this crisis has focused on the need for more and better regulations (e.g., in areas such as bank capital, liquidity and provisioning) and on developing a framework to address systemic risks, but there has been less discussion of how supervision itself could be strengthened. The IMF’s work in assessing compliance with financial sector standards over the past decade in member countries suggests that while progress is being made in putting regulation in place, work remains to be done in many countries to strengthen supervision. How can this enhanced supervision be achieved? Based on an examination of lessons from the crisis and the findings of these assessments of countries’ compliance with financial standards, the paper identifies the following key elements of good supervision - that it is intrusive, skeptical, proactive, comprehensive, adaptive, and conclusive. To achieve these elements, the 'ability' to supervise, which requires appropriate resources, authority, organization and constructive working relationships with other agencies must be complemented by the 'will' to act. Supervisors must be willing and empowered to take timely and effective action, to intrude on decision-making, to question common wisdom, and to take unpopular decisions. Developing this 'will' to act' is a more difficult task and requires that supervisors have a clear and unambiguous mandate, operational independence coupled with accountability, skilled staff, and a relationship with industry that avoids 'regulatory capture.' These essential elements of good supervision need to be given as much attention as the regulatory reforms that are being contemplated at both national and international levels. Indeed, only if supervision is strengthened can we hope to effectively deliver on the challenging - but crucial - regulatory reform agenda. For this to happen, society must stand with supervisors as they play their role as naysayers in times of exuberance.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Fiechter, Jonathan; Narain, Aditya; Elliot, Jennifer; Tower, Ian; Bologna, Pierluigi; Hsu, Michael","Fiechter, Jonathan (International Monetary Fund (IMF)); Narain, Aditya (International Monetary Fund (IMF)); Elliot, Jennifer (affiliation not provided to SSRN); Tower, Ian (International Monetary Fund (IMF)); Bologna, Pierluigi (Bank of Italy); Hsu, Michael (International Monetary Fund (IMF))",,"Fiechter, Jonathan (); Narain, Aditya (); Elliot, Jennifer (); Tower, Ian (); Bologna, Pierluigi (Bank of Italy); Hsu, Michael ()",Bank of Italy,grid.466503.2,Rome,,Italy,,,,,,10,1,,2.45,,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/_spn1008.ashx,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102331642,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",Behavioral and Social Science,Generic health relevance; Mental health,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Although they are distinct from one another, the atherosclerotic and thrombotic processes appear to be interdependent and may be integrated under the term ""atherothrombosis."" It is now clear that plaque composition, rather than the percent stenosis, is a major determinant of plaque vulnerability. Plaque disruption seems to depend on both passive and active phenomena and is not purely mechanical. Inflammation (activation of monocytes/macrophages) is a major determinant of both plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity as they relate to plaque disruption. In one-third of acute coronary syndromes, there is, however, no plaque disruption but only superficial erosion of a markedly stenotic, fibrotic plaque. In these cases, thrombus formation may be exacerbated by a hyperthrombogenic state present in patients with certain systemic risk factors. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis and hemostasis. This dynamic organ regulates blood thrombogenicity as well as contractile, secretory, and mitogenic activities in the vessel wall. Some classic risk factors induce endothelial dysfunction by reducing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, increasing tissue endothelin-1, and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Vascular hemostasis, which is the maintenance of blood fluidity and vascular integrity, is achieved by counter-balancing the intrinsic clotting tendency of blood. As a consequence of the central role of endothelial cells in hemostatic control, a dysfunctional endothelium will generate a pro-thrombotic environment favoring development of atherosclerotic lesions and thrombotic complications.",The authors are grateful to Bob Guerra for his editorial assistance.,,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,,Elsevier,"0735-1097, 1558-3597","Acute Disease; C-Reactive Protein; Coronary Thrombosis; Disease Progression; Endothelium, Vascular; Humans; Myocardial Ischemia; Risk Factors",2003-02,2003,,2003-02,41,4,s7-s14,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Corti, Roberto; Fuster, Valentin; Badimon, Juan Jose","Corti, Roberto (Zena and Michael A.

This chapter investigates the future of finance by exploring three questions: how will AI transform finance, what can AI do and how can we get it to work, and what do we need to do to regulate AI in finance. Today, AI and deep learning have broad ranging business applications in deposits and lending, insurance, payments to investment management and capital markets.

109,pub.1103581241,10.2139/ssrn.3164258,,,,Regulatory Technology,"Technology changes society. Financial services and their regulation is not immune from this. Indeed, distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence have the potential to change the way in which financial services are delivered and regulated. This paper discusses the use of technology for the purpose of financial regulation. The hope is that this will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of financial regulation. At present regulatory technology is in the very early stages of development. The authors therefore start by reviewing the technology that is inspiring those who are attempting to create regulatory technology. They analyse distributed ledger technology, which was originally developed for cryptocurrencies, but can also be used to maintain and share records of other assets or of anti-money-laundering information. They also discuss the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for the purpose of financial regulation. After that the current work of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on model driven and machine executable regulation will be examined. This work has so far not been analysed in the literature. Distributed ledger technology has shown ways of sharing information that could be used to enable the regulator to access records held by regulated entities. This could remove manual processes from current reporting requirements. It would enable the regulator to access data held by regulated entities in real time. Going further into the future the regulator could stop reviewing individual data points and use artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyse the data held by regulated entities. Software could be developed that identifies patterns and flags anomalies helping the regulator and regulated entities to identify risk as it emerges. This would create a new way of evaluating the risk profile of regulated entities. At present the regulator issues rules in natural language. Regulated entities develop their own individual solutions of compliance. They take the risk of falling short of the expectations of the regulator. In the future compliance could be as easy as for the regulated entity as uploading regulatory software which collects and reports data automatically and perhaps even autonomously. The paper highlights that there will be a learning period during which the limitations of the technology will reveal themselves. An important contribution of the article is that the translation of natural language into computer code changes meaning. Programming involves policy choices. This point has so far not been articulated in the literature or in the communications issued by the UK Financial Conduct Authority or the Bank of England. The article contributes further to the existing debate by arguing that the regulator's response needs to be informed by five criteria that have been developed to evaluate the quality of regulation: democratic legitimacy; accountability of the regulator; fair, accessible and open procedure; expertise and efficiency. These criteria need to be built into regulatory technology. Programming is more than an exercise in computer science. The regulator needs to determine an appropriate level of involving itself in the creation and maintenance of regulatory software. It needs to invest resources enabling its staff to understand the technology, anticipate problems and develop an appropriate response. The paper then connects the five quality criteria with five regulatory strategies: command regulation, meta-regulation, co-regulation, enforced self-regulation and self-regulation. It shows how each of these could be used for regulatory technology and analyses the respective advantages and disadvantages against the background of possible use cases for regulatory technology. The article points out that the precision inherent in computer language comes at the price of a reduction in flexibility which, if only for the time being, will limit potential use cases. Moreover any application needs to be designed in a way that allows human actors to take into account factors that do not easily reveal themselves in data. Regulatory technology needs to be designed in a way that allows both the regulator and regulated entities to retain a view of the overall picture. There is also a risk that high levels of standardisation influence the business model of regulated entities making them more similar and leading to higher levels of systemic risk. Another trap to be avoided is regulatory capture which makes it all the more important that the regulator invests in its own expertise. Following the financial crisis self-regulatory strategies have been unpopular. The command approach that has followed the crisis has been criticised for being too limiting and expensive. It is tempting to use the availability of new technology as an occasion to go modify the overall approach to regulation. The article makes the point that the availability of new technology does not affect the incentives of regulated entities. Technology is neutral. It serves those who develop it. There is no technological reason allowing us to have more faith in the ability of regulated entities to align business interests with regulatory standards. Moreover the use of technology will introduce a new type of service provider to this area of the law. Technology firms have their own business model which affects the type of services they are able to provide. In addition the market for the analysis of data is already very concentrated. This limits the bargaining power of all but the largest regulated entities and also affects the ability of the regulator to represent the public interest. The regulator is currently at the stage of testing possible technological solutions in consultation with regulated entities. It will need to invest further enabling it to adequately oversee the application and maintenance of regulatory technology as it emerges.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Micheler, Eva; Whaley, Anna","Micheler, Eva (London School of Economics - Law Department); Whaley, Anna (Independent)",,"Micheler, Eva (London School of Economics and Political Science); Whaley, Anna ()",London School of Economics and Political Science,grid.13063.37,London,,United Kingdom,,,,,,5,2,,11.51,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103581241,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law,,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,,dims

Public responses to the recent Financial Crisis were immediate and drastic to resuscitate the global economy while attempting to make the markets safer. Many financial services sectors have since recovered to pre-crisis levels. One such industry is project finance, which comprises various financing arrangements often used to fund long-term infrastructure or industrial projects. Curiously, significant post-crisis banking regulations and other global credit enhancement initiatives are pushing banks out of project finance and giving rise to institutional investors. This Comment argues that animated institutional activity in project finance may increase both financial and, more notably, governance risks. Further, increased institutional investment in project finance shifts the risk intended to be captured under new banking regulations to unregulated markets and makes the financial system more complex and interconnected. Ultimately, public responses to the Financial Crisis may have the unintended consequence of increasing project-level risks and injecting seemingly regulated systemic risk back into the global financial system.",,,Michigan Law Review,,University of Michigan Law Library,"0026-2234, 1939-8557, 00262234, 19398557",,2018,2018,2018,2018,,117.2,383,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Park, David","Park, David (University of Michigan Law School)",,"Park, David (University of Michigan–Ann Arbor)",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,grid.214458.e,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,,,,,,3,2,,,,https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1928&context=mlr,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145584852,48 Law and Legal Studies,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The primary goal was to recognize the chromatographic conditions wherein propitious segregation of the integrants with quality peaks can be attained. An attempt to expound the target analytical profile was made to accomplish this goal, and critical method attributes (CMAs), viz. percentage acetonitrile content, injection volume and pH, which affect critical quality attributes (CQAs), were identified using systemic risk analysis. Box-Behnken design was employed to develop a relationship between CMAs and CQAs, which engenders an analytical design space. Efficient chromatographic separation for pregabalin and piperine was attained using an analytical C18 column and mobile phase comprising acetonitrile-water (pH 6.9; 70:30%, v/v) in an isocratic elution mode with a 1 ml/min flow rate. The elution was descried at an isosbestic wavelength of 221 nm using a photodiode array detector. The International Conference on Harmonization guidelines were adopted for the developed HPLC method. The validated HPLC method can be further utilized for the simultaneous quantification and detection of pregabalin and piperine in other lipid-based nanopharmaceuticals such as polymeric nanoparticles, nanocrystals, solid-lipid nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, etc., in in vitro and in vivo studies.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the Department of Pharmacognosy and Department of Pharmaceutics, Jamia Hamdard University, New Delhi, India for providing necessary facilities.

Moving along this line, the book under review shows that the protection of financial nationalism contributes to the creation of global systemic risks. In this review essay, I discuss the three overarching themes addressed in the book – namely, the logic of financial nationalism, the role of soft and hard law in the international governance of finance and the related problem of compliance. International financial law is still emerging as a discipline and the issues under discussion are at the heart of the ongoing debate about how to devise adequate international structures and international norms to govern markets and control systemic risks in finance. Proceeding from a critical approach to the international law of finance, I analyse the book’s focus on financial nationalism and the limits of its juxtaposition with the economic logic of externalities; the case for strengthened formalization; and, finally, the extent to which the theoretical framework proposed in the book is relevant for rethinking the logic and prospect of compliance in international finance.",,,European Journal of International Law,,Oxford University Press (OUP),"0938-5428, 1464-3596",,2020-11-04,2020,2020-11-04,2020-12-15,31,3,1133-1155,Closed,Article,"Borlini, Leonardo","Borlini, Leonardo (International Law, Department of Legal Studies/BAFFI CAREFIN (Centre for Applied Research on International Markets, Banking, Finance and Regulation), University Bocconi)",,"Borlini, Leonardo (Bocconi University)",Bocconi University,grid.7945.f,Milan,,Italy,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,6.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130996407,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4803 International and Comparative Law,,,,,,C18 Law,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims

Several studies have shown association between severity of retinal hard exudates and various components of serum lipid. The aim of this study is to estimate the proportion of severity of retinal hard exudates with risk factors like dyslipidemia, duration of diabetes, hypertension, HbA1c levels and microalbuminuria.   Methods: A hospital based cross sectional study was done involving 242 diabetic retinopathy patients. After dilated fundus examination, severity of retinal hard exudates was graded by photographs with Topcon fundus camera using modified airlie house classification. These grades were divided into three groups. Group 1 (absent or minimal hard exudates) included patients with grade 0, 1 or 2 hard exudates; group 2 (hard exudates present), included patients with grade 3 or 4 hard exudates and group 3 (prominent hard exudates), patients with grade 5 hard exudates. Values of serum lipid profile, HbA1C and urine microalbumin were analysed in association with severity of retinal hard exudates. Results: Out of the 242 diabetic retinopathy patients, the male female ratio was 1:1 and the mean age was 59.8±7.4 years. There were 12% patients in group one, 52.5% in group two and 35.5% in group three. On univariate analysis, severity of hard exudates was significantly associated with serum cholesterol (p value<0.01), LDL (p value<0.01) triglycerides (p value<0.01), HbA1c (p value<0.01), systemic hypertension (p value<0.01) and urine microalbumin (p value=0.01).   Conclusions: Severity of retinal hard exudates in diabetic retinopathy patients is significantly associated with risk factors like systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, raised HbA1C levels and urine microalbumin.",,,International Journal of Advances in Medicine,,Medip Academy,"2349-3925, 2349-3933",,2020-12-22,2020,2020-12-22,,8,1,51-56,All OA; Gold,Article,"Silpa, Devi; Sathar, Anuja; Thankappan, Beena","Silpa, Devi (Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India); Sathar, Anuja (Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India); Thankappan, Beena (Department of Ophthalmology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India)",,"Silpa, Devi (Government Medical College); Sathar, Anuja (Government Medical College); Thankappan, Beena (Government Medical College)",Government Medical College,grid.413226.0,Thiruvananthapuram,Kerala,India,,,,,,1,1,,0.48,,https://www.ijmedicine.com/index.php/ijam/article/download/2681/1862,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134038935,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Prevention,Eye; Metabolic and endocrine,,,,"A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

new regulation. Banking regulation has not kept pace with all the complexities
of financial innovation. The academic literature on systemic risk is rapidly
expanding. The majority of papers analyse a single source or a consolidated
source of risk and its effect. A fraction of publications quantify systemic
risk measures or formulate penalties for systemically important financial
institutions that are of practical regulatory relevance. The challenges facing
systemic risk evaluation and regulation still persist, as the definition of
systemic risk is somewhat unsettled and that affects attempts to provide
solutions. Our understanding of systemic risk is evolving and the awareness of
data relevance is rising gradually; this challenge is reflected in the focus of
major international research initiatives. There is a consensus that the direct
and indirect costs of a systemic crisis are enormous as opposed to preventing
it, and that without regulation the externalities will not be prevented; but
there is no consensus yet on the extent and detail of regulation, and research
expectations are to facilitate the regulatory process. This report outlines an
integrated approach for systemic risk evaluation based on multiple types of
interbank exposures through innovative modelling approaches as tensorial
multilayer networks, suggests how to relate underlying economic data and how to
extend the network to cover financial market information. We reason about data
requirements and time scale effects, and outline a multi-model hypernetwork of
systemic risk knowledge as a scenario analysis and policy support tool. The
argument is that logical steps forward would incorporate the range of risk

Consistent with the idea that financial connectedness is a conduit for risk transmission, risk spillovers to the U.S. from foreign financial crises are magnified when the countries in crisis are well financially connected.

The Financial Times Stock Exchange survey notes that frontier markets exist in more than 150 countries. The sum of systemic risk in the frontier markets can hinder economic stability in terms of a herd of risk. Frontier markets are likely to imply unpredicted systemic risk if we think based on previous lessons learned from being unable to foresee the early signals of the Lehman Brothers shock. The reasons for the rarely studied systemic risk in these markets might be that the markets are systemically unimportant, and there is a lack of publicly available data access. Therefore, I gave it my best shot to capture systemic risk in the frontier market entirely using financial statement data. It is sometimes said that the frontier market is systemically not important because of its small size; however, the research argued that the interconnection between financial institutions is highly likely to raise systemic risk even if it is small. The fact is the majority of financial institutions in developed, emerging, and frontier markets are deeply interconnected with each other via a network. For instance, the financial market in Mongolia is representative of frontier markets. As a financial regulatory aspect, financial conglomerates are increasing and deepening their interconnection in bank-dominated and underdeveloped capital markets. Hence, the intuition is to capture the systemic uncertainty behind increasing conspiracies in financial conglomerates to negatively impact financial stability. To accomplish this, the methodology measures financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk can be computed by the systemic expected shortfall. The systemic expected shortfall would be dependent on the marginal expected shortfall and can be explained by financial leverage and liabilities as the predicting power increases. Moreover, financial statements are situational mirrors of financial institutions. Based on these assumptions, we empirically measured the time and cross-dimensions of systemic risk using financial statement data. Potential variables from financial statements were tested to identify variables that could forecast systemic risk. Stock returns and capital market data have been frequently experimented with in previous literature, and financial statement data of frontier markets are new for systemic risk measurement. As a result of the analysis, the systemic expected shortfall could explain cross-dimension systemic risk, which is financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk. Subsequently, the time series of the marginal expected shortfall can forecast the amount of systemic risk in the next two periods. Eventually, macroprudential policy, a policy tool for systemic risk, can be easily developed after forecasting financial institutions’ contribution to systemic risk.",,,New Frontiers in Regional Science: Asian Perspectives,Challenges in Fiscal and Monetary Policies in Mongolia,Springer Nature,"2199-5974, 2199-5982",,2023-02-12,2023,2023-02-12,2023,66,,147-180,Closed,Chapter,"Natsagdorj, Narantuya","Natsagdorj, Narantuya (Financial Regulatory Commission of Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia)","Natsagdorj, Narantuya ","Natsagdorj, Narantuya ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155329883,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

To do so, we exploit cross-sections of hedge funds monthly returns grouped by investment styles, and build a time-varying measure of tail dependence across styles. Relying on extreme value theory and regression techniques, we study the dynamics of the tail dependencies between fund styles conditional on factors reflecting the economic uncertainty and the stock market performance. The resulting tail dependence measures are used to construct a time-varying network between extreme losses of the various investment styles. We show that during a crisis period, while the extremal dependence between some pairs of investment styles remains stable, other pairs show a striking increase of their extremal connectedness.

The analysis shows that the credit cycle in the United States was indeed characterised by systemically relevant sector-specific boom/bust cycles during our sample period. Sectoral credit exuberance, with the exception of consumer credit, generally does not lead to broader credit exuberance within a period of one year. Taken together, these findings indicate that it may be useful to act upon sectoral credit cycles rather than on broad-based credit developments. Regarding the systemic relevance of sector-specific boom/bust cycles, the results indicate that CRE is the most systemic credit segment: exuberance in the sector-specific component of the CRE credit-to-GDP gap tends to be followed by a surge in financial stress and borrower delinquencies. Exuberance in the residential mortgage sector may also lead to financial stress and tends to be followed by a moderate rise in borrower delinquency rates. For sufficiently large shocks to C&I credit, there has been an increase in the aggregate credit risk at commercial banks in the United States, albeit not as strong as following sector-specific shocks to RRE and CRE mortgages. Finally, losses following a period of exuberance in sectoral credit developments are not necessarily limited to the exuberant credit segments. In particular, exuberance in CRE and RRE mortgage credit tends to raise delinquency rates in credit segments beyond real estate.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ferrari, Stijn; Kaltwasser, Pablo Rovira","Ferrari, Stijn (National Bank of Belgium); Kaltwasser, Pablo Rovira (National Bank of Belgium; Catholic University of Leuven (KUL))",,"Ferrari, Stijn (National Bank of Belgium); Kaltwasser, Pablo Rovira (National Bank of Belgium; KU Leuven)",KU Leuven; National Bank of Belgium,grid.5596.f; grid.484482.6,Leuven; Brussels,; ,Belgium; Belgium,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112532530,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This paper suggests a more nuanced view of the effect of interconnectivity and resource sharing since interconnectivity may contribute to system fragility, which is associated with a possibility of abrupt/discontinuous system transition to a persistent overloaded regime with unacceptably high delays. This possibility is a result of the same system interconnectivity, which enables not only desirable but also undesirable load transfer throughout the networked system. Our results indicate that benefits of dynamic queuing disciplines, including low latency, can be realized provided that the relevant systemic risks of undesirable contagion are eliminated or mitigated.

275,pub.1037055556,10.1080/13600826.2011.629992,,,,Global Governance and the Politics of Crisis,"The notion of global governance has always been intimately linked to that of crisis. In recent crisis episodes the architecture of global governance has been held responsible for weak or ineffective regulatory mechanisms that failed to either prevent systemic crises or to at least give an “early warning” of impending disasters, while in other episodes global governance institutions have been blamed for poor crisis responses and management. Global governance institutions have also been blamed for failing to expand the scope of their jurisdictions to incorporate new systemic risks and new market players, as well as for their inability to adapt to new political, economic, social and environmental challenges. The framing article for this special issue on “Global Governance in Crisis” examines four key features of global governance in the context of the global financial crisis: (1) the dynamic role played by ideas in making global governance “hang together” during periods of crisis; (2) how crisis serves as a driver of change in global governance (and why it sometimes does not); (3) how ubiquitous the global financial crisis was as an event in world politics; and (4) the conditions that constitute an event as a crisis. Due to the complexity and institutional “stickiness” of the contemporary architecture of global governance, the article concludes that a far-reaching overhaul and structural reforms in global governance processes is both costly and improbable in the short-term.",,,Global Society,,Taylor & Francis,"1360-0826, 1469-798X",,2012-01,2012,,2012-01,26,1,3-17,Closed,Article,"Broome, André; Clegg, Liam; Rethel, Lena","Broome, André (); Clegg, Liam (); Rethel, Lena ()","Rethel, Lena ","Broome, André (); Clegg, Liam (); Rethel, Lena ()",,,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,cOAlition S; ICRP - International Cancer Research Partnership; UKRI - UK Research and Innovation,United Kingdom,grant.2783220,ES/I018603/1,20,4,,7.39,1.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037055556,44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration; 4408 Political Science,,Generic health relevance,,,,C19 Politics and International Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",dims

In its report, the “de Larosière report” (2009), this group identified a range of weaknesses in the EU regulatory and supervisory structure that were laid bare by the crisis. A key finding was that financial supervisors were generally charged with the single objective of safeguarding the specific elements of the financial system within their remit. In short, their focus was on specific institutions or markets that were within their scope of responsibility. This microprudential supervisory approach did not focus on the health or stability of the system as a whole. There was to some extent a fallacy of composition whereby regulators and supervisors believed that by focusing on the health of individual firms, systemic stability would be ensured. This approach of course ignored not only the externalities associated with some activities and but also the fact that apparently rational behaviour on the part of an individual firm may create collectively unsustainable conditions in the market as a whole. In short, the system did not pay due attention to macroprudential supervision and the maintenance of systemic stability.",,,,Macroprudential Supervision in Insurance,Springer Nature,,,2014,2014,,2014,,,209-229,Closed,Chapter,"Mawdsley, Andrew","Mawdsley, Andrew ()",,"Mawdsley, Andrew ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021724588,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

A large amount of research has been conducted to explore policy solutions to this problem.

This paper develops a comprehensive understanding of systemic risk, by using the theoretical framework provided by Perrow in his seminal book, ‘Normal Accidents’.

The banking sector influences the whole economy through the credit channel and balances its stability. The interplay of these elements motivated our main question, whether ESG scores impact European financial stability, measured for the banking sector. To this aim, we employ the cross-quantilogram methodology, which explores dependences at all levels of the distributions of two random variables. To determine the quantile dependence, we resort to methods of measuring systemic risk (Marginal Expected Shortfall—MES, CoVaR, and ΔCoVaR) for all commercial banks listed on European stock exchanges. While our approach provides a dashboard for analysis of the dependence of financial stability on ESG pillars, our findings indicate that such a connection is valid and cannot be identified with standard approaches that explore average distribution levels.

202,pub.1102354595,10.2139/ssrn.2144841,,,,"Municipal Securities: The Crisis of State and Local Government Indebtedness, Systemic Costs of Low Default Rates, and Opportunities for Reform","Municipal securities are securities issued by state and local governments to pay for public infrastructure, public services and to meet day-to-day funding needs. The conventional wisdom says that municipal securities are low risk because issuers rarely default. Municipal issuers rarely default because they pledge their taxing power or dedicated revenue streams for repayment, and thus must raise taxes and/or cut spending if necessary to avoid default. Other legal, political and economic constraints also make it difficult for issuers (and thus taxpayers) to obtain relief from municipal bond debt. This state of affairs means that when issuers take steps to avoid default and reduce investor risk of loss (as they must), they increase risks and costs for taxpayers responsible for paying back municipal bond debt. In this way, the low default rate for municipal securities increases risks and costs for those whose credit backstops municipal securities debt. As it stands today, the federal securities regulatory regime applicable to the municipal securities market reflects an investor-centric, default-centric approach to risk. Under the current regime, obligated stakeholders must disclose certain facts relating to default risk to investors. Once that occurs, risk is an economic issue to be dealt with through pricing and deal terms, not a subject of regulatory concern. In this article, I argue that the conventional approach to risk is inadequate, because it ignores and externalizes risks and costs that issuers and taxpayers face when communities use debt and derivatives to finance infrastructure and public services. Since these risks and costs impact millions of taxpayers, and can have a devastating effect on public and private life, I argue that they ought to be subjects of regulatory scrutiny under the federal securities laws. This article proposes a series of regulatory reforms designed to bring taxpayer risk into the regulatory conversation, including the following: (i) apply fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to underwriters, derivatives dealers and public officials when they provide advice to issuers respecting the structure, timing and terms of municipal bond offerings and derivatives transactions or serve as derivatives counterparties; (ii) expand and formalize risk identification and tracking systems so that stakeholders will have a better chance of identifying systemic risks to all stakeholders (including taxpayers) before a crisis erupts; (iii) implementing systems to track and monitor the effectiveness of regulatory reforms, so that we can leverage successful strategies and avoid (or at least mitigate the impact of) mistakes.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2012,2012,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Chung, Christine Sgarlata","Chung, Christine Sgarlata (Albany Law School)",,"Chung, Christine Sgarlata (Albany Law School)",Albany Law School,grid.417841.f,Albany,New York,United States,,,,,,1,0,,0.64,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102354595,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",,,,,,C18 Law,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

We base our analysis on new findings in the field of ideational shifts and regulatory science, which posit that change-agents engage with new ideas pragmatically and strategically in their effort to have their economic ideas institutionalized. We argue that in these epistemic battles over new regulation, scientific backing by academia is the key resource determining the outcome. We show that the present reforms implemented internationally follow this pattern. In our analysis we contrast the entire discourse on systemic risk and macroprudential regulation with Borio’s initial 2003 proposal for a macroprudential framework. We find that mostly cross-sectional measures targeted towards increasing the resilience of the financial system rather than inter-temporal measures dampening the financial cycle have been implemented. We provide evidence for the lacking support of new macroprudential thinking within academia and argue that this is partially responsible for the lack of anti-cyclical macroprudential regulation. Most worryingly, the financial cycle is largely absent in the academic discourse and is only tacitly assumed instead of fully fledged out in technocratic discourses, pointing to the possibility that no anti-cyclical measures will be forthcoming.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Ibrocevic, Edin; Thiemann, Matthias","Ibrocevic, Edin (Goethe University Frankfurt, Students); Thiemann, Matthias (Goethe University Frankfurt)",,"Ibrocevic, Edin (Goethe University Frankfurt); Thiemann, Matthias (Goethe University Frankfurt)",Goethe University Frankfurt,grid.7839.5,Frankfurt am Main,Hessen,Germany,,,,,,1,1,,0.49,,http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/46680/SSRN-id3195910.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105690970,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Financial Openness and the Challenge of Global Governance,"This chapter studies the globalization of finance. The world economy today reflects a systemic experiment involving, on the one hand, the unleashing of cross-border capital movements and, on the other, the dispersion of the political authority necessary to oversee and, when necessary, stabilize the markets through which vast amounts of capital now flow. Resulting tensions become most obvious during financial crises, when those flows suddenly stop or reverse their direction. In the late twentieth century, most such crises began in emerging-market or developing countries and had limited systemic consequences. In 2008, however, the global experiment capital market openness, now far along in its evolution, almost failed catastrophically when policy mistakes in the United States combined with large national payments' imbalances and a broad economic downturn to spawn a worldwide emergency. Shortly thereafter, Europeans at the core of the system narrowly escaped a similar disaster at the regional level. The chapter then explores key implications for contemporary global governance. It calls particular attention to the increasingly difficult and variegated politics of systemic risk assessment, emergency management, and future crisis prevention as the experiment continues.",,,,Global Political Economy,Oxford University Press (OUP),,,2020-04-14,2020,2020-08,2020-04-14,,,222-246,Closed,Chapter,"Pauly, Louis W.","Pauly, Louis W.

We show that the liquidity crunch in Retail-NBFCs stemmed from their over-dependence on short-term wholesale funding from Liquid Debt Mutual Funds (LDMFs) and the low level of high-quality liquid investments in the LDMF sector. While such reliance worked well in good times, it generated significant short-term debt rollover problems for Retail-NBFCs during times of stress. The key reason for the inability of Retail-NBFCs to roll over commercial paper was the transmission of systemic risk from Retail-NBFCs to the LDMF sector. Anticipating defaults by Retail-NBFCs, mutual fund investors exited from the LDMF sector. The low levels of high-quality liquid assets in the LDMF sector were insufficient to withstand the concerted redemption pressure by investors and made the LDMF sector reluctant to roll over short-term debt of Retail-NBFCs. We develop a robust tool (Health Score) to estimate financial fragility in a Retail-NBFCs and find that it can predict the constraints on external financing (or rollover risk) faced by these firms.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Anshuman, V.

                  This paper finds noninterest income is positively correlated with the total systemic risk for U.S. banks. Decomposing total systemic risk into three components, we find that noninterest income is positively related to a bank’s tail risk, positively related to a bank’s interconnectedness risk, and an insignificantly related to a bank’s exposure to macroeconomic and finance factors. We also find that noninterest income is more volatile and negatively related to interest income. Finally, we find trading and other noninterest income to be positively correlated with systemic risk. Other noninterest income, compared with trading income, has a slightly larger economic impact. (JEL G01, G18, G20, G21, G32, G38)

In Italy the shadow banking system is fully regulated, mostly following the principle of same business-same rules or ‘bank-equivalent regulation’. After an overview of the topic, we describe the Italian shadow banking system and the related regulatory and supervisory framework in place before the financial crisis and the subsequent enhancements. A quantitative representation of Italian shadow banking is also provided.

We have developed a microcomputer-based data handling system for evaluating vascular patients that is inexpensive ($6000 to $8000), easy to use, and flexible. Its simplicity for nonprogrammers is achieved through a natural interface with menu-driven operations and descriptive English language messages. With this system eight data entry forms were designed, and data on more than 1000 patients treated for peripheral vascular disease over the last 7 years were entered into the computer by clerical personnel with minimal training. A query language report generator allowed us to obtain reports of results in simple English on any set of selection criteria with all relevant statistical functions, including cumulative life-table patency rates. This system has the following advantages: rapid evaluation of data from several retrospective and prospective studies, such as comparison of graft material, effect of local and systemic risk factors, cost of limb-salvage surgery, and correlation of noninvasive laboratory tests with other parameters; more accurate patient follow-up, with elimination of many of the pitfalls involved in observing large groups of patients frequently; and quantitation of individual surgeon or service results for quality control and self-review, which guide the vascular surgeon to modify treatment protocols, patient selection, and/or surgical techniques.

This period is characterised by several events that affected energy source markets: the real effect of the global financial crisis, the explosion of shale production and the diffusion of the Covid-19 pandemic. The price of oil and natural gas showed extreme swings, impacting companies’ financial situations, which, accompanied by technological developments in shale production, had an impact on the debt issuance and on the overall risk level of the oil and natural gas sector. By studying the systemic impact of oil and natural gas companies on risk in the financial market, measured by the Δ CoVaR, we observe that in the most recent decade, their role is sensibly increasing compared to 2000–2010, even accounting for the possible effect associated with the increase in companies’ sizes. In addition, our results show evidence of a decreasing relevance of traditional drivers of systemic risk, suggesting that additional factors might be present.

It has been shown that, in order to achieve an accurate reconstruction, it is crucial to reliably replicate the empirical degree sequence, which is however unknown in many realistic situations. More recently, it has been found that the knowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the strength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the total number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational requirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure valid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that, apart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network is homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling subsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of sampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased towards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our core technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the unknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data sets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect to the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever the available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes.","This work was supported by the EU projects CoeGSS (grant num. 676547), Multiplex (grant num. 317532), Shakermaker (grant num. 687941), SoBigData (grant num. 654024), GrowthCom (grant num. 611272) and the FET projects SIMPOL (grant num. 610704) and DOLFINS (grant num. 640772).

This step bears two important meanings. First, it epitomises the response of European regulators and policy makers to the wave of financial crises that started in 2007–2008. Second, it represents an irrevocable step towards European integration. By setting a level playing field for all banks in Europe, it is intended to foster fairness and competition, and to eliminate the scope for strategic interaction among uncoordinated national supervisors witnessed so far. This book embarks on an assessment of the current state and future prospects of financial regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. The analysis takes a broad view, encompassing banks as well as households in their saving and borrowing activities. The volume starts by revisiting the logical steps required to move financial regulation from a micro-prudential to a macro-prudential perspective, the necessity of which has been much emphasised following the 2007 crisis, with a view to limiting the scope for further bank panics. A number of chapters are devoted to dissecting actual experiences and crisis events that occurred in Europe, ranging from various debt and banking crises to the experiences gained by the working of bodies such as the European Systemic Risk Board or the Liikanen Group. These analyses draw lessons and conclusions, but also critiques, through the lenses of academic reasoning. A number of chapters innovate, by blending an economic and a legal perspective when analysing aspects of financial regulation (like banking competition), while others try to envisage how economists and lawyers can work together to design efficient and fair regulations. The book does not neglect interactions between policies: to this purpose, some authors evaluate the delicate role of lender of last resort to complement financial regulation in achieving financial stability. In its second part, the book sets a pathway for approaching a gaping hole in the current apparatus of European regulation, namely provisions for investors' protection. Indeed, while the Dodd-Frank Act in its Title IX introduces norms and regulations for investors' protection, Europe still features a quite fragmented and insufficient map for regulation of how investors and borrowers can be protected from inappropriate financial products or uninformed usage thereof.",,,,Financial Regulation,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,,2015,2015,2015,2015,,,xxi-xxiii,Closed,Chapter,"Faia, Ester; Hackethal, Andreas; Haliassos, Michael; Langenbucher, Katja","Faia, Ester (); Hackethal, Andreas (); Haliassos, Michael (); Langenbucher, Katja ()",,"Faia, Ester (); Hackethal, Andreas (); Haliassos, Michael (); Langenbucher, Katja ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019270759,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

The application of these different measures to both conventional and Islamic stock indexes for developed and emerging countries in the context of the financial crisis yields two interesting results.

To better understand the potential effectiveness of a macro-prudential time varying tax/subsidy on debt/dividends, we empirically estimate the impact of an Islamic financing presence on financial crises. Adherence to Islamic financing principles for a nontrivial portion of a country’s population has similar impacts to a macro-prudential policy in that these limited asset holders are likely to hold less debt or use debt-like instruments rather than conventional debt, driving down their marginal rate of substitution and the price of equity in equilibrium. To empirically estimate the effects of this policy, we interact an Islamic financing variable with debt in an otherwise standard model of financial crises. The results show that this macro-prudential-like policy decreases the likelihood of a banking crisis by 50%. The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we show that an Islamic finance presence encourages precautionary savings like a macro-prudential policy. Second, using an Islamic finance presence to capture macro-prudential potential effects, we find empirically that the likelihood of banking crises are cut roughly by half when such policies are in effect.",,,Applied Economics Letters,,Taylor & Francis,"1744-6546, 1744-6554, 1350-4851, 1466-4291",,2018-02-02,2018,2018-02-02,2019-01-02,26,1,27-31,Closed,Article,"Smith, Katherine A.","Smith, Katherine A.

Early detection and treatment is mainstay of prevention of blindness from glaucoma. Purpose: This study was done to assess the perception and glaucoma screening practice of ophthalmologist in Nigeria. Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. A pretested structured questionnaire was administered to all the ophthalmologists who attended the general plenary session of the 2013 annual conference of the Ophthalmological Society of Nigeria (OSN). Result: Of the 115 respondents, 63 (54.8%) were females; mean age was 39.7 ± 9.3 years. Majority 69 (60.0%) were less than 40 years old. Presence of systemic risk factors to glaucoma was reported by 19 (16.5%), out of which 9 (47.4%) were hypertension, 2 (10.5%) were Diabetes Mellitus, 2 (10.5%) were other cardiovascular diseases, and 6 were unspecified others. Among the respondents, 28 (24.3%) had positive family history; 29 (25.2%) had Myopia; and 3 (2.6%) were known glaucoma patients already on treatment. Majority 91 (79.1%) had positive attitude towards glaucoma screening. Although 98 (85.2%) have ever had a full eye examination, only 56 (48.7%) were routine. There was no statistically significant relationship between sex, age group, religion, positive family history, professional status, attitude and glaucoma screening.

The participatory countries of the Paris Agreement agreed to align finance flows with a low-emission, low-carbon and climate-resilient growth, in order to facilitate achieving the long-term climate goals. The financial sector, therefore, needs to play a proactive role in aligning financial flows. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to study low-carbon finance and climate-related financial risks. This chapter examine how climate change can affect the financial sector. It discusses the concept, nature, measurement of climate risks and climate-related financial risks and associated prospects and challenges in the assessment and the measurement of these risks. It also presents the green financing initiatives and role of central banks and supervisory authorities and their monetary and financial policies in enhancing green financing and redirecting finance to low-carbon activities. In the financial sector, the insurance industry is highly vulnerable to such risks. The banking sector is yet to witness the serious impact of these risks. With the slowing of global economic growth, appropriate policies are needed to encourage banks to provide increased green finance with an adequate profitability. Studies recommend that climate-related risk has a strong potential impact on banks’ loan default rate as well as on the financial stability, there is hence a need to incorporate climate-related criteria and the systemic risk arising out of climate change into banks’ decision-making process and risk modelling and management. There is a need for developing an appropriate methodology for assessing and reducing these risks. Moreover, observers also anticipate a need for cooperation between banking regulators and banks to develop and adopt best practices in the management of environmental risks. The environment-related risks will call forth a multi-country, or regional, research office to collect and compile the required data and undertake analysis to enhance the banking sectors’ understanding of, and capacity to address, potential systemic environmental risks.

On that basis, the G20 Coherent Conclusions for the Management of Capital Flows Drawing on Country Experiences was established in 2011, followed by discussions among policy circles including the OECD and IMF. Emerging economies have also taken various policy measures to manage systemic risks associated with cross-border capital flows. In 2010, the Korean government and central bank announced foreign exchange-related macroprudential measures (MPMs) aimed at building resilience against external financial shocks. These measures have greatly contributed to limiting systemic risk by curbing excessive capital inflows. Twelve years have passed since the global financial crisis started, and ten years after the introduction of FX-related macroprudential policy measures in Korea. It is now an opportune time to check the performance and effectiveness of these policies. Given the newly heightened risky environment, it is urgent to discuss how to improve macroprudential measures in response to emerging external risks. Chapter 2 reviews trends in macroprudential policies from a global perspective, and approaches by several international organizations to cross-border capital flow management measures. The IMF and OECD take different approaches to capital flow management measures to mitigate volatility in capital flows in emerging counties. Such conflicting signals from the OECD and IMF regarding those macroprudential measures make it difficult for emerging counties to implement tools relevant for themselves. Cooperation between the IMF and OECD is essential to enhance the consistency between the IMF’s institutional view and OECD approaches for the management of capital flows. Chapter 3 analyzes the determinants of macroprudential policy measures in the external sectors and examines the empirical effects of these measures. As determinants of capital flows, pull factors (private credit, foreign exchange reserves, and economic size) as well as push factors (the VIX index) were significantly associated with cross-border capital flows. An analysis reveals that reinforcement of capital inflow regulations and deregulation of capital outflows were significantly related with a depreciation of domestic currency. We also find that the strengthening regulations on capital inflows had a large effect on scaling down capital inflows, and deregulation on capital outflows also lowered the accumulation of net capital inflows. Further analysis also reveals that deregulation of capital outflows is significantly associated with lower volatility of portfolio investment. In Chapter 4, we check the performance and effectiveness of FX-related macroprudential measures in Korea. In 2010, Korea’s authorities introduced three-pronged macroprudential policies ‒ a regulation on the ratio of FX derivatives position, an FX stability levy, and a tax on bond investment by foreigners ‒ in order to mitigate volatility from capital flows. These measures are considered to have contributed greatly to easing vulnerabilities in the FX sector through curtailment of external debt in the banking sector and improvements in maturity structures. In particular, the short-term portion out of total external debt in foreign bank branches has declined greatly. In March 2020, the authorities relaxed FX macroprudential regulations in a flexible manner to cope with external shocks triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. In Chapter 5, we make an effort to identify new types of risks unanticipated by policy authorities and to recognize thin markets usually ignored due to their relatively small business sizes. The Covid-19 pandemic led to globally tighter US dollar funding conditions as the US dollar money market became severely strained. Under these circumstances, it also tightened the local financial conditions in Korea, which remain heavily exposed to US dollar funding risks. Finally, based on the analysis outcome, we suggest the following policy implications. Korea’s FX-related macroprudential policies greatly contributed to stabilizing systemic risk by curbing excessive capital inflows to Korea since its 2010 introduction of macroprudential measures. However, it is necessary to note that financial stability is threatened by potential risks not comparable with risks in the past. In particular, the global financial market is now grappling with difficulties in funding the US dollar. This indicates that the Korean authorities should strengthen monitoring of changing trends in the international financial market, while prioritizing to secure enough US dollar liquidity during a crisis. As a result, it is critical to sustain a resilient framework for curbing excessive capital inflow, but to respond with caution to the trend of decreasing capital inflow. In this regard the current macroprudential system in the external sector – introduced to mainly curb excessive capital inflow – should be overhauled.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"An, Sungbae; Kang, Tae Soo; Kim, Kyunghun; Kang, Eun Jung","An, Sungbae (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy); Kang, Tae Soo (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)); Kim, Kyunghun (Hongik University); Kang, Eun Jung (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy)",,"An, Sungbae (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy); Kang, Tae Soo (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology); Kim, Kyunghun (Hongik University); Kang, Eun Jung (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy)",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy; Hongik University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,grid.464610.1; grid.412172.3; grid.37172.30,Sejong; Seoul; Daejeon,; ; ,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140786807,"47 Language, Communication and Culture; 4703 Language Studies",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

But, surprisingly, the gains that can be achieved through greater co-ordination of rules and their application across jurisdictions remain largely under-analysed. This volume complements the stocktaking report on International Regulatory Co-operation: Rules for a Global World by providing evidence on regulatory co-operation in the area of transboundary water management and through the fast development of transnational private regulation.This title belongs to OECD Report Series.ISBN: 9781780405537 (eBook)",,,Water Intelligence Online,,IWA Publishing,1476-1777,,2013-07,2013,2013-07,,12,,9781780405537,Closed,Article,"Co-Operation and Development, Organisation for Economic","Co-Operation and Development, Organisation for Economic ()",,"Co-Operation and Development, Organisation for Economic ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069133755,48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law,,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

It discusses the macro- and micro-prudential competences of the specialised agencies that are now ranging from direct supervision of individual financial institutions to the ability to impose market-wide restrictions on financial activities. The regulatory response to the financial crisis of 2007/08 centralised and strengthened the EU competences of monitoring financial markets and enforcing cooperation between the national competent authorities, especially in cross-border situations. It is however observed that – with some notable exceptions – the supervisory model in the European Union remains fragmented. Lack of direct supervisory powers – especially in the securities and payments markets – means that many international institutions remain without appropriate supervision. This results not only in weaker consumer protection and increased systemic risk, but also in jurisdictional arbitrage and, ultimately, damaged competitiveness of the European financial sector.",,,Annual Center Review,,University of Bialystok,"1899-5942, 18995942",,2022,2022,,2022,,14-15,14-21,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Głuchowski, Jan; Górski, Krzysztof Adam","Głuchowski, Jan (); Górski, Krzysztof Adam ()",,"Głuchowski, Jan (); Górski, Krzysztof Adam ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://repozytorium.uwb.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/11320/13807/1/ACR_14_15_2021_2022_J_Gluchowski_KA_Gorski_Regulation_of_financial_supervision.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150865135,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",,,,,,C18 Law,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

We find strong and robust evidence that central bank independence and its four dimensions (personnel independence, financial independence, policy independence, and central bank objectives) are negatively associated with bank systemic risk. In addition, the results indicate that the reductive effect of central bank independence on systemic risk is more pronounced during actual episodes of banking crises. Moreover, our results suggest that the democratic environment plays a vital role in moderating the central bank independence − systemic risk nexus.","We thank Anil V.

This systemic risk like no other at a time of record-breaking debt levels, especially among nonfinancial firms across the world, could exacerbate corporate vulnerabilities, deepen macro-financial instability, and cause long-lasting damage to economic potential. Using data on more than 2.8 million nonfinancial firms from 52 countries during the period 1997-2018, we develop a two-pronged approach to investigate the relationship between corporate leverage and fixed investment spending. The empirical analysis, robust to a battery of sensitivity checks, confirm corporate leverage is highly vulnerable to disruptions in profitability and cash flow at the firm level and economic growth at the aggregate level.

The article is devoted to the problem of state regulation of the processes of convergence of air transport of Ukraine to the European Union (EU), the relevance of which is confirmed in the National Transport Strategy of Ukraine for the period until 2030 and the draft Plan for the Recovery of Ukraine. Analysis of recent research and publications. An overview of foreign and domestic scientific research on the problems of state regulation of air transport is presented. Setting the task, the goal of the research. The purpose of the article is to determine the problems and methods of state regulation of the processes of convergence of aviation transport of Ukraine to the EU and outline the means of their implementation. Highlighting unexplored parts of the general problem. Despite the large number of studies on the problems of state regulation of air transport, it is necessary to note the insufficiency of scientific works on this issue. Presentation of the main material. The author identified the systemic risks of the economic stability of the functioning of the aviation transport of Ukraine in the conditions of war and post-war recovery and the key actions to reduce them. The methods of state regulation of the processes of convergence of air transport of Ukraine to the EU (increasing the level of security; progressive liberal policy; deregulation of economic activity; promotion of foreign economic and international legal activity; technical improvement; introduction of information technologies) and the means of their implementation are given. Conclusions according to the article. Ukraine's signing of the Common Aviation Space Agreement with the EU countries contributes to the development of the domestic aviation industry and provides for the unification of the air transport markets of our country and the EU, the removal of barriers, which will contribute to the development of Ukraine's transit potential and integration into European aviation structures, strengthening the country's authority on the international the arena. During the post-war recovery of Ukraine, it is necessary to introduce new methods of state regulation of the processes of convergence of air transport to the EU: introduction of airspace free routes; development of the institute of the authorized economic operator; transformation of traditional airports into ecosystems; use of digitization, modern technologies of air traffic management, biometrics, artificial intelligence, electronic document management.",,,University Economic Bulletin,,Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi Hryhorii Skovoroda State Pedagogical University,"2306-546X, 2414-3774",,2023-03-31,2023,2023-03-31,,,56,54-60,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kudrytska, Natalia","Kudrytska, Natalia (Institute for Economics and Forecasting of NAS of Ukraine)",,"Kudrytska, Natalia ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://economic-bulletin.com/index.php/journal/article/download/948/934,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157489385,48 Law and Legal Studies; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5004 Religious Studies,,,,,,C19 Politics and International Studies,,dims

METHODS: This retrospective, institutional, case control study included 499 patients, wherein 262 patients diagnosed as acute CSCR, were compared with an age and gender matched control group of 237 patients. All patients were evaluated with a detailed systemic and ocular history, objective and subjective refractions for both eyes and complete ocular examination by a retina specialist, at all visits. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the diagnosis of CSCR.
RESULTS: The mean age was found to be 40±7y in the study group (Group 1) compared to 38±10y in the control group (Group 2). Most common refractive status in the study group, was emmetropia seen in 191 patients (72.9%), followed by hypermetropia seen in 47 patients (17.9%) and astigmatism seen in 21 patients (8.0%). Only 3 subjects (1.1%) had myopia, which was less than or equal to 1.0 D, compared to 70 subjects (29.5%) in the control group, suggesting a statistically significant lower incidence of CSCR among the myopic patients (P< 0.0001). With respect to the systemic factors, 26 (9.9%) patients were using systemic steroids in the study group (Group 1) compared to none in the control group (Group 2) suggesting a statistically significant association of CSCR with systemic steroid use (P<0.05). No other significant systemic risk factors were noted.
CONCLUSION: Though CSCR is a multifactorial disease, myopia serves as a protective factor for CSCR. Thus, myopic eyes are less likely to develop CSCR. Since both retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris are postulated in the pathogenesis of CSCR, chorio-retinal thinning and atrophy seen in myopic eyes are less likely to cause CSCR.",,,International Journal of Ophthalmology,,Press of International Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO Press),"2222-3959, 2227-4898",,2016-02-18,2016,2016-02-18,2016-02-18,9,2,266-270,All OA; Gold,Article,"Manayath, George J; Arora, Saurabh; Parikh, Hardik; Shah, Parag K; Tiwari, Sarvesh; Narendran, Venkatapathy","Manayath, George J (Department of Retina and Ocular Oncology, Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore 641 014, Tamil Nadu, India.); Arora, Saurabh (Department of Retina and Ocular Oncology, Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore 641 014, Tamil Nadu, India.); Parikh, Hardik (Department of Retina and Ocular Oncology, Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore 641 014, Tamil Nadu, India.); Shah, Parag K (Department of Retina and Ocular Oncology, Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore 641 014, Tamil Nadu, India.); Tiwari, Sarvesh (Department of Retina and Ocular Oncology, Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore 641 014, Tamil Nadu, India.); Narendran, Venkatapathy (Department of Retina and Ocular Oncology, Aravind Eye Hospital, Coimbatore 641 014, Tamil Nadu, India.)",,"Manayath, George J (Aravind Eye Hospital); Arora, Saurabh (Aravind Eye Hospital); Parikh, Hardik (Aravind Eye Hospital); Shah, Parag K (Aravind Eye Hospital); Tiwari, Sarvesh (Aravind Eye Hospital); Narendran, Venkatapathy (Aravind Eye Hospital)",Aravind Eye Hospital,grid.413854.f,Madurai,Tamil Nadu,India,,,,,,28,10,1.9,6.59,1.0,https://doi.org/10.18240/ijo.2016.02.16,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1068591044,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences,Eye,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,"A01 Clinical Medicine; A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

The information linkages between two funds with large positions in the same stock are hypothesized to be connected to each other. Then, we use the information sharing efficiency in the fund networks to study the effects of information transmission on stock market extreme risk and financial systemic risk. Especially, the speed of information diffusion in the network is characterized by the topology structures based on social network theory. Empirical research studies find that the Chinese fund information network exhibits small-world characteristics, which reflects rapid speed of information diffusion. Seen from the idiosyncratic risk of volatility, information sharing of institutional investors can improve the behavior consistency of fund managers, thus increasing the stock volatility via herd effects. Besides, it can be concluded that institutional investor information sharing can reduce the extreme risk by promoting the comprehensiveness of information flow and the market pricing efficiency of stocks, thereby reducing the degree of financial systemic risk. The obtained conclusions provide suggestions for decision-making of institutional investors. It can help the regulators to pay attention to the herd effects so as to control systemic risk.","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 71901130, 71532009, and 71790594), Shandong Social Science Planning Project (no. 19CJRJ21), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M641653).",,Complexity,,Hindawi,"1076-2787, 1099-0526",,2020-04-09,2020,,2020-04-09,2020,,1-10,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gong, Xiao-Li; Du, Zhi-Qiang","Gong, Xiao-Li (School of Economics, Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266061, China); Du, Zhi-Qiang (School of Economics, Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266061, China)","Gong, Xiao-Li (Qingdao University)","Gong, Xiao-Li (Qingdao University); Du, Zhi-Qiang (Qingdao University)",Qingdao University,grid.410645.2,Qingdao,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,,China; China,grant.8869486; grant.8327266; grant.8322581,71901130; 71790594; 71532009,3,3,,,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/5745916.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126501867,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences,Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Most of the existing literature links the credit boom to the emergence of the shadow banking system. This paper shows that the largest part of the shadow banking system merely transforms existing financial claims against ultimate borrowers that have been originated by traditional banks. Based on financial accounts data, it is estimated that, shortly before the onset of the financial crisis, just about 12% of loans to the non-financial private sector had been originated by shadow banks. Consequently, dampening credit creation by the traditional banking sector might be an additional policy instrument to reduce the build-up of systemic risk in the shadow banking system.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Unger, Robert","Unger, Robert (Deutsche Bundesbank)",,"Unger, Robert (Deutsche Bundesbank)",Deutsche Bundesbank,grid.478692.6,Frankfurt am Main,,Germany,,,,,,7,2,,2.82,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/130751/1/857682997.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142665585,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

It also features a temporal dimension related to the inappropriate responses of financial market participants to changes in risk over time. This paper proposes a method to simultaneously address the cross-sectional and the time dimension in which systemic risk materializes. The method is based on the TOPHITS algorithm. It provides three scores, namely borrowing, lending and time scores: the first two represent the systemic importance of the borrowing and the lending activity associated with each financial institution,while the third represents an empirical Early Warning Signal of the financial crisis.

The equivalence among Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios, node degree distribution and capital allocation distribution is established with a Havel–Hakimi network structure. Such equivalences allow network entropy to be a measure of portfolio diversification and robustness. Our empirical analysis finds a linear correlation between in-sample network entropy and out-of-sample portfolio returns. Then, a return-entropy efficient frontier is introduced to interpret the return-diversification trade-offs. Further, we compare the out-of-sample performance of portfolios optimized with PEN analysis against those optimized with mean–variance analysis, showing that PEN-optimized portfolios outperform mean–variance efficient portfolios in returns, given a low-to-medium P/E ratio level. This outcome accords with the P/E effect that stocks with low P/E ratios are undervalued and will provide increased returns in the future. In addition, regarding global financial risk events such as the financial crisis in 2008, the Euro debt crisis in 2013 and Brexit in 2016, this study finds that the PEN-optimized portfolio size increased significantly (even to more than 300 stocks) to mitigate systemic risk, while mean–variance efficient portfolios were not sufficiently diversified.",,,International Journal of Modern Physics B,,World Scientific Publishing,"0217-9792, 1793-6578",,2022-05-31,2022,2022-05-31,2022-07-30,36,19,2250107,Closed,Article,"Yan, Xiangzhen; Yang, Hanchao; Hou, Chunxiao; Zhang, Shuguang; Zhu, Peican","Yan, Xiangzhen (Department of Statistics and Finance, School of Management, Centre for Financial Security Studies, International Institute of Finance, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

This paper begins by reviewing some of the rich and rapidly growing legal scholarship related to surveillance capitalism.The authors introduce their recent observations on the use of data by businesses. We then offer a hopeful counter-narrative: that the deep integration of widespread data collection, if steered appropriately, could actually be a part of the solution to the widely acknowledged blind spots of short-termism in capitalism as practiced until the present moment at the dawn of the third decade of this millennium.The authors offer a new model of feedback loops and apply it to this arena of legal scholarship alongside principles borrowed from Native wisdom traditions. This simple-but-profound model could help attorneys, their business clients, and public policymakers to consider the collection-and-use of data in a way that advances longer-term and holistic thinking, curbing all-to-familiar systemic risks.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Sulkowski, Adam J.; Blanch-Hartigan, Danielle; Goldberg, Caren Beth; Verbos, Amy Klemm; Bu, Maoliang; Nuñez, Remy Michael Balarezo","Sulkowski, Adam J.

This is so even if the regulatory and supervisory regimes are in many respects effective. The capacity of government to intervene may determine whether the distress is confined to the financial sector or breaks out into the real economy. Although adequate resolution authority to address a failing financial firm is a necessary objective of the current regulatory reform, a firm-by-firm approach will be unable to address a major systemic failure such as the Crisis of 2007-08, which may require capital support of the financial sector to avoid severe economic harm. We therefore propose standby systemic emergency finding authority, triggered by agreement among Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC. Such a fund, scaled appropriately to the size of the US economy, $1 trillion, should be funded (and partially pre-funded) by risk-adjusted assessments on all large financial firms, who benefit from systemic stability. Standby emergency authority avoids the need for high stakes legislative action mid-crisis, which can be destabilizing even if successful and catastrophic if not. The triple key‖ constraint and on-going monitoring and oversight should address concerns of legitimacy and accountability.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2010,2010,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gordon, Jeffrey N.; Muller, Christopher","Gordon, Jeffrey N.

Design/methodology/approach – The empirical analysis is based on estimates through ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized method of moments (GMM), system of equations through GMM (system-GMM), and impulse response functions through vector autoregressive (VAR).   Findings – The results suggest that monetary policies and prudential regulation affect aggregate investment through the bank lending channel. With regards to elasticities, the findings indicate that the credit is very sensitive to variations in economic activity and, in turn, prudential regulation presents a stronger influence on credit than the basic interest rate and the reserve requirement rate. Moreover, the estimates suggest that aggregate investment is more sensitive to entrepreneurs’ expectations and credit supply.   Practical implications – Aiming to reduce systemic risk in the economy, capital requirements may be increased in order to induce banks to a lower risk exposure by reducing the supply of loans. However, while this instrument strengthens the banking system, it can also lead the banking system to become less sensitive to monetary policy shocks, and also discourage aggregate demand through the influence that the credit exerts on investments. As a consequence, prudential regulation is an important tool because it acts on the balance between economic growth and low risk exposure of banks.   Originality/value – The paper provides useful insights to academicians, economists and policymakers who are interested in understanding the effects of monetary policies and prudential regulation on aggregate investment through the credit channel in an emerging economy under inflation targeting. Moreover, the paper develops a theoretical model in order to show the influence of different monetary policies, as well as the influence of prudential regulation on the supply of credit.",,,Journal of Economic Studies,,Emerald,"0144-3585, 1758-7387",,2014-11-10,2014,,2014-11-10,41,6,881-906,Closed,Article,"Montes, Gabriel Caldas; do Vale Monteiro, Gabriel Gonçalves","Montes, Gabriel Caldas (Department of Economics, Fluminense Federal University, Niterói, Brazil); do Vale Monteiro, Gabriel Gonçalves (Department of Economics, Fluminense Federal University, Niterói, Brazil)",,"Montes, Gabriel Caldas (Fluminense Federal University); do Vale Monteiro, Gabriel Gonçalves (Fluminense Federal University)",Fluminense Federal University,grid.411173.1,Niterói,,Brazil,,,,,,3,2,,1.15,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015348519,38 Economics; 3802 Econometrics; 3803 Economic Theory,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

We analyse the implied volatility surface (IVS) for each security in the OptionMetrics database. We use implied volatility data across 13 deltas and four expiration dates. Employing methods from principal component analysis (PCA), and results from random matrix theory (RMT), we identify the significant eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of implied volatilities and conclude that, usually, three principal components suffice to reproduce the IVS. In this way we reduce dimensionality of the options market without loosing meaningful information. From this analysis we classify equities into those carrying mostly “systemic” risk and into those carrying mostly “idiosyncratic” risk. Based on the PCA results, we formulate a model which can be used to describe the dynamics of the joint statistics of the IVS of all US options, yet is compact and computationally feasible. Using 9 volatility points to represents each IVS, the model offers significant dimension reduction for each asset as well as for all assets in aggregate. We conclude with a PCA study of the correlation matrix of the entire cross-section equities and options market. We find that the the number of significant factors driving the US equities and options market are as follow: 1. Equities in SPX: 15 significant factors (account for 55% of variance, out of an initial 440 variables). 2. Equities and options with underlying in SPX: 84 significant factors (account for 55% of variance, out of an initial 4400 variables). 3.

The analysis is based on delta conditional value at risk (ΔCoVaR). The UK, France, and Italy significantly contribute to the overall systemic risk in both markets. The USA, the UK, and Russia appear to be important contributors to it in the stock market. In the meantime, the advanced economies exhibit much higher resilience to the systemic risk propagation in comparison with China, Brazil and Russia. Gross government debt to GDP, state fragility index, EU membership and world gross GDP share of a country in distress are key determinants of ΔCoVaRs for the sovereign CDS prices. Stock market total value traded to GDP and world gross GDP share of a country in distress drive ΔCoVaRs in the stock market. In both cases geographic distance tends to deter systemic risk propagation.

Evidence From a Quasi-Natural Experiment,"In this paper I use a quasi-natural experiment - the EBA capital exercise in 2011 - to identify the causal effects of increased capital requirements on the solvency of banks. I focus on market-based measures of solvency, such as market-based leverage, in addition to estimates of banks' systemic risk. My main finding is that market-based measures of bank solvency decreases in response to increased capital requirements. An important contributing factor to this is the adverse effects of capital requirements on the market value of bank equity capital. In order to interpret these findings, I set up a simple model to analyze how capital requirements affect market-based solvency measures for banks. I show that capital requirements can decrease the market value of banks' capital and therefore be counterproductive. I show that this effect is larger for banks that initially are low-capitalized, and provide empirical evidence in support of this.

In patients with marked corneal clouding and visual impairment, penetrating keratoplasty may be considered to improve the patient's vision, functional capacity and quality of life. In MPS, glycosaminoglycans mainly accumulate in the corneal stroma and not in Descemet's membrane or the endothelium, therefore deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) may be preferred in these patients over penetrating keratoplasty. Although there are only limited data on the use of DALK in MPS (I and VI) patients, the results are generally favourable. Nonetheless, when deciding on whether to perform keratoplasty in patients with MPS, the risk of general anaesthesia due to potential concomitant cardio‐pulmonary problems and cervical spine instability, the potential presence of other ocular manifestations that also impair vision (e.g. glaucoma, retinal degeneration and optic atrophy) and/or complications such as allograft rejection and the risk of re‐opacification of the graft, all need to be taken into consideration. Limbal stem cell transplantation, which can be combined with keratoplasty, also holds potential promise in the treatment of these complex cases. A review of the indications, local and systemic risks, techniques of lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty, and the potential of limbal stem cell transplantation is provided in the context of corneal opacity in MPS.","Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Ismar Healthcare NV for their writing assistance, which was funded by BioMarin Europe Ltd.

This is the subject of Chapter 4. There are a few channels that may lead to such an outcome. One is a negative feedback loop between weakening growth and rising financial and economic distress due to already high private debt. A more severe case will be an outright financial crisis resulting from household debt, for example, with a housing market crash or an interest rate shock or a combination of both. Yet another channel is the rise of populism in knee-jerk reactions to the growth deceleration amid rising income inequality and social polarization, which can lead to the adoption of myopic and unsustainable policies that entrench structural rigidities, induce fiscal largesse and rent seeking, and cause macroeconomic volatility, ultimately harming long-term growth further. With deepening political polarization, the lack of effective political mechanism to deal with rising social risks is most concerning. Furthermore, population aging can certainly compound these risks.

Challenges in data management, model hosting and data security are described. Suggestions for establishing a frame of reference for an assessment, and visualizing model outputs are presented. Three operating models for a risk modeling forum that would help decision makers build consensus around data driven analyses are described. Introduction The nation's exposure to financial risk arising from a broad range of diverse and additive effects has gained recent attention from leaders in government and the financial services industry. Models of the financial system are useful to help decision makers understand what is currently happening, and what conditions may exist in the future. They also play an important role in helping policy makers understand the potential impact of regulatory actions that they may consider. There are numerous finance, economic, and risk models that have been developed to represent aspects of the nation's systemic risk. Many of those models are based on different assumptions, or focus on different aspects of the economy. At times, decision makers may seek to form aggregated views from a collection of disparate models. It can also be informative to compare outputs from related models to gain understanding of the ramifications of differing assumptions, and the range of uncertainty embedded in model outputs. This chapter discusses a few of the operational considerations that must be managed to allow an array of those models to be brought together both to form aggregated views of the composite situation, and to perform unbiased comparisons of any conflicting forecasts that they might produce.",,,,Handbook on Systemic Risk,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,,2013-05-23,2013,2013-06-05,2013-05-23,,,869-881,Closed,Chapter,"Worrell, Charles; Guharay, Samar; McMahon, Matt; Seligman, Len; Shenoy, Rajani","Worrell, Charles (); Guharay, Samar (); McMahon, Matt (); Seligman, Len (); Shenoy, Rajani ()",,"Worrell, Charles (); Guharay, Samar (); McMahon, Matt (); Seligman, Len (); Shenoy, Rajani ()",,,,,,,,,,,1,0,,0.35,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029409425,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C20 Social Work and Social Policy,,dims

We determine the contribution of banks to this systemic risk using a generalisation of the Shapley value; a concept originating in co-operative game theory. An important feature of this approach is that the order in which banks fail in response to a shock depends on the composition of the banks’ asset portfolios and capital buffers.

433,pub.1102392393,10.2139/ssrn.2348828,,,,Derivatives Safe Harbors in Bankruptcy and Dodd-Frank: A Structural Analysis,"The Bankruptcy Code exempts financial derivatives and repurchase agreements from key provisions, such as the automatic stay. The primary rationale for this special treatment has been the fear that the failure of an important market participant could cascade if counterparties could not immediately exit their contracts. Reflecting on the recent financial crisis and the Lehman bankruptcy, some scholars have suggested that exempting these financial contracts from bankruptcy may have exacerbated other kinds of systemic risk and contributed to the decision to bail out systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) instead of allowing them to enter bankruptcy. Congress attempted to address this flaw by enacting a Bankruptcy alternative, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, instead of addressing the problems in the Bankruptcy Code safe harbors that were the source of the systemic risk. This article demonstrates that the view that Title II replaces bankruptcy reform is mistaken. Title II actually increases both the need and opportunity to reassess the proper limits of the safe harbors. Without bankruptcy reform, the threat of irreversible damage if the SIFI files bankruptcy before intervention may force Title II to compete with bankruptcy in order to reach potential SIFIs first. However, the difficulty in evaluating whether some firm failures involve systemic risk incentivizes Title II decisionmakers to intervene in cases of doubt, leading to over-intervention, strain on resources and damage to Bankruptcy’s role as the default failure system. In addition, uncertainty over whether Title II will intervene will lead large firms to delay filing bankruptcy far past where resolution is optimal. However, with Bankruptcy reform, the Bankruptcy system would complement and mitigate weaknesses in the Title II safety net. In addition, Title II removes the primary justification for the safe harbors for financial derivatives and repurchase agreements, the fear of the consequences of the bankruptcy of a SIFI. In its wake, the safe harbors for derivative and repo creditors are at odds with powerful fairness and efficiency rationales behind default bankruptcy rules. Dodd-Frank may make Bankruptcy reform easier to achieve and more urgent.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2013,2013,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Adams, Stephen","Adams, Stephen (Harvard University - Law School - Alumni)",,"Adams, Stephen ()",,,,,,,,,,,4,0,,1.4,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102392393,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

VaR is used by bank and insurance regulators more than any other risk measure. A value-at-risk (VaR) constraint on the probability that future firm equity value will be less than a floor, when the floor is zero, is also a constraint on the probability of ruin. A manager who maximizes his firm's expected equity value subject to a VaR constraint, when the firm is in bad financial health, pays a premium for financial instruments that increase his firm's volatility and does the opposite when the firm is in good financial health. Regulations with VaR or probability-of-ruin constraints may increase banks' or insurers' volatility in bad economic conditions. Hence the use of VaR may increase the instability of the global financial network when the financial system is more vulnerable. Basel II regulations, via the Internal Based Ratings Approach, encourage banks with greater systemic risk, the large banks, to use VaR constraints thereby encouraging the banks to which the global financial system is more vulnerable to take on greater risk when it is more vulnerable.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2009,2009,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Eisenberg, Larry","Eisenberg, Larry (New Jersey Institute of Technology)",,"Eisenberg, Larry (New Jersey Institute of Technology)",New Jersey Institute of Technology,grid.260896.3,Newark,New Jersey,United States,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102273712,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

The measure follows the marginal expected shortfall (MES) in that it applied a fixed return threshold when identifying a crisis, but it stipulates the measurement and conditioning variables in the vain of conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR). It is argued that this measure has a theoretical grounding and provides empirical benefits over other measures that have been proposed in the literature. An empirical study that applies various systemic risk measures to the Australian financial sector supports our arguments. In addition, it specifies a correction to the kernel approach for measuring MES and investigate the value of simple measures for calculating contemporaneous risk measures such as MES, SRISK, CoVaR and CoESc.

In recent years, they have been exposed to extreme stress due to the increasing power demand, the introduction of distributed renewable energy sources, and the development of extensive interconnections. We investigate the phenomenon of abrupt breakdown of an electric power-system under two scenarios: load growth (mimicking the ever-increasing customer demand) and power fluctuations (mimicking the effects of renewable sources). Our results indicate that increasing the system size causes breakdowns to become more abrupt; in fact, mapping the system to a solvable statistical-physics model indicates the occurrence of a first order transition in the large size limit. Such an enhancement for the systemic risk failures (black-outs) with increasing network size is an effect that should be considered in the current projects aiming to integrate national power-grids into “super-grids”.","AS acknowledges the support from CNR-PNR National Project Crisis-Lab, EU FET project DOLFINS nr 640772, EU FET project MULTIPLEX nr. 317532 and EU HOME/2013/CIPS/AG/4000005013 project CI2C.

                    The purpose of this paper is to investigate risk dimensions affecting food risk perceptions and to develop effective risk communication strategies based on their risk perceptions dimensions. The reason for writing this paper is that applying single risk communication strategy for public often fails because food risks are systemic risks and public perceptions toward them consist of multiple dimensions. Launching an effective risk communication need to investigate the perception dimensions of the target audience.

                      A total of 2,673 parents of 3-14-year-old children from the rural area of Sichuan province in China were chosen as target audience. Based on the survey conducted about parents’ food risk perceptions, this study used factor-cluster analysis method to segment parents to sub-clusters with significantly different risk perception dimensions. Parents’ representative demographic characteristics within each cluster were further identified through cross-tabs analysis with

And if markets are inefficient, investors can use available information ignored by the market to earn abnormally high returns on their investments. In this context this paper tries to find evidence supporting the reality of weak-form efficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by examining the issues of market risk-return relationship and market depth or liquidity for DSE.

The paper also looks about the market risk (systemic risk) and return where it is found that market rate of return of DSE is very low or sometimes negative. Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which envisages the relationship between risk and the expected rate of return on a risky security, is found unrelated in DSE market. As proper risk-return relationships of the market is seems to be deficient in DSE and the market is not liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being very insignificant.

Among them we discuss the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010) and the Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES) of Acharya, Pedersen, Philippon and Richardson (2011). As systemic risk is highly related to financial contagion, we will explain the drawbacks and advantages of looking at “coexceedances” (simultaneous extreme events) or at the local changes in “correlation” that have been proposed in the literature on financial contagion (Bae, Karolyi and Stulz (2003), Baig and Goldfajn (1999) and Forbes and Rigobon (2002)). Introduction and background on systemic risk During the financial crisis of 2007–2009, worldwide taxpayers had to bailout many financial institutions. Governments are now trying to understand why the regulation failed, why capital requirements were not enough and how a guaranty fund should be built to address the next financial crisis. To implement such a fund, one needs to understand the risk that each institution represents to the financial system and why regulatory capital requirements were not enough. In the financial and insurance industry, capital requirements have the following common properties. First, they depend solely on the distribution of the institution's risk and not on the outcomes in the different states of the world. Second, capital requirements and marginal calculations treat each institution in isolation. An important element is missing in the above assessment of risk: it is the dependency between the individual institution and the economy or the financial system. The regulation should “be regulating each bank as a function of both its joint (correlated) risk with other banks as well as its individual (bank-specific) risk” (Acharya (2009)).",,,,Handbook on Systemic Risk,Cambridge University Press (CUP),,,2013-05-23,2013,2013-06-05,2013-05-23,,,165-179,Closed,Chapter,"Bernard, Carole; Brechmann, Eike Christian; Czado, Claudia","Bernard, Carole (); Brechmann, Eike Christian (); Czado, Claudia ()",,"Bernard, Carole (); Brechmann, Eike Christian (); Czado, Claudia ()",,,,,,,,,,,12,2,,4.19,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024252478,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

There are many systemic risk factors that are related to the appearance and development of atherosclerosis. It has been observed, however, that the lesions occur in specific regions of the arterial tree. Nowadays it is accepted that these regions are the ones with low abnormal values of Wall Shear Stress (WSS). The aim of this work is to generate a platform to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from an LCA, generate a finite element mesh and run a patient specific blood flow simulation in it. The 3D model of the LCA reconstructed was based on a computed tomography (CT) study from a healthy patient. The method used for this procedure consisted basically on three stages: (1) segmenting the LCA principal branches from TC images, (2) extracting several contours from the arteries so as to get the essence of the geometry, applying a self-developed software, and (3) using this outlines to generate a Non-uniform rotational basis spline (NURBS surface). A finite element unstructured volume mesh was generated and refined and a simulation was run on it using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) application. The values of pressure and velocity were analyzed and WSS was computed. As expected, regions of low WSS were found in the outer walls of the bifurcation and in the inner wall of curvatures.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,IOP Publishing,"1742-6588, 1742-6596",,2011-12-23,2011,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,332,1,012048,All OA; Gold,Article,"Salles, Sabina; Salvucci, Fernando P; Craiem, Damian","Salles, Sabina (Universidad Favaloro.

The use of stress tests to manage systemic risk was introduced by the U.S. authorities in 2009 in the form of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. Since then, supervisory authorities in other jurisdictions have also conducted similar exercises. In some of those cases, the design and implementation of certain elements of the framework have been criticized for their lack of credibility. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for constructing an effective crisis stress test. It combines financial markets impact studies of previous exercises with relevant case study information gleaned from those experiences to identify the key elements and to formulate their appropriate design.

295,pub.1122335074,10.2139/ssrn.3474479,,,,Information Asymmetry and the Recent Financial Crisis,"The financial crisis of 2008 was preceded by smaller crises that also produced substantial levels of systemic risk. In addition to their impact on global markets, these lesser events shared several symptoms with the ones that later caused the Great Recession. If regulators and supervisors of the financial industry are to avoid future predicaments, they must monitor indicators beyond the traditional economic parameters. The goal of this paper is to discuss factors that prevented financial regulators from acting on deficiencies found in the financial sector before and during the most recent global financial crisis of 2008. In retrospect, we found that behavioral trends observed during the liquidation of Long-Term Capital Management, a massive hedge fund that failed in 1998 should have warned the regulators about potential risks that were clearly detected in 2008. The inquiry questions on this paper are answered through the analyses of three cases, Long-Term characterizing the crisis of 1998, and Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, investment banks that epitomized the global crisis of 2008. The result of this investigative study shows that several behaviors portrayed by regulators and financial executives throughout the period enabled the chain of events that culminated with the global crisis. This paper analyzes one of them: information asymmetry.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Spina, Joel","Spina, Joel (Collin College; Montereale Consulting; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; University of Phoenix)",,"Spina, Joel ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122335074,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Behavioural Activation (BA) is a brief therapy which demonstrates promising treatment outcomes, although limited qualitative accounts exist of how adolescents experience this. This is one of the first studies undertaken in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to explore the perspectives of adolescent's with low mood who have received BA therapy. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was conducted from one-to-one interviews with nine adolescents who received BA, generating an idiographic account of their experiences. Three superordinate themes emerged: how the format of BA can promote the integration of coping skills into one's life; how interpersonal connections and therapeutic relationships may improve intervention outcomes; and how BA principles could be internalised as part of a young person's day-to-day life. Participants valued the structure and flexibility of the manualised approach, forming an alliance with the therapist, and enhancing interpersonal relationships. This study details how BA can enhance resiliency skills for adolescents experiencing low mood and illustrates some of the change process at inter and intrapersonal levels, which should guide further youth-led research.","We are thankful to the adolescents who took part in this study, to Georgina Beth Hurdsfield for data collection support and to Dr. Bernadka Dubicka who provided overall support and, along with Dr. Susan Marwedel, developed the BA manuals.","FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.",Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry,,SAGE Publications,"1359-1045, 1461-7021",Adolescent; Behavior Therapy; Child; Depression; Humans; Mental Disorders; Treatment Outcome,2021-07-11,2021,2021-07-11,2021-10,26,4,1153-1169,All OA; Green,Article,"Shenton, Naomi; Redmond, Tomos; Kroll, Leo; Parry, Sarah","Shenton, Naomi (Naomi Shenton and Tomos Redmond contributed equally to this paper.); Redmond, Tomos (Naomi Shenton and Tomos Redmond contributed equally to this paper.); Kroll, Leo (Young People's Mental Health Research Unit, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, UK); Parry, Sarah (Young People's Mental Health Research Unit, Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, UK)","Parry, Sarah (Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust)","Shenton, Naomi (); Redmond, Tomos (); Kroll, Leo (Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust); Parry, Sarah (Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust)",Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust,grid.439423.b,Ashton-under-Lyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,3,3,0.71,2.06,3.0,https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/627774/3/Exploring%20Behavioural%20Activation%20as%20a%20treatment%20for%20low%20mood%20within%20CAMHS.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139622053,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Depression; Mental Health; Pediatric,Mental health,7.1 Individual care needs,,,C20 Social Work and Social Policy,3 Good Health and Well Being,dims

As a result, societies are losing a critical public retail payment option, and retail consumers are losing important rights associated with using cash. To address this concern, we propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both e-commerce purchases and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. Our proposal introduces a government-backed, privately-operated digital currency infrastructure to ensure that every transaction is registered by a bank or money services business, and it relies upon non-custodial wallets backed by privacy-enhancing technology, such as blind signatures or zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure that transaction counterparties are not revealed. Our approach to digital currency can also facilitate more efficient and transparent clearing, settlement, and management of systemic risk. We argue that our system can restore and preserve the salient features of cash, including privacy, owner-custodianship, fungibility, and accessibility, while also preserving fractional reserve banking and the existing two-tiered banking system. We also show that it is possible to introduce regulation of digital currency transactions involving non-custodial wallets that unconditionally protect the privacy of end-users.","We thank Tomaso Aste for his continued support for our project, and we thank Larry Wall of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Robleh Ali of the MIT Media Laboratory, and Erica Salinas of the Value Technology Foundation for their valuable feedback.

265,pub.1135444986,10.2139/ssrn.3782675,,,,Market Myopia's Climate Bubble,"A growing number of financial institutions, ranging from BlackRock to the Bank of England, have warned that markets may not be accurately incorporating climate change-related risks into asset prices. This Article seeks to explain how this mispricing can exist at the level of individual assets drawing from scholarship on corporate governance and the mechanisms of market (in)efficiency. Market actors: 1. Lack the fine-grained asset-level data they need in order to assess risk exposure; 2. Continue to rely on outdated means of assessing risk; 3. Have misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate-specific agency costs; 4. Have myopic biases exacerbated by climate change misinformation; and 5. Are impeded by captured regulators distorting the market. Further, trends in institutional share ownership reinforce apathy regarding assessment of firm-specific fundamentals, especially over long-term horizons. This underpricing of corporate climate risk exacerbates the negative effects of climate change itself, as the mispricing of risk in the present leads to a misallocation of investment capital, hindering future adaptation and subsidizing future fossil combustion. These risks could accumulate to the macroeconomic scale, generating a systemic risk to the financial system. While a broad array of government interventions are necessary to mitigate climate related financial risks, this Article focuses on proposals for corporate governance and securities regulation—and their limits. Signals from the Biden Administration suggest that mandatory climate risk disclosure regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission is forthcoming. This Article argues that climate risk disclosure is necessary, though alone not sufficient, to address the widespread disregard of corporate climate exposure.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2021,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Condon, Madison","Condon, Madison (Boston University - School of Law; New York University School of Law)",,"Condon, Madison ()",,,,,,,,,,,3,3,,3.11,,https://dc.law.utah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1314&context=ulr,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135444986,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,13 Climate Action,dims

However, this paper proposes that the argument should take into consideration of financial system risk in terms of macro-prudential policy. The main empirical results using the Korean guarantee insurance data show how much the guarantee insurance is related with the financial system risk in the followings: First, the guarantee insurance is more related with financial system risk than casualty and property insurance. Second, The fat-tail risk of guarantee insurance may prevent the diversification effect of integrating the guarantee insurance business with casualty and property insurance business. The results imply that the integration of guarantee insurance business and casualty and property insurance business into one company may increase the financial system risk in the economy.

The model allows for taking a more holistic approach to interbank contagion than is standard in the literature. A key finding of the paper is that there are material non-linearities in the propagation of shocks to individual banks when taking into account that banks are related to each other in various market segments. The contagion effects when considering the shock propagation simultaneously across multiple layers of interbank networks can be substantially larger than the sum of the contagion-induced losses when considering the network layers individually. In addition, a bank “systemic importance” measure based on the multi-layered network model is developed and is shown to outperform standard network centrality indicators. The finding of non-linear contagion effects when accounting for the interaction between the different layers of banks’ interlinkages have important policy implications. For example, it provides an argument for separating banks’ trading activities from their other intermediation activities.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Montagna, Mattia; Kok, Christoffer","Montagna, Mattia (European Central Bank (ECB)); Kok, Christoffer (European Central Bank (ECB))",,"Montagna, Mattia (); Kok, Christoffer ()",,,,,,,,,,,74,23,,30.28,,https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1944.en.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142669538,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

The systemic risk buildup within the industry is mainly depicted as an unstable, diluted, and possibly depleting process. Gloomy predictions persist in the subsequent attempts to uncover plausible causes of systemic risk formation. Mainly, conventional defining factors for risk exhibit irrelevance toward systemic risk development, as threats to financial stability remain confined within the industry, supported by a lack of diversification in financial services.

SETTING: University hospital, Greece.
SUBJECTS: Abdominal wound dehiscence occurred in 89 cases out of 19,206 major abdominal operations including 4671 emergencies during the past 15 years (0.5%).
INTERVENTIONS: In the study group 14 local and systemic risk factors were analysed and compared with those in a control group of 89 patients who had similar procedures without dehiscence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statistical analysis using the chi square test.
RESULTS: Significant factors (p < 0.05) included age over 65 years, emergency operation, cancer, haemodynamic instability, intra-abdominal sepsis, wound infection, hypoalbuminaemia, ascites, obesity, and steroids. Risk factors that were not significant included sex, anaemia, diabetes mellitus and pulmonary disease. Overall morbidity and mortality were 30% and 16%, respectively.

We first determine by spectral analysis the thresholds above which epidemics/failures can spread; we then calculate the slowest diffusional times. Our results shows that disassortative networks exhibit a higher epidemiological threshold and are therefore easier to immunize, while in assortative networks there is a longer time for intervention before epidemic/failure spreads. Moreover, we study by computer simulations the sandpile cascade model, a diffusive model of distress propagation (financial contagion).

255,pub.1101139893,10.1111/jacf.12259,,,,Statement of the Financial Economists Roundtable: Bank Capital as a Substitute for Prudential Regulation,"The Financial CHOICE Act recently passed by the House proposes to create an “off‐ramp” that would allow banks to escape burdensome prudential regulation if the ratio of their equity capital to their total assets is 10% or more. The Financial Economists Roundtable supports this idea as a means of reducing regulatory costs, but believes some additional safeguards are needed. A capital ratio of 10% may not be high enough to discourage banks from excessive risk taking. A solution is to have two capital requirements for banks choosing the off‐ramp: one absolute (as proposed in the act) and one risk‐based. The FER believes that many banks will prefer this regime to the current burdensome prudential regulation, especially if regulators simplify the setting of risk weights and make them more rule‐based. Regulators setting minimum capital requirements should consider not only a bank’s stand‐alone risk, but also the systemic risk posed by banks, as well as the tendency of accounting measures of income and assets to overstate the economic value of banks’ equity capital. The Financial Choice Act would also eliminate useful elements of ongoing supervision and regulation, not all of which can be addressed by higher capital alone. Furthermore, to facilitate regulatory learning about risks, off‐ramped banks should continue to report the data that regulators use for stress tests, even if they are no longer subjected to the discipline of stress tests. Finally, the act is viewed as too permissive in its treatment of off‐ramped banks that get into trouble. To prevent gaming of regulation, FERC recommends that off‐ramped banks that subsequently fall below the minimum requirements should be required to raise new capital immediately.",,,Journal of Applied Corporate Finance,,Wiley,"1078-1196, 1745-6622",,2017-12,2017,2018-02-20,2017-12,29,4,25-29,Closed,Article,"Calomiris, Charles W.; Harris, Larry; Schrand, Catherine; Weil, Roman L.","Calomiris, Charles W.

274,pub.1102451518,10.2139/ssrn.2724575,,,,Intergenerational Leadership: Coordinating Common Goods and Economic Stability,"Globalization leveraged pressure on contemporary society. Global systemic risks of climate change and overindebtedness in the aftermath of the 2008/09 World Financial Crisis currently raise attention for intergenerational fairness. Pressing social dilemmas beyond the control of singular nation states call for corporate social activities to back governmental regulation in crisis mitigation. The following paper promotes the idea of intergenerational equity in the corporate world as an alternative means to coordinating the common goods and imbuing economic stability beyond a purely governmental approach. The outlined intergenerational equity constraints herald a call for intergenerational equity – the fairness to provide an at least as favorable standard of living as enjoyed today. As an implicit contract and transfer inbetween living and future generations, intergenerational equity avoids discriminating against future generations and ensures future infrastructure, equal opportunities over time and constant access to social welfare for the youth. Intergenerational equity grants a favorable climate between generations and alleviates frictions arising from the negative impacts of intergenerational inequity. Outlining some of the causes of the current intergenerational imbalances regarding climate stability and overindebtedness prepares for recommendations on how to implement intergenerational transfers. The impact of intergenerational transfers on societal well-being is discussed. Future research avenues comprise of investigating situational factors influencing intergenerational leadership in the international arena in order to advance the idea of the private sector aiding on intergenerational imbalances and tackling the most pressing contemporary challenges of mankind.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Puaschunder, Julia M.","Puaschunder, Julia M.

provides vital methods for understanding complex systems. Multilayer networks,
in their multiplex form, have been introduced within the last three years to
analysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have
modelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial
institutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a
non-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising
the same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No
mechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically
evaluated, and no multichannel stabilisation strategies for pre-emptive
contagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an
interconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial
institutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity
within different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial
market. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and
resilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion
mechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost
stabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their
interconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion
progressing through the overall structure. The stabilisation strategies subtly
affect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural
resilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each
institution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate
the new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential
Regulatory Authority of the Bank of England. The capabilities of multichannel
stabilisation are confirmed empirically.",,,arXiv,,,,,2017-01-24,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Serguieva, Antoaneta","Serguieva, Antoaneta ()",,"Serguieva, Antoaneta ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,4.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119312266,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Child maltreatment is widespread but often underestimated. Surprisingly, there is hardly any data on child maltreatment and any associated sociodemographic factors children affected by HIV/AIDS in low-income countries. This study employed cross-sectional, quantitative survey that involved 291 children aged 10-17 years and their caregivers in the Lower Manya Krobo District, Ghana and examined their exposure to and experience of child maltreatment. The results show that at least one form of maltreatment was reported by approximately 90% of the children, and it was significantly higher among orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) as compared with comparison children. Older age, frequent changes in residence, non-schooling and living with many siblings are associated with child maltreatment. The results demonstrate that maltreatment among children affected by HIV/AIDS are not rare, and that the dysfunction family conditions that they find themselves bear systemic risks for maltreatment. It is important that culturally appropriate and evidence-based interventions are implemented to address the maltreatment.",The author expresses his gratitude to the Ghana HIV/AIDS Orphans and Vulnerable Children (GHOVUC) study participants.,The author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.,AIDS Care,,Taylor & Francis,"0954-0121, 1360-0451","Humans; Child; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; HIV Infections; Ghana; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sociodemographic Factors; Child Abuse; Child, Orphaned",2022-04-24,2022,2022-04-24,2023-01-02,35,1,106-113,All OA; Green,Article,"Doku, Paul Narh","Doku, Paul Narh (Department of Mental Health Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana)","Doku, Paul Narh (University of Cape Coast)","Doku, Paul Narh (University of Cape Coast)",University of Cape Coast,grid.413081.f,Cape Coast,,Ghana,,,,,,2,2,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-368841/v1.pdf?c=1631895277000,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147350976,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health; 44 Human Society,Behavioral and Social Science; Child Abuse and Neglect Research; Childhood Injury; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Pediatric; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Violence Research; Youth Violence,,,,,C20 Social Work and Social Policy,,dims

241,pub.1002128715,10.1039/c6ra05942b,,,,Electrospun functionalized polyacrylonitrile–chitosan Bi-layer membranes for water filtration applications,"The demand for clean drinking water is fundamental for human life and it has sparked immense interest in production of highly efficient filtration devices which employ advanced functional nanosized materials such as nanofibers.

                    Water scarcity has become a global systemic risk, prompting the development of more efficient filtration technologies. Recently, increasing attention has been given to low cost membrane materials such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers for water filtration. In this study, electrospun PAN nanofibrous membranes were functionalized with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and coated with a layer of electrospun chitosan (Cs), in order to improve the mechanical properties, and anti-bacterial and water filtration performance of the membranes. Morphological analysis revealed that the PAN/ZnO–Cs membranes featured a structural hierarchy comprising a layer of highly porous nanofibrous PAN membranes and a less fibrous and thinner layer of a Cs coating. Addition of the Cs layer increases the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the membranes. Results acquired from a water permeability test indicated that the bi-layer membranes possessed adequate transport properties for typical membrane applications. Furthermore, the additional Cs layer and ZnO nanoparticles significantly improved the heavy metal ion adsorption performance of the PAN membranes. Moreover, the efficiency of the PAN/ZnO–Cs membrane for bacteria filtration has a log reduction value 2 orders of magnitude higher than PAN membranes, while the efficiency of these membranes for antibacterial action (
                    i.e.
                    in terms of log reduction value) is 6 orders of magnitude higher than PAN membranes. These results indicate the PAN/ZnO–Cs membranes are structurally more stable than PAN membranes, better at bacteria removal during the filtration process and better at self-cleaning (
                    i.e.
                    membrane biofouling resistance) than PAN membranes, signifying the potential of these membranes for water filtration applications.",,,RSC Advances,,Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC),2046-2069,,2016,2016,2016,2016,6,59,53882-53893,All OA; Green,Article,"Makaremi, Maziyar; Lim, Chia Xin; Pasbakhsh, Pooria; Lee, Sui Mae; Goh, Kheng Lim; Chang, Hengky; Chan, Eng Seng","Makaremi, Maziyar (Advanced Engineering Platform, Mechanical Engineering Discipline, School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, 47500 Selangor, Malaysia); Lim, Chia Xin (School of Science, Monash University Malaysia, 47500 Selangor, Malaysia); Pasbakhsh, Pooria (Advanced Engineering Platform, Mechanical Engineering Discipline, School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, 47500 Selangor, Malaysia); Lee, Sui Mae (School of Science, Monash University Malaysia, 47500 Selangor, Malaysia); Goh, Kheng Lim (School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering, Newcastle University, NE1 7RU, UK); Chang, Hengky (Nanotechnology and Materials Science, Biomedical Engineering Group, School of Engineering (Manufacturing), Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore, 569830, Singapore); Chan, Eng Seng (Advanced Engineering Platform, Chemical Engineering Discipline, School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia, 47500 Selangor, Malaysia)",,"Makaremi, Maziyar (Monash University Malaysia); Lim, Chia Xin (Monash University Malaysia); Pasbakhsh, Pooria (Monash University Malaysia); Lee, Sui Mae (Monash University Malaysia); Goh, Kheng Lim (Newcastle University); Chang, Hengky (Nanyang Polytechnic); Chan, Eng Seng (Monash University Malaysia)",Monash University Malaysia; Nanyang Polytechnic; Newcastle University,grid.440425.3; grid.458363.f; grid.1006.7,Subang Jaya; Singapore; Newcastle upon Tyne,; ; ,Malaysia; Singapore; United Kingdom,,,,,,63,38,,,,https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/fulltext.aspx?url=227171/EF513ADB-7C8F-475A-BDF7-EB58BB3D3200.pdf&pub_id=227171,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002128715,34 Chemical Sciences,Bioengineering; Nanotechnology,,,,,B12 Engineering,6 Clean Water and Sanitation,dims

We propose a quantile regression neural network model to capture the non-linear evolution of systemic risk in the European gas and oil markets. We find that the RUC significantly increased systemic risk in both the European gas and the oil markets. The systemic risk is higher, and rises much more quickly and falls much more slowly in the gas market than in the oil market. The dynamics of systemic risk are closely linked to major events during the RUC. The US-dollar-to-ruble exchange rate contributes most to this systemic risk, followed by Europe’s gas stocks and gas imports from Russia. In terms of risk exposure, the gas market is more vulnerable than the oil market. We propose an elasticity coefficient of systemic risk to evaluate its sensitivity to stress scenarios.

As result of the carried out study, three existing approaches were identified: the «Three Lines of Protection» model (2013), the «Three Lines» model (2020), and the «Dynamic Risk Management» model (2020). It is proposed to consider the «Three Lines of Protection» model as a transition from non-systemic risk management in organizations to a structured vision of this process with a clear definition of the responsibilities of key participants. The article explains the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. Its advantages include simplicity and clarity in use in practice. Among the shortcomings of the model are the following: an overly structured approach to risk management in organizations; too cautious attitude to possible risks; dubious versatility of the model; imperfection of its structure. Three directions for possible improvement of the model are defined. It is identified that in 2020 there was an updated approach to risk management in organizations – the «Three Lines» model. A comparison of the «Three Lines of Protection» model with the «Three Lines» model was carried out. The main advantages of the new approach are determined. The emergence of an alternative vision of the process of risk management and control in organizations against the background of new social challenges – the «Dynamic risk management» is researched. The advantages of this approach include its priority areas in risk management in organizations, i.e.: risk management taking into account their consequences, risk management based on actions, risk management with an orientation towards digital technologies. The differences between traditional models and the newest approach are specified. It is determined that each of the three principles of the latest approach improves the quality of risk management in organizations as participants in the survey conducted by Gartner company.

The CAPM model in its analysis uses the link between the systemic risk measure (beta) and the expected market return. Guided by this model, the analysis of monthly returns of selected shares on the Belgrade Stock Exchange in the period from 2011 to 2021 was performed in this research. In the research, the beta coefficient of selected shares was calculated with the help of the covariance of market return and stock return. The results and their statistical value were confirmed by the linear regression test. The rest of the research tests the applicability of the CAPM model to selected actions and in the same way, the SML (security market line) is devised, which is a graphical representation of the model.

In a dual banking system, both conventional and Islamic financial institutions operate side by side, but specific laws and regulations have been introduced for the Islamic financial institutions. Based on the analysis there is no “one size fits all”; different models might be effective depending on the country specifics. The choice among the different macroprudential models is mostly influenced by traditions, current institutional frameworks for other policies and political economy considerations. Furthermore, there is no differentiation of macroprudential policy framework between conventional and Islamic financial institutions that has been practiced by the authorities with dual banking system. The reason is to avoid regulatory arbitrage between these two financial institutions and the fact that Islamic financial institution is still largely based on mark-up or profit margin techniques in its operation.",,,,Macroprudential Regulation and Policy for the Islamic Financial Industry,Springer Nature,,,2016-05-26,2016,2016-05-26,2016,,,3-24,Closed,Chapter,"Zulkhibri, Muhamed; Naiya, Ismaeel","Zulkhibri, Muhamed (Islamic Research and Training Institute, Islamic Development Bank, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia); Naiya, Ismaeel (Economic Research and Policy Department, Islamic Development Bank, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)","Zulkhibri, Muhamed (Islamic Development Bank)","Zulkhibri, Muhamed (Islamic Development Bank); Naiya, Ismaeel (Islamic Development Bank)",Islamic Development Bank,grid.468042.c,Jeddah,,Saudi Arabia,,,,,,2,0,,1.48,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011814206,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4801 Commercial Law",Behavioral and Social Science,,"8.3 Policy, ethics, and research governance",,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

A theoretical model was built to analyse the relationship between the assets and liabilities of peer-to-peer platforms and the risk of the entire online lending industry. The conditional value at risk method was used to measure the risk spillover effect of the online lending industry and the different types of platforms. Index smoothing and moving average were used to examine risk contagion. When the risk rate of the portfolio of the platform generally increases, the systemic risk of the whole industry also increases, and if the systemic risk of the industry spreads to the portfolio of the platform, it could affect the stability of the capital flow of the platform, and then affect the risk expectation of the platform itself. Most platforms with risk concerns were private. Banking platforms and public platforms were greatly affected by market risk; however, their own risks had relatively little impact on the overall market. The greater the market risk, the more platforms become risk platforms, and the smaller the impact on transition platforms.

We evaluate in a hazard-modeling framework the statistical and economic significance of variables that have been suggested by prior theoretical and empirical studies to be antecedents of banking crises, such as: measures of real estate price exuberance, asset returns and the growth of leverage. In quantifying the exposure of the banking system to real estate pricing, we identify dynamics consistent with ‘boom-bust cycles’ or bubble-like behaviour in the housing market.

The corrosive effects of private insurance on public life,"Contemporary societies are not only ""risk societies"", but also insurance societies. While the shift of systemic risks from the community to the individual is a distinctive trait of modernity, research on the consequences of this process has focused almost exclusively on welfare state responses aimed at re-collectivizing societal risks. Individual-level reactions associated with the need for a private safety net against the uncertainty brought by risk societies have been largely overlooked. What happens to a society and its individuals when private insurance becomes commonplace? Focusing on Germany, we use the data of the German Socio-Economic Panel (1984-2018) to investigate the attitudinal antecedents and consequences of contracting private insurance. As one of the most important sources of private welfare, life insurance attracts risk-averse individuals who are highly concerned with public economic affairs and see the market-based solutions of conservative parties as the best way to safeguard their economic security. While short-term attitudinal effects are absent, a longitudinal approach reveals that becoming insured gradually increases economic security but also entails withdrawal from public life and aversion to parties that support social redistribution. The loss of dynamism of a society may thus be related not only to public welfare but also to a private institution at the heart of the financial markets, which moreover has privatizing, welfare-eroding effects. The paper argues for a more general sociology of insurance.",We thank the editor Prof. Nigel Dodd for his clear‐headed guidance throughout the peer review process as well as the two anonymous reviewers and participants of the Free University of Berlin Sociology Colloquium for helpful comments.

In this paper we propose to enrich the topological perspective of network models with a more structured statistical framework, that of Bayesian graphical Gaussian models. From a statistical viewpoint, we propose a new class of hierarchical Bayesian graphical models, that can split correlations between institutions into country specific and idiosyncratic ones, in a way that parallels the decomposition of returns in the well-known Capital Asset Pricing Model. From a financial economics viewpoint, we suggest a way to model systemic risk that can explicitly take into account frictions between different financial markets, particularly suited to study the on-going banking union process in Europe.

We find that for the EU26 during the period 1995–2008, excessive household leverage through mortgage lending exerted a “crowding-out” effect on availability of credit to support innovation and productive investment. The crowding out effect ultimately translated into a GDP growth that was decoupled from real household income. In this article we explain that shifting credit towards mortgages and away from corporate projects is consistent with rational behaviour based on historical trends aimed at minimizing short-term risk for each individual bank. Nevertheless, as a whole, the sum of individual risk-reducing attitudes generated a long-term systemic risk.","We would like to thank attendees of the “Finance and Economic Growth in the Aftermath of the Crisis” conference (Milan, 11–13 September 2017) for their helpful feedback.

The model simulates the balance sheets of insurance firms, who collect premiums from clients in return for insuring them against intermittent, heavy-tailed risks. Firms manage their capital and pay dividends to their investors and use either reinsurance contracts or cat bonds to hedge their tail risk. The model generates plausible time series of profits and losses and recovers stylized facts, such as the insurance cycle and the emergence of asymmetric firm size distributions. We use the model to investigate the problem of risk model homogeneity. Under the European regulatory framework Solvency II, insurance companies are required to use only certified risk models. This has led to a situation in which only a few firms provide risk models, creating a systemic fragility to the errors in these models. We demonstrate that using too few models increases the risk of nonpayment and default while lowering profits for the industry as a whole. The presence of the reinsurance industry ameliorates the problem but does not remove it. Our results suggest that it would be valuable for regulators to incentivize model diversity. The framework we develop here provides a first step toward a simulation model of the insurance industry, which could be used to test policies and strategies for capital management.","This work has been supported by MS Amlin as part of the project “Systemic Risk of Modelling.” We acknowledge enlightening discussions with JB Crozet, Trevor Maynard, and David Singh.

A drug holiday from bisphosphonates before tooth extraction may not be necessary.IntroductionIt is controversial whether bisphosphonate withdrawal is necessary prior to invasive procedures such as tooth extraction in order to prevent bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical safety of continuing oral bisphosphonate therapy in patients undergoing tooth extraction.MethodsWe prospectively enrolled 132 patients (20 men, 112 women) who were receiving oral bisphosphonates for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis and required tooth extraction. All patients were managed using an identical protocol, which included preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and did not necessarily require complete wound closure. The patients were classified into groups according to the duration of bisphosphonate administration: < 2 years (n = 51), 2–5 years (n = 41), 5–10 years (n = 28), and > 10 years (n = 12). The groups were compared regarding the time taken for the extraction socket to heal, and the occurrence of BRONJ. Follow-up duration was at least 3 months.ResultsA total of 274 teeth were removed. Long-term oral bisphosphonate therapy for > 5 years significantly delayed the healing of the extraction socket in comparison with administration for < 5 years; however, BRONJ did not develop in any group. There was no prolongation of wound healing due to systemic risk factors such as glucocorticoid administration and diabetes mellitus. There were no adverse skeletal events such as bone fracture.ConclusionsPatients who underwent tooth extraction with continued oral bisphosphonate therapy showed delayed healing of the extraction socket as the cumulative administration period prolonged, but BRONJ did not develop.","We thank Kelly Zammit, BVSc, from Edanz Group (www.edanzediting.com/ac), for editing a draft of this manuscript.",,Osteoporosis International,,Springer Nature,"0937-941X, 1433-2965","Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tooth Extraction; Wound Healing",2018-07-02,2018,2018-07-02,2018-10,29,10,2315-2321,Closed,Article,"Shudo, A.; Kishimoto, H.; Takaoka, K.; Noguchi, K.","Shudo, A.

Motivated by inconsistent theoretical evaluations on the impact of bank concentration on the likelihood of a systemic banking crisis, this paper investigates the role of bank concentration on financial stability in Kenya with competition as an intervening variable. The novelity of this study lies on the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) in the analysis of direct and indirect effects of bank concentration on financial stability. Results show that higher concentration induces banks to increase cost of service provision which may aggravate credit risks and expose banks to systemic risks. Further, competition plays a significant role in ensuring financial system stability which supports the ‘competition-stabiliy’ hypothesis. Uncompetitive banking industry may therefore provide incentive for banks to take excessive risks, which renders them vulnerable to systematic risks. We also establish that tight regulations enhances concentration and financial stability but hinders competition. These new insights give bank regulators and policy makers an incentive to formulate and implement the right policies to improve financial stability.",,,International Journal of Economics and Finance,,Canadian Center of Science and Education,"1916-971X, 1916-9728",,2021-05-18,2021,2021-05-18,,13,6,103,All OA; Gold,Article,"Antony, Atellu; Peter, Muriu; Odhiambo, Sule","Antony, Atellu (); Peter, Muriu (); Odhiambo, Sule ()",,"Antony, Atellu (); Peter, Muriu (); Odhiambo, Sule ()",,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,1.98,,https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijef/article/download/0/0/45318/48069,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138323440,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Methods:  Retrospective study. From December 2013 to June 2020, 16 patients diagnosed with Moraxella keratitis in the Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University were recruited. The clinical characteristics, risk factors, treatment effect, distribution of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance were analyzed in this study. The drug resistance trend was analyzed, and the Moraxella species were identified with the semi-automatic identification instrument ATB Reader and the mass spectrometer MBT.   Results:  The 16 cases of Moraxella keratitis studied were all confirmed cases after laboratory examination. According to the analysis of clinical characteristics, previous eye surgery and diabetes/hypertension were the most common local and systemic risk factors. The most common presenting complaint of patients was eye pain, and the most common examination result was corneal ulcer. Laboratory examination revealed that there were 7 cases of Moraxella lacunarum, 4 cases of Moraxella nonliquifaciens, 3 cases of Moraxella osloensis, 1 case of Moraxella catarrhalis, 1 case of Moraxella atalantae. The drug sensitivity test showed that the pathogenic bacteria isolated were rarely resistant to penicillin, cephalosporin, tetracycline, quinolones, aminoglycosides, etc.   Conclusions:  In this study of 16 cases of Moraxella keratitis patients, eye pain and corneal ulcers are the most common. The comparative analysis of different Moraxella bacteria suggests that in Moraxella keratitis cases, Moraxella lacunar and Moraxella nonliquefied are the two main infectious pathogens, and their isolates are highly sensitive to drugs.",,,Journal of Optometry and Ophthalmology,,,1674-845X,,2021-08-25,2021,,2021-08-25,23,08,597-603,Closed,Article,"Yuanyuan, Yang; Haiou, Wang; Pengfei, Chen; Yali, Li; Meiqin, Zheng","Yuanyuan, Yang (Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China); Haiou, Wang (Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China); Pengfei, Chen (Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China); Yali, Li (Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China); Meiqin, Zheng (Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 325027, China)","Meiqin, Zheng (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College)","Yuanyuan, Yang (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College); Haiou, Wang (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College); Pengfei, Chen (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College); Yali, Li (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College); Meiqin, Zheng (Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College)",Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College,grid.414701.7,Wenzhou,,China,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142350267,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry,Antimicrobial Resistance; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Patient Safety; Prevention,,,,,A01 Clinical Medicine,,dims

A key challenge is the absence of metrics that relate physical risk to financial risk, either at the company or at the portfolio level, resulting in the lack of asset risk pricing. Our research tests the hypothesis that water risk impacts revenue and the cost of doing business and, by inference stock volatility, unless the company manages its risk appropriately. We related stock volatility metrics and water risk exposures of four electric utilities during a two-year period (2007-2008) that captured multiple drought events, commodity (coal) price fluctuations, and systemic risk in the financial markets. Using waterBeta and waterVaR metrics, the impact of water risk on stock volatility (VaR) was highly dependent on the value chain position of the firm, the capital efficiency of water, and stock elasticity. WaterVaR values range from $5M for the Southern Company to $167M for AES.

This question has salience in the context that while bank bailouts solve an immediate problem of systemic risk, they create another set of problems almost as significant. Bailouts involve largescale socialization of private losses, are politically toxic, ideologically contrary to market norms, and economically costly to the state. For these reasons many commentators view the policy to be neither optimal nor desirable, yet it has nonetheless been institutionalized in all modern financial systems. In this paper I argue that the global diffusion of bank bailout policy over the past two centuries is an example of institutional evolution. A process of variation, selection and retention has winnowed down initial variation in responses to possible financial sector collapse to one policy, a state-backed guarantee to bail out the financial system. Understanding the past is a prerequisite for gaining insight into possible futures. Consequently, historical study of bank bailouts will contribute to understanding the future evolution of systemic banking crises by providing insight into the evolution of institutional resilience.","The author thanks two anonymous reviewers as well as Campbell Jones and Steve Matthewman for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

264,pub.1102321619,10.2139/ssrn.1914461,,,,Regulation of Banking and Financial Markets,"This paper is one chapter of the volume “Regulation and Economics” of the second edition of the Encyclopedia of Law and Economics. The authors review the economics of banking and financial markets and the regulatory response to market failure. Market failure in finance depends on problems of information and externalities. Regulation addresses these problems through conduct of business rules and prudential requirements. This approach has recently proved insufficient to prevent financial crises. Governments and central banks had to step in with massive safety nets in order to prevent financial meltdown. Although the appropriate regulatory response to the global financial crisis is still to be discovered, this chapter tries to draw a few lessons for financial regulation and supervision. First, prudential regulation and supervision should monitor, and possibly limit, competition between banks and non-banks in order to identify timely new sources of systemic risk. Second, financial stability policies need to strike a difficult balance between ex-ante strictness and ex-post leniency in order to deal with non-quantifiable risks. Moral hazard is not the only determinants of systemic instability; knightian uncertainty also determines instability by suddenly curtailing market and funding liquidity. Third, all financial institutions falling within the regulatory perimeter should have good corporate governance. However, what is good governance for non-financial firms is not necessarily efficient for financial firms due to the quality and quantity of externalities involved. Finally, because systemic externalities are cross-jurisdictional in modern financial markets, at least coordination among monetary and supervisory authorities of different countries is warranted.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2011,2011,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Pacces, Alessio M.; Heremans, Dirk","Pacces, Alessio M.

First is based on the estimate on value at risk conditional allowing to measure the systemic importance of each banking institution. In addition, the second approach uses the heteroscedasticity models in order to consider the conditional correlations, making it possible, to measure the dependence between the Moroccan banks and with the whole of the financial system. The results obtained with through these two approaches confirm that ATW, BMCI and the BMCE are the most systemic banks in Moroccan banking system and who can initiate a systemic crisis.

Glycoxidation plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis, as pentosidine and Nε- carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), were detected in AD hallmarks, and in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the definitive role of AGEs in the neuropathology of AD is inconclusive. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the level of pentosidine in CSF of patients affected by neurological disorders, including probable AD, in order to assess the feasibility of AGEs detection in CSF and to explore pentosidine as a potential biomarker in AD.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with AD (NINCDS ADRDA criteria) and different neurological disorders were enrolled. Diabetic patients were excluded. Pentosidine, CML, amyloid β1-42 were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Odetti modified method,and by sandwich ELISA respectively.
RESULTS: Our data showed the presence of pentosidine in all CSF samples, a significant increase in CSF pentosidine levels with age (p<0.05) and a significant decreased concentration of pentosidine in four AD subjects (p<0.01), after normalization to CSF protein concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that AGEs concentration in CSF might benefit from age correction, at least for pentosidine, originally addressing a potential systemic age-dependent AGEs accumulation. The significant decrease of CSF pentosidine in AD, even in 4 patients, might conceive that different AGEs inform specific types of neurodegeneration, depending on oxidative stress levels, blood - brain barrier permeability, brain localization and systemic risk factors.",,,Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine,,De Gruyter,"1434-6621, 1437-4331","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Arginine; Biomarkers; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Lysine; Male; Middle Aged; Peptide Fragments",2013-04-06,2013,2013-04-06,2014-01-01,52,1,117-120,Closed,Article,"Monacelli, Fiammetta; Borghi, Roberta; Pacini, Davide; Serrati, Carlo; Traverso, Nicola; Odetti, Patrizio","Monacelli, Fiammetta (DIMI, Section of Geriatrics and Gerontology, University-Hospital IRRCS-IST San Martino, Genoa, Italy); Borghi, Roberta (DIMI, Section of Geriatrics and Gerontology, University-Hospital IRRCS-IST San Martino, Genoa, Italy); Pacini, Davide (DIMI, Section of Geriatrics and Gerontology, University-Hospital IRRCS-IST San Martino, Genoa, Italy); Serrati, Carlo (Neurology Unit, S.

The goal of our study is to investigate how these two channels of risk interact to propagate individual defaults to a system-wide catastrophe. We formulate the model as an optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and derive a partition algorithm to solve for the market-clearing equilibrium. The solutions so obtained enables us to identify two factors, the network multiplier and the liquidity amplifier, to characterize the contributions of these two channels to financial systemic risk, whereby we can acquire better understanding of the effectiveness of several policy interventions. The analysis behind the algorithm yields estimates for the contagion probability on the basis of the market value of the institutions' net worths, underscoring the importance of equity capital as a cushion against systemic shocks in the presence of the liquidity channel. The optimization formulation also provides more structural insights to allow us to extend the study of systemic risk to a system with debts of different seniorities, and meanwhile presents a close connection to the literature of stochastic networks. Finally, we illustrate the impacts of the network and the liquidity channels -- in particular, the significance of the latter -- in the formation of systemic risk with data on the European banking system.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Chen, Nan; Liu, Xin; Yao, David","Chen, Nan (The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)); Liu, Xin (The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) - Department of Systems Engineering & Engineering Management); Yao, David (Columbia University)",,"Chen, Nan (Chinese University of Hong Kong); Liu, Xin (); Yao, David (Columbia University)",Columbia University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,grid.21729.3f; grid.10784.3a,New York; Hong Kong,New York; ,United States; China,,,,,,3,0,,1.09,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102410532,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

As a results, new private fund regime has been promulgated around the glove. It is a regulatory paradigm shift because private fund has been left unregulated area in the past. On the other hand, Korean private fund regime has been changed in the direction for the government to intervene the private fund market as little as possible from a heavily regulated one. Investor protection or lack of transparency, and/or prevention of systemic risk have been pointed out as primary rationales for private fund regulation. Investor protection concern should not be a critical one because it could be handled without much difficulty by limiting general public’s direct access to the private market. Also systemic risk concern may be mitigated by regulating the private fund manager, not regulating the private fund itself, because private fund manager is the very person to deal with the fund daily activities with full discretion. In sum, future private fund regime should be something to make private fund market more private and visible hand’s direct intervention should be refrained as much as possible.

The proposed model makes use of the network structure of financial institutions by including the stock return series of all listed banks in the financial system. Furthermore, a wide set of common risk factors (macroeconomic risk factors, sovereign risk, financial risk and housing price risk) is included to allow these factors to affect the banks. The model uses Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) of Locally Weighted Regression models (LOESS), i.e. BMA-LOESS. The network structure of the financial sector is analysed by computing measures of network centrality (degree, closeness and betweenness) and it is shown that this information can be used to provide measures of the systemic importance of institutions. Using data from 2005 (2nd quarter) to 2013 (3rd quarter), this paper provides further insight into the time-varying importance of risk factors and it is shown that the model produces superior conditional out-of-sample forecasts (i.e. projections) than a classical linear Bayesian multi-factor model.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2015,2015,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"De Bruyckere, Valerie","De Bruyckere, Valerie (Ghent University - Department of Financial Economics)",,"De Bruyckere, Valerie (Ghent University)",Ghent University,grid.5342.0,Ghent,,Belgium,,,,,,2,1,,0.81,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/154281/1/ecbwp1848.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142674923,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

By holding correlated asset portfolios and serving as counterparties to similarly situated financial institutions, managers can strategically increase the likelihood of a government bailout rather than receivership under the OLA. Three case studies — Lehman Brothers, AIG, and large European banks’ response to the 2011 bail-in proposals — demonstrate the implications of the OLA’s shortcomings and the inadequacy of the FDIC’s approach.

This was against the backdrop that the 2012 banking reform was a major regulatory intervention that mainstreamed ERM in the Nigerian banking sector.   Design/methodology/approach  The study employed a mixed methodology of content, trend and quantitative analyses. Ex post facto research design was deployed to analyse performance differential of banks, with respect to the implementation of ERM, over a 10-year period (2008–2017). A disclosure checklist developed from the COSO ERM integrated framework was used to assess the robustness of ERM by content-analysing divulgence on risk management in published annual reports. The banking reform periods were dichotomised into pre- (2008–2012) and post- (2013–2017) reform periods. Jonckheere–Terpstra test, independent sample t -test and Mann–Whitney test were applied to analyse a total of 1,036 firm-year observations over the period 2008–2017.    Findings Result shows that bank attributes significantly affecting the robustness of risk management practice are level of capitalisation, scope of operation, systemic importance and size. Performance of banks improved slightly during the post-2012 banking reform period. This suggests that as banks consolidate on the gains of ERM, benefits of the regulatory policy on risk management may be realised in the long run. Result also shows that ERM enhances long-term performance, connoting that effective risk management could serve as a competitive strategy for surviving turbulence that typically characterises the banking sector.   Practical implications The emergence of level of capitalisation, scope of operation, systemic importance and size as determinants of ERM provides empirical evidence to support the practice of reviewing the capital requirements for banking business from time to time by regulatory authorities (i.e. recapitalisation policy) as a strategy for managing systemic risk. Top management of banks may consider instituting mechanisms that will ensure risk management is given prominence. A proactive approach must be taken to convert risks to opportunities by banks and other financial institutions, going forward, to cope with the vicissitudes of financial intermediation.   Originality/value The originality of the study stems from the consideration that it provides some new insights into the impact of ERM on banks long-term sustainability in a developing country. The study also contributes to knowledge by exposing the factors determining the robustness of risk management practice. The study developed a checklist for assessing ERM practice from annual reports and other risk management disclosure documents.

It is not clear whether or how banks’ behaviors will change in this new joint-constraint regime. To gain some insight, we study the balance sheet liquidity behavior of U.S. banking companies in response to negative equity capital shocks prior to the implementation of Basel III. Our 1998-2012 data indicate that banks treated regulatory capital and balance sheet liquidity (e.g., net stable funding ratios, core deposits-to-loans, liquid assets-to-assets) as substitutes rather than complements. This main finding is limited to so-called ‘community banks’ with assets less than $1 billion; equity capital and liquidity were neither substitutes nor complements at larger banks. In the course of rebuilding their capital ratios, shocked community banks substituted away from loans and loan commitments and reduced their dividend payouts, actions that resulted in greater balance sheet liquidity. Thus, in the state of nature that has traditionally most concerned bank regulators (i.e., stress to bank equity capital), community banks increase their liquidity buffers. Given that these lenders do not pose systemic risk, and that they have historically exceeded the Basel III liquidity minimums by wide margins, our findings suggest that imposing minimum liquidity thresholds on small banks will likely yield little prudential benefit.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2017,2017,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"DeYoung, Robert; Distinguin, Isabelle; Tarazi, Amine","DeYoung, Robert (University of Kansas School of Business); Distinguin, Isabelle (Université de Limoges, LAPE); Tarazi, Amine (University of Limoges - Faculty of Law and Economic Science)",,"DeYoung, Robert (University of Kansas); Distinguin, Isabelle (University of Limoges); Tarazi, Amine (University of Limoges)",University of Limoges; University of Kansas,grid.9966.0; grid.266515.3,Limoges; Lawrence,; Kansas,France; United States,,,,,,1,1,,0.43,,https://hal-unilim.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01559053/file/DeYoung%20Distinguin%20Tarazi_June%2015LONGABSTRACT.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091029724,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Currently, there is a lack of consensus among experts on the nature of these associations and confusion among health care providers and the public on how to interpret this rapidly growing body of science. This article overviews the current evidence linking periodontal diseases to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, preterm low birth weight babies, respiratory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was taken from systematic reviews, clinical trials, and mechanistic studies retrieved in searches of the PubMed electronic database. The available data provide the basis for applied practical clinical recommendations.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence is summarized and critically reviewed from systematic reviews, primary clinical trials, and mechanistic studies
CONCLUSIONS: Surrogate markers for chronic periodontitis, such as tooth loss, show relatively consistent but weak associations with multiple systemic conditions. Despite biological plausibility, shorter-term interventional trials have generally not supported unambiguous cause-and-effect relationships. Nevertheless, the effective treatment of periodontal infections is important to achieve oral health goals, as well as to reduce the systemic risks of chronic local inflammation and bacteremias. Inflammatory periodontal diseases exhibit an association with multiple systemic conditions. With pregnancy as a possible exception, the local and systemic effects of periodontal infections and inflammation are usually exerted for many years, typically among those who are middle-aged or older. It follows that numerous epidemiological associations linking chronic periodontitis to age-associated and biologically complex conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, respiratory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers, erectile dysfunction, kidney disease and dementia, have been reported. In the coming years, it seems likely that additional associations will be reported, despite adjustments for known genetic, behavioral and environmental confounders. Determining cause-and-effect mechanisms is more complicated, especially in circumstances where systemic effects may be subtle. Currently, however, there is a lack of consensus among experts on the nature of these associations and confusion among health care providers and the public on how to interpret this rapidly growing body of science.

The currently preferred policy option is the regulation of capital requirements, with the main focus on combating procyclicality and on identifying the banks that have a high systemic importance, those that are ""too big to fail"". Here we argue that the concept of systemic risk should include the analysis of the system as a whole and we explore systematically the most important properties for policy purposes of networks topology on resistance to shocks. In a thorough study going from analytical models to empirical data, we show two sharp transitions from safe to risky regimes: 1) diversification becomes harmful with just a small fraction (~2%) of the shocks sampled from a fat tailed shock distributions and 2) when large shocks are present a critical link density exists where an effective giant cluster forms and most firms become vulnerable. This threshold depends on the network topology, especially on modularity. Firm size heterogeneity has important but diverse effects that are heavily dependent on shock characteristics. Similarly, degree heterogeneity increases vulnerability only when shocks are directed at the most connected firms. Furthermore, by studying the structure of the core of the transnational corporation network from real data, we show that its stability could be clearly increased by removing some of the links with highest centrality betweenness. Our results provide a novel insight and arguments for policy makers to focus surveillance on the connections between firms, in addition to capital requirements directed at the nodes.","This project was founded by ERA-Net on Complexity through grant RESINEE (http://www.complexitynet.eu/Pages/default.aspx), by MINECO (Spain, http://www.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/mineco/) through grant PRODIEVO and by Comunidad de Madrid through grant MODELICO-CM (http://modelico.es/index.php/es/).

213,pub.1016017034,10.1002/sys.21303,,,,Assessing Systemic Risk to Cloud‐Computing Technology as Complex Interconnected Systems of Systems,"This paper presents a methodology for modeling cloud‐computing technology (CCT), its users, and, most important, would‐be malicious intruders as complex interdependent and interconnected systems of systems (S‐o‐S). The paper posits and demonstrates that due to the inherent structure of CCT as S‐o‐S, users of public CCT are at a higher risk of unlawful intrusion than users of non‐CCT systems. At the same time, the flexibility and the agility of CCT S‐o‐S provide advantages relative to most non‐CCT S‐o‐S. The need is for the CCT community to employ these advantages as an integral part of its cyber security strategy. Our analysis builds on the following theory and methodology: we consider CCT and its users as complex interconnected hardware and software subsystems that interact as S‐o‐S through shared states, resources, and subsystems, which are connected in series (rather than in parallel, as is the case for most non‐CCT systems); exploiting the serial connectivity of CCT S‐o‐S, we use fault‐tree analysis to demonstrate the resulting unreliability of CCT S‐o‐S; building on the published literature, we incorporate Pareto‐optimal frontiers to compare the risks faced by security‐conscious users of CCT (e.g., large corporations) versus those faced by cost‐conscious users (e.g., small or startup companies); and we show that users of CCT as S‐o‐S are at a higher risk than users of non‐CCT systems for certain assumptions and types of cyber attacks. The paper is structured as follows: Part A outlines the characteristics of CCT S‐o‐S, addresses the inherent vulnerability of CCT S‐o‐S to cyber intrusion and attack, and provides a brief literature review; Part B offers a rationale for modeling CCT as interconnected and interdependent S‐o‐S; Part C demonstrates, through the use of fault‐tree analysis, the higher risk faced by CCT and its users as complex S‐o‐S; Part D presents an economic analysis of the security of CCT as S‐o‐S; and Part E offers conclusions and lessons learned.","The research presented in this paper was supported by the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection (I3P) through a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS); from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Award 0928550‐Adaptive Systems‐Based Prioritization of Bridge Infrastructure Maintenance: Integrated Modeling of Technical, Socio‐Economic, and Normative Dimensions; and from the University of Virginia funds in support of the Phantom Systems Models Laboratory (PSML) at the Center for Risk Management of Engineering Systems.

By combining customer transactions and credit bureau data from January 2005 to April 2009 for a sample of a major commercial bank’s customers, we are able to construct out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R2’s of forecasted/realized delinquencies of 85%. Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses.

In this paper, a risk correlation network is constructed among Chinese banks employing the maximum entropy method, which simulates the individual risks of banks in the presence of exogenous shocks, the contagious risks, and total systemic risk through the effect of network spillovers, and analyzes its influencing factors. The results show that there is an increasingly rising trend in the overall systemic risk of China’s banking industry, and that the value of systemic risk is relatively large. From the perspective of the composition of banking systemic risk, individual risk accounts for a large proportion, about 70%, which is the main source of banking systemic risk, among which China’s state-owned commercial banks are the largest source. The contagious risk of banks accounts for about 30%. Furthermore, the contagious risk contribution of various banks is basically negatively correlated with their scale. The smallest urban commercial bank in the banking industry contributes at least 50% of the contagion risk, while the state-owned commercial bank, which accounts for about 40% of the total assets of the banking industry, only contributes less than 30% of the contagion risk.",,,Systems,,MDPI,2079-8954,,2022-02-08,2022,2022-02-08,,10,1,14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zou, Jin; Fu, Xu; Yang, Jun; Gong, Chi","Zou, Jin (); Fu, Xu (); Yang, Jun (); Gong, Chi ()",,"Zou, Jin (); Fu, Xu (); Yang, Jun (); Gong, Chi ()",,,,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/10/1/14/pdf?version=1644890104,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145421133,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This approach of cumulating requirements bears the risk of individual measures negating or even conflicting with each other which might lessen their desired effects on financial stability. We provide an analysis of the impact of Basel III’s main components on financial stability in a stock-flow consistent agent-based computational economic model. We find that the positive joint impact of the microprudential instruments is considerably larger than the sum of the individual contributions to stability, i.e. the standalone impacts are non-additive. However, except for the buffers, the macroprudential overlay’s impact is either marginal or even destabilizing. Despite its simplicity, the leverage ratio performs poorly, especially when associated drawbacks are explicitly taken into account. Surcharges on SIBs seem to rather contribute to financial regulations complexity than to the resilience of the system.","We would like to thank Dirk Bezemer, Alan Kirman, Michael Roos, Paul Ormerod, David Colander, Giorgio Fagioli, Thomas Lux, Joanna Bryson, Sander van der Hoog, Andrea Roventini, Peter Sarlin, Sven Offick, Ulrich Stolzenburg, Benjamin Burghardt, Stephen Sacht, Falko Schlaffke, the participants of the International Conference on Interlinkages and Systemic Risk (Ancona, Italy; July 2013), and the First Bordeaux Workshop on Agent-based Macroeconomics (Bordeaux, France; November 2013) as well as four anonymous referees for a lot of fruitful comments.",,Quantitative Finance,,Taylor & Francis,"1469-7688, 1469-7696",,2015-03-13,2015,2015-03-13,2015-12-02,15,12,1917-1932,All OA; Green,Article,"Krug, Sebastian; Lengnick, Matthias; Wohltmann, Hans-Werner","Krug, Sebastian (Department of Economics, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany, .); Lengnick, Matthias (Department of Economics, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany, .); Wohltmann, Hans-Werner (Department of Economics, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany, .)","Krug, Sebastian (Kiel University)","Krug, Sebastian (Kiel University); Lengnick, Matthias (Kiel University); Wohltmann, Hans-Werner (Kiel University)",Kiel University,grid.9764.c,Kiel,,Germany,,,,,,45,16,,18.32,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/104966/1/812621654.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050028077,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

However, the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can control C5aR activation by generating C5a through its own C5 convertase-like enzymatic activity. In this paper, we show that P. gingivalis uses this mechanism to proactively and selectively inhibit TLR2-induced IL-12p70, whereas the same pathogen-instigated C5aR-TLR2 crosstalk upregulates other inflammatory and bone-resorptive cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). In vivo, the ability of P. gingivalis to manipulate TLR2 activation via the C5a-C5aR axis allowed it to escape IL-12p70-dependent immune clearance and to cause inflammatory bone loss in a murine model of experimental periodontitis. In the latter regard, C5aR-deficient or TLR2-deficient mice were both resistant to periodontal bone loss, in stark contrast with wild-type control mice, which is consistent with the interdependent interactions of C5aR and TLR2 in P. gingivalis immune evasion and induction of bone-resorptive cytokines. In conclusion, P. gingivalis targets C5aR to promote its adaptive fitness and cause periodontal disease. Given the current availability of safe and effective C5aR antagonists, pharmacological blockade of C5aR could act therapeutically in human periodontitis and reduce associated systemic risks.",Disclosures G.H. and J.D.L. have a joint patent pending.

Instead of waiting for international markets for its currency to evolve organically, the Chinese government has undertaken a quasi-mercantilist strategy designed to promote the currency and its own national RMB-based infrastructure. This strategy has emphasized tightly managed capital account deregulation over prudential reforms and robust market supervision, and incentivizes foreign jurisdictions to compete for RMB-based transactions. China’s monetary strategy introduces novel systemic risks to the global financial system, including a potentially inadequate provision of renminbi liquidity, a regulatory race to the bottom between offshore RMB-hubs, and significant transmission belts of financial risk to even non-renminbi markets.

Nevertheless, very few of these approaches address systemic risks, particularly in multi-hazard environments, and thus do not holistically contribute to decision making in various contexts. This paper addresses this gap by means of a critical review and an assessment of approaches to climate and disaster resilience measurement with a particular focus on three issues: (1) the consideration of compounding socioeconomic and climatic risks in approaches to resilience measurement; (2) the methodological and technical aspects of resilience measurement; and (3) the application and practicability of resilience measurement across various contexts to reliably inform decision-making processes. Seventeen key resilience measurement approaches developed by researchers, government, and private and civil society organizations are selected and evaluated according to a set of assessment criteria. Based on this assessment, we conclude with three key findings. First, we find a lack of clear standards and validated approaches in the measurement methodologies, which can lead to inconsistencies and poor data comparability. Second, approaches to resilience measurement should further strive to combine both process- and outcome-based methodological perspectives to represent resilience in the most holistic and standardized manner possible. Third, in the context of multiple hazards, decision-making strategies should address multiple vulnerabilities. To conclude, we suggest that future developments in resilience measurement should allow for the analysis of interactions between multiple stressors across different scales and among systemic risks. Moreover, more rigorous process-based approaches to resilience measurement are still required that can incorporate outputs into decision making.","The authors like to thank for the valuable comments in an earlier version of this document Adriana Keating, Reinhard Mechler, Swenja Surminski, Emilie Etienne, Colin McQuistan, Ann Vaughan, Francisco Ianni and Michael Szönyi.

The analysis is based on case reports and plans, on literature studies and on conceptual models of risks and risk management. Flood risks in the Northern European study area are aggravated by melt- and storm-water runoff, ice jams and coastal flooding. Flood risk assessment is linked with management plans based on EU directives as applied in the case area. National risk management policies and procedures of increasing scope and depth have been devised for climate change, water resources and overall safety, but an integrated approach to health risks is still largely missing. The same is true of surveys of perceived flood risks, and participatory deliberation and collaborative planning procedures for flood risk management in the case area, specifically for adaptive lake regulation. Health impacts, risks and benefits, socio-economic and systemic risks, and over-arching prevention, adaptation and compensation measures are not fully included. We propose a systematic framework for these extensions. Particular attention needs to be given to health risks due to flooding, e.g. from water contamination, moist buildings, mental stress and infrastructure damage and also from management actions. Uncertainties and ambiguities about risks present continuing challenges. It is concluded that health aspects of flooding are complex and need to be better included in assessment and control, to develop more integrated and adaptive systemic risk governance.","Open access funding provided by Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE).

Instead, most approaches within these literatures follow what I call a “continuationist” bias, which assumes that past trends of economic growth and inter-capitalist competition will continue indefinitely into the future. I identify three key reasons for this assumption: 1) a lack of engagement with evidence that meeting the Paris Agreement targets is incompatible with continuous economic growth; 2) an underestimation of the possibility that failure to meet these targets will unleash irreversible tipping points in the earth system, and 3) limited consideration of the ways climate change will converge with economic stagnation, financial instability, and food system vulnerabilities to intensify systemic risks to the global economy in the near-term and especially later this century. I argue that IR scholars should therefore explore the potential for ‘post-growth’ world orders to stabilize the climate system, consider how world order may adapt to a three or four degree world if Paris Agreement targets are exceeded, and investigate the possible dynamics of global ‘collapse’ in case runaway climate change overwhelms collective adaptation capacities during this century.",,,Cambridge Review of International Affairs,,Taylor & Francis,"0955-7571, 1474-449X",,2020-10-12,2020,2020-10-12,2022-11-02,35,6,868-887,All OA; Green,Article,"Albert, Michael J.","Albert, Michael J.

265,pub.1019490636,10.1159/000095125,,,,Breast Cancer Surgery – Oncological Aspects,"Preoperative clinical examination, mammography, ultrasound and, in selected cases, magnetic resonance imaging provide information about TN status, tumor localization and a potential intraductal component. Diagnosis should be confirmed by preoperative core-needle biopsy histology, grading, hormone receptor status, and HER2/neu expression etc. in order to estimate risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy. If systemic risk is high, preoperative staging with bone scintigraphy, chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound or CT identify patients with metastatic disease, who will not necessarily benefit from radical surgery. Most patients with T1-tumors are candidates for breast conserving surgery (BCT), which, in combination with radiotherapy of the breast, is as safe as mastectomy. Margins should be free of tumor. Only multicentric disease, inflammatory breast cancer and unfavorable tumor versus breast volume are contraindications for BCT. Plastic surgery often allows resection of large tissue volumes with good cosmesis and minimal scars and may help to avoid mastectomy in many cases. Concerning axillary surgery, the resection of at least 10 lymph nodes has been considered standard. Axillary surgery is responsible for the majority of postoperative morbidity. In very small tumors and in the elderly with clinically negative axillae and small tumors there is some evidence that omitting axillary surgery may not reduce survival rates. In clinically node-negative patients with unifocal tumors not exceeding 5 cm sentinel lymph node excision is widely accepted although long-term survival data are still lacking. Multicentricity, inflammatory disease and extensive prior breast surgery and prior surgery of the axilla are contraindications for sentinel lymph node excision.",,,Breast Care,,Karger Publishers,"1661-3791, 1661-3805",,2006-09-05,2006,2006-09-05,2006,1,4,229-233,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Nitz, Ulrike; Grosse, Regina; Thomssen, Christoph","Nitz, Ulrike (Universitäts-Frauenklinik Düsseldorf, Klinik u.

240,pub.1122169161,10.2139/ssrn.3475828,,,,Extended Shareholder Liability for Systemically Important Financial Institutions,"Regulators generally have tried to address the problems posed by the excessive risk-taking of Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) by placing restrictions on the activities in which SIFIs engage. However, the complexity of these institutions makes such attempts necessarily imperfect. This article proposes to address the problem at its very source, which is the incentives that SIFI owners have to push for excessive risk-taking by managers. Building on the traditional rule of “double liability”, we propose to modify the current (general) rule limiting the liability of SIFI shareholders to the amount of their initial investments in such companies. We propose replacing the extant limited liability regime with a new system that imposes additional liability over and above what SIFI shareholders already have invested in a pre-set amount that varies with a SIFI’s centrality in the financial network. Our liability regime has a number of advantages. First, by increasing shareholder exposure to downside risk, it discourages excessive risk-taking. At the same time, by placing a clearly defined ceiling on shareholders’ total liability exposure, it will not obliterate shareholders’ incentives to invest in the first place. Second, the liability to which shareholders are exposed is carefully tailored to the level of systemic risk that their institution creates. Thus, our rule induces shareholders to account for the negative externality SIFIs can impose without unduly stifling such financial institutions’ role within the financial system and in the wider economy. Third, as the amount of liability is clearly defined ex ante using the rigorous tools of network theory, our rule minimizes the influence of interest groups and the impact of idiosyncratic government decisions. Last, as markets know in advance the amount of liability to which shareholders are exposed, our rule favors the creation of a vibrant insurance and derivative market so that the risk of SIFIs defaults can be allocated to those who can better bear it.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Romano, Alessandro; Enriques, Luca; Macey, Jonathan R.","Romano, Alessandro (Yale Law School); Enriques, Luca (University of Oxford Faculty of Law; European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI)); Macey, Jonathan R.

167,pub.1069356433,10.22495/jgr_v1_i3_c1_p4,,,,IS PRINCIPLE BASED LEGISLATION SMART CHOICE FOR CAPITAL MARKET’S REGULATION,"Global financial crisis in 2008 posted numerous questions about the reasons and triggers. In past three years world’s economic literature has been full of academic articles analysing each reason or trigger and scientific explanations of possible connections. Majority outcome was, that key factor was excessive use of derivatives and synthetic financial products, which were under regulated or not regulated at all. The outcome was that countries with developed financial markets introduced new regulations and controls in the field of derivatives and synthetic financial products. Term “systemic risk” was introduced in global financial market. But will this approach really prevent such global crisis? Submission is divided in three parts.
First part deals with the theory of principle based regulation. Principle based regulation was firstly introduced in UK and latter accepted by European Union in the field of capital markets. It was a way, together with the Lamfalussy process, to make EU regulation acceptable for all member states. Instead of detailed prescribed behaviour, legislation texts prescribe only desirable goals. Implementation is left to each state or, even worse, to each supervised subject. So the implementation should depend on the capital market’s development, capital product’s structure, tradition, investment companies’ size etc. From a distant view, principle based legislation could be seen as a great legislation writing’s technique. It could be seen as an effective solution to regulate a fast developing field without need to change the regulation. But is it true?
Second part of the submission addresses the legal questions and problems, connected to the principle based regulation starting with the validity of regulations. Broad definitions in Market in financial instruments Directive (MiFID), introduced for fast adaptation to new financial products and instruments, are now turning into dinosaurs. Contrary to US’s fast action, European Union is still discussing whether spot forex trade is financial instrument or not. On the other hand, broad and unclear definitions, represents a friendly environment for new casino’s financial products. Even recognised financial instruments (like derivatives and synthetic financial instruments) are recognised as gambling contracts by national courts within European Union. Problems with legal enforcement of financial contracts are mentioned also in common law’s literature. There are numerous pages describing the economic and financial essence of each derivative or synthetic financial instrument. But the chapters, dealing with the legal aspects, are short and end with a similar advice: “due to small number of case law and the danger, that courts could interpret such contracts as a gambling contract, we strongly advise to settle all disputes outside the court.” In case of numerous defaults unenforceability of contracts could be the poison pill for the trust in capital markets. Accepted solutions could also be a problem for administrative or criminal sanctions. Broad and unclear definitions could violate the basic principle “nullum crimen sine lege praevia.” And least but not last, in modern financial world sins are made in interpretations of details and not of principles.
Third part of submission deals with the necessary assumptions for a workable principle based legislation. It starts with basic legal culture and generally accepted rule of law. It deals with the corporate culture, consumer’s organizations, financial markets and capable supervisors. Only when all the actors perform their expected roles, the principle based legislation could work properly.",,,Journal of Governance and Regulation,,Virtus Interpress,"2220-9352, 2306-6784",,2012,2012,2012,2012,1,3,107-113,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Stražišar, Borut","Stražišar, Borut ()",,"Stražišar, Borut ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,https://doi.org/10.22495/jgr_v1_i3_c1_p4,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069356433,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C18 Law,,dims

Firstly, an analysis is made on how fiscal policy may become unsustainable, whether it is due to a worsening of the fundamentals of a country, or to increasing international financial turmoil. Particular attention is paid to the literature on the role of financial institutions and their sovereign links in a crisis context. This link may mean that sovereign stress is transferred to the banks, via holdings of sovereign debt or vice versa, on account of the implicit (or explicit) guarantee that banks may have from the sovereign. Secondly, a review is made of the determining factors of the connectedness amongst financial institutions and between sovereign banks. The indicators of connectedness can help understand how systemic risk builds up.

Over the past five years, in order to find an answer to the above question, there has been a radical shift in our research strategy: The principles of fluid dynamics in industrial and domestic pipes/pipelines were employed to decipher changes in the cardiovascular system. The types of flow under investigation included laminar, entrance, turbulent, and helical flows in systole and diastole, as well as the interface between antegrade and retrograde flows resulting in water hammer shock and cavitation phenomena. We aim to highlight the similarities and differences among flow types in arteries and pipes and apply the same methodologies to study the formation, growth, and rupture of coronary plaques leading to inactive and active clinical syndromes and the beneficial mechanism of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). In this article, we list the questions and the answers based on the primary data of several completed studies and the preliminary results of ongoing projects from a fluid mechanics perspective.

Reforms are urgently needed as it is a complex system with many levels that involves products, institutions and markets. Shadow banks can be described as financial intermediaries that perform banking functions outside the traditional commercial banking system. Chinese researchers have defined shadow banking under three frameworks: regulation theory, risk theory and non-traditional credit theory. According to our research, shadow banking in China accounts for 19 % of total assets of the banking industry and is worth 27 trillion yuan. Shadow banking has plenty of systemic risks. The intrinsic non-traditional credit expansion mechanism (shadow banking business) of banking in the financial system has been identified as the major cause of the accumulation of systemic risks in finance. Despite its success and rapid development, shadow banking has also exposed the cracks in China’s financial system.

Based on the evolutionary-institutional analysis and systems analysis methods, the study identifies the threats of digitalization and the associated macroeconomic risks and describes the current approaches to digital risk management. The evolution in the understanding of risk and contemporary approaches to risk assessment is traced in relation to business, social, economic, investment, military, and political threats. Among the critical risks of digitalization, an important place is occupied by cyber risks, which are part of the strategic risks of enterprises, credit risks and regulatory risks. These risks affect markets and create a systemic risk stemming from the possible damage to elements of the infrastructure and market. Technology-driven risks have a systemic character as they may affect more than one country, economic sector, as well as a wide range of natural, technological, and social systems. The study offers an analysis of digitalization risk assessment methods (STRIDE, CIA, OCTAVE) and provides an overview of the qualitative and quantitative methods used to assess digital threats. Modern approaches to cyber risk management include modeling threats and vulnerabilities. These methods may prove especially useful to identify, classify and prioritize threats and to develop selective risk reduction measures. The concepts of FinTech and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) are discussed in relation to the associated risks to the stability of national and international financial systems.

This ownership creates tensions between governments' social goals and bank efficiency since bank lending decisions are not based on the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. The paper examines the costs of this tension that include inadequate access to bank finance for productive borrowers, foregone efficiencies in the debt markets and systemic risks of mis-directed lending and bank investments. The paper provides comparative estimates of the systemic risks and concludes that reforms have reduced these risks. Further reform is required as these economies become more complex since pressures for efficient financial systems will grow.

We document that these spillovers are subject to substantial slow information diffusion: On average, the effect of extreme losses of one firm resolve only after roughly 1.5 months, implying that markets react slowly to firm-specific extreme losses. We refer to this phenomenon as late resolution of economic shocks. Popular systemic risk measures do not capture this late resolution and, as a consequence, substantially underestimate systemic risk. We provide a framework to measure late resolution, the Conditional Shortfall Probability (CoSP), and provide empirical evidence that is consistent with late resolution being driven by slow information diffusion, complexity, and interconnectedness of firms. We also find that build-ups of systemic risk are characterized by an increase in late resolution of economic shocks. This suggests that complexity and interconnectedness increases prior to financial crises, which is captured by CoSP. Thus, late resolution of economic shocks is a decisive element of systemic risk and has important implications for the design of macro-prudential policies.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2016,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kubitza, Christian; Gründl, Helmut","Kubitza, Christian (University of Bonn - Institute for Financial Economics and Statistics); Gründl, Helmut (Goethe University Frankfurt - Department of Finance; International Center for Insurance Regulation)",,"Kubitza, Christian (University of Bonn); Gründl, Helmut (Goethe University Frankfurt)",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Bonn,grid.7839.5; grid.10388.32,Frankfurt am Main; Bonn,Hessen; ,Germany; Germany,,,,,,3,2,,1.14,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102467350,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

However, critics often look at international lawmaking by “sub-national actors” and “regulatory networks of bureaucrats” with deep skepticism on the ground that it lacks accountability and legitimacy compared to lawmaking at the national level. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) serves as a counterexample. BCBS has been the foremost runner in promoting a harmonized global standard for banking regulation to remove systemic risk and strengthen the banking system. Despite perceived “democratic deficit” in such an international lawmaking process, BCBS has successfully developed three banking regulatory frameworks since the 1980s, which have been widely adopted worldwide, ranging from the most developed economies to countries with less sophisticated financial systems. This article aims to assess the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Basel Framework through a systematic account of the dynamics between states at the international level and within each state domestically during different stages of its development. Section 1 introduces the background of the international financial system in the 1970s, which served as the stimulus of the subsequent creation of the Basel Accord. Section 2 discusses the motivation behind the creation of BCBS in the early 1980s and presents paradoxical views on the interest alignment among participating states. Section 3 examines the formulation of the Basel Accord at the transnational level and the efforts that were made to enhance the legitimacy and accountability of this piece of soft law. Section 4 reviews the implementation of the rules at the national level through comparisons between the initial members of the framework and new participants, along with a look at non-member states that have also been strongly influenced by the Basel Framework.",,,Peking University Law Journal,,Taylor & Francis,"2051-7483, 2052-5907",,2018-07-03,2018,2019-04-24,2018-07-03,6,2,323-369,Closed,Article,"Min, Jie","Min, Jie ()",,"Min, Jie ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113674631,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 44 Human Society; 4408 Political Science",,,,,,C19 Politics and International Studies,,dims

Here, we construct a series of global crude oil correlated networks based on the historical 57 oil prices covering a period from 1993 to 2012. Two systemic risk indicators are constructed based on the density and modularity of correlated networks. The local maximums of the risk indicators are found to have the ability to predict the trends of oil prices. In our sample periods, the indicator based on the network density sends five signals and the indicator based on the modularity index sends four signals. The four signals sent by both indicators are able to warn the drop of future oil prices and the signal only sent by the network density is followed by a huge rise of oil prices. Our results deepen the application of network measures on building early warning models of systemic risks and can be applied to predict the trends of future prices in financial markets.","This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11075054 and 71571121), Shanghai ‘Chen Guang’ Project (2012CG34), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (222201718006).",,Physica A Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,,Elsevier,"0378-4371, 1873-2119",,2018-01,2018,,2018-01,490,,1335-1343,Closed,Article,"Yu, Jia-Wei; Xie, Wen-Jie; Jiang, Zhi-Qiang","Yu, Jia-Wei (Department of Finance, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China); Xie, Wen-Jie (Department of Finance, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China); Jiang, Zhi-Qiang (Department of Finance, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China; Research Center for Econophysics, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China)","Xie, Wen-Jie (East China University of Science and Technology; East China University of Science and Technology); Jiang, Zhi-Qiang (East China University of Science and Technology; East China University of Science and Technology)","Yu, Jia-Wei (East China University of Science and Technology); Xie, Wen-Jie (East China University of Science and Technology; East China University of Science and Technology); Jiang, Zhi-Qiang (East China University of Science and Technology; East China University of Science and Technology)",East China University of Science and Technology,grid.28056.39,Shanghai,,China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,,China,grant.4996114; grant.8322935,11075054; 71571121,16,10,,9.76,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091406802,49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics; 4902 Mathematical Physics,,,,,,B12 Engineering,,dims

226,pub.1153625963,10.2139/ssrn.4283808,,,,Three Essays on Asset Pricing Studies,"Traditional consumption-based asset pricing models treat the aggregate stock market as a claim to aggregate consumption. However, according to empirical evidence, most households consume primarily out of wages and live with no capital gains from risky investments. This implies potential omitted stock market systematic risk sources beyond aggregate consumption. Therefore, this thesis contributes to investigating alternative pricing instruments other than aggregate consumption growth to capture omitted stock market systematic risks in the traditional consumption-based capital asset pricing model (CAPM). This thesis constructs three asset pricing models for wealth redistribution risks, asset pricing effects of heterogeneous beliefs among wealth classes, and financial stress risks. A new market systematic risk dimension is uncovered in each model and then tested using U.S. stock market data. This thesis first incorporates the elevated stockholder consumption volatility into the long-run risk framework to account for wealth redistribution risks. The capital variability factor (CRV) is developed to capture the accumulated short-run volatility effects of wealth redistributive shocks. Secondly, this thesis derives the analytical solution of stockholder consumption growth to account for stockholder consumption risks using a robustness control approach. The stockholder consumption share factor (SCS) is constructed to portray the stockholder consumption dynamics and affords high asset pricing. Finally, this thesis utilises the long-run risk framework to factor in that financial stress contributes to the convexity of the price-dividend ratio and, therefore, serves systematic risks. The financial stress factor (FS) is developed to explain the cross-sectional return variations of stocks with highly subjective valuations and are difficult to arbitrage.This thesis contributes to the field in multiple dimensions. This thesis attempts to introduce economic variables into data-driven models, therefore shedding light on the impact of limited participation of households in the stock market for future research. Also, new market systematic risks are uncovered and counterpart asset pricing factors are constructed.

Yet, the bilateral linkages of these institutions and thus the true structure of the network are typically unobservable, with leading reconstruction methods, such as maximum entropy or minimum density, potentially underestimating the true contagion risk of the network. Based on publicly available data from large European institutions, this paper analyses different network reconstruction techniques and the contagion risk impact of different network structures in a stress testing context. My findings suggest that uncertainty about the true interbank network leads to substantially varying risk assessments, where a Bayesian reconstruction approach can be used to identify contagion risk boundaries.

We observe long-memory processes in these structures in the form of power law decays in the number of persistent motifs. The decays then transition to a plateau regime with a power-law decay with smaller exponent. We demonstrate that identifying persistent motifs allows for forecasting and applications to portfolio diversification. Balanced portfolios are often constructed from the analysis of historic correlations, however not all past correlations are persistently reflected into the future. Sector neutrality has also been a central theme in portfolio diversification and systemic risk. We present an unsupervised technique to identify persistently correlated sets of stocks. These are empirically found to identify sectors driven by strong fundamentals. Applications of these findings are tested in two distinct ways on four different markets, resulting in significant reduction in portfolio volatility.

At the same time, fintech may cause potential systemic risk in the financial sector, which has aroused special concerns from financial regulatory authorities. Based on the micro data of China’s listed banks from 2013 to 2020, this paper analyzes the impact of fintech development on systemic risk in China’s banking industry and its mechanism. It reveals that for a micro bank, fintech progress increases its risk-taking and enhances inter-bank linkages, which results in significantly amplified systemic risk, and the impact is time-lagged and persistent. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the impacts of fintech on state-owned banks and other banks are heterogeneous and the margining risk of state-owned banks is lower when the fintech improves. It is also found that enhancing macroprudential supervision can reduce the systemic risk spillover of fintech. Robustness analyses including GMM regression and the method of instrumental variables prove that the conclusion is robust.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) patterns surrounding GA, baseline GA size, the presence of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), the condition of the fellow eye and the presence of systemic vascular diseases (diabetes, atherosclerosis, systemic hypertension) on the progression of GA due to age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: Seventy-five eyes of 52 patients with GA were included into this retrospective study. Digital FAF images were achieved using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Areas of GA were measured with the Region Finder software program on an Heidelberg Retinal Angiograph 2. FAF patterns around GA were classified and the presence of RPD and systemic diseases were noted. The median follow-up of the patients was 2.6 years (interquartile range, 1-9.2).
RESULTS: The median progression rate of the banded pattern (median 0.97 mm2/year) was significantly higher than the other patterns (median 0.85 mm2/year) (p = 0.03). Eyes with RPD had a significantly higher progression rate (median 1.21 mm2/year) than those without RPD (median 0.79 mm2/year) (p = 0.007). The presence of systemic diseases was not related with lesion progression rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the banded pattern and the presence of RPD accelerate the progression of GA and function as predictive factors.",Declaration of Competing Interest The author reports no conflicts of interest in this work.,,Photodiagnosis and Photodynamic Therapy,,Elsevier,"1572-1000, 1873-1597",Disease Progression; Fluorescein Angiography; Geographic Atrophy; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors,2021-01-02,2021,2021-01-02,2021-03,33,,102171,Closed,Article,"Sahinoglu-Keskek, Nedime; Sermet, Figen","Sahinoglu-Keskek, Nedime (Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, Adana Research and Training Center, Department of Ophthalmology, Adana, Turkey.

Human activities which consume such resources need to be reconsidered in a way which allows the regenerative capacity of these assets to function. In view of the potential danger of the concept of sustainable development, the term Sustainable Development was defined as something which “meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Sustainable development and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) try to provide a growth parameter which eliminates extreme poverty. The MDGs focuses more on the social dimension of development, covering issues such as hunger, education, gender equality, child and maternal health and combating major diseases. The MDG's was initiated by the United Nations in 2000 as an ambitious development agenda to tackle frontally and headlong by 2015, the multifaceted socio-economic challenges stifling economic growth and sustainable development in most developing and under-developed countries (UN, 2000).

264,pub.1149858479,10.2139/ssrn.4171056,,,,Can Trade Credit Rejuvenate Islamic Banking?,"This study proposes a renewal of the contemporary Islamic banking Murabaha financing model as it aggravates financial fragility with waning economic efficiency. We adapt the working capital framework of successful US companies like Amazon and Walmart and model an innovative Murabaha facility as trade credit within the real sector of the economy. We then test its robustness in a range of simulation tests.Our approach is novel and stands in contrast to the familiar financial sector fixed-income facilities, characteristic of Western economies, stealthily mimicked as mark-up (interest rate based) Murabaha by Islamic banks. We argue that this is neither appropriate nor effective for Islamic economies, making them fragile under monetary pressures in crises like the current coronavirus and energy ones. Our simulation results indicate that the trade credit Murabaha not only transforms debt into a risk-sharing one but also offers more competitive financing rates, reduces systemic risk, and improves financial stability. Furthermore, our results imply that the trade credit Murabaha can increase the efficiency of Islamic financial systems and make them more resilient to shocks.Consequently, this paper discusses the integration of our novel Murabaha within a recreated architecture of Universal Banking. As an implication, this should promote business activity and contribute to global growth. Finally, we recommend how to deploy our novel Murabaha based on trade credit (as opposed to the currently deployed fixed-income-mimicked Murabaha) to alleviate twin agency debt costs (risk shifting, underinvestment) and solve the ownership transfer problem of modern Islamic banking.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2022,2022,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Jatmiko, Wahyu; Ebrahim, Muhammed Shahid; Iqbal, Abdullah; Wojakowski, Rafal M.","Jatmiko, Wahyu (Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Indonesia); Ebrahim, Muhammed Shahid (Durham Business School); Iqbal, Abdullah (University of Kent, Canterbury); Wojakowski, Rafal M.

By using mixed integer linear programming, financial linkages are optimally organized, whereas the overall economic conditions of banks, such as capital buffers, total interbank assets and liabilities, and average risk-weighted exposure remain unchanged. We apply the new optimization procedure to 10 snapshots of the Austrian interbank market where we focus on the largest 70 banks covering 71% of the market volume. The optimization reduces systemic risk (measured in DebtRank) by about 70%, showing the huge potential that changing the network structure has on the mitigation of financial contagion. Existing capital levels would need to be scaled up by a factor of 3.3 to obtain similar levels of DebtRank. These findings underline the importance of macro-prudential rules that focus on the structure of financial networks. The new optimization procedure allows us to benchmark actual networks to networks with minimal systemic risk. We find that simple topological measures, like link density, degree assortativity, or clustering coefficient, fail to explain the large differences in systemic risk between actual and optimal networks. We find that if the most systemically relevant banks are tightly connected, overall systemic risk is higher than if they are unconnected.","CD acknowledges funding from the WWTF project Stochastic Filtering and Corporate and Sovereign Credit Risk project number MA14-031, PI Rüdiger Frey, and the OeNB anniversary fund project Dynamic measures of systemic risk, project number 17793, PI Birgit Rudloff.

Regulators were initially fearful of choking off the economic boom while at the same time underestimating the power of leverage and the riskiness of many of the arcane financial instruments that were being marketed and sold so aggressively and widely by investment banks in the so called “shadow banking system”. The degree of potential systemic risk was also underestimated. Investor panic and fear of default on subprime mortgages played a central role and this was compounded by the lack of risk transparency. In most cases it was a liquidity crisis not a solvency crisis. Since banks were unwilling to lend to each other even solvent banks were stressed because they were unable to meet withdrawal demands of jittery investors or to meet their short-term obligations that had been traditionally dealt with through short-term borrowing or trade credit. The crisis of confidence was widespread. The secondary impact of the subprime mortgage crisis was a crisis of trust and expectations which often morphed into depositor panic and sharp deterioration of equity markets. This perceived risk resulted in loss of capital and deposits and could only be stopped by sale to a more stable bank or by government or central bank intervention. By the fall of 2009 it became clear that the bottom of the recession has been reached while the process of rebuilding confidence and further growth began slowly and with substantial caution. The IMF downgraded its outlook several times beginning in September of 2008. In its report released in the spring of 2009 it speaks of the “corrosive global feedback loop that has undermined policymakers’ efforts to remedy the situation” (IMF, 2009, Chapter 1, p. 4).",,,,Asia and the Global Economic Crisis,Springer Nature,,,2010,2010,,2010,,,36-48,Closed,Chapter,"Dowling, John Malcolm; Rana, Pradumna Bickram","Dowling, John Malcolm (); Rana, Pradumna Bickram ()",,"Dowling, John Malcolm (); Rana, Pradumna Bickram ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046286996,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

This paper aims at building and validating a new class of early warning signals of critical transitions. We base our analysis on information spreading patterns in dynamic temporal networks, where nodes are connected by short-term causality. Before a tipping point occurs, we observe flickering in information spreading, as measured by clustering coefficients. Nodes rapidly switch between ""being in"" and ""being out"" the information diffusion process. Concurrently, stock markets start to desynchronize. To capture these features, we build two early warning indicators based on the number of regime switches, and on the time between two switches. We divide our data into two sub-samples. Over the first one, using receiver operating curve, we show that we are able to detect a tipping point about one year before it occurs. For instance, our empirical model perfectly predicts the Global Financial Crisis. Over the second sub-sample, used as a robustness check, our two statistical metrics also capture, to a large extent, the 2016 financial turmoil.

Specifically, we study the consequence of the introduction of a financial innovation that allow reducing the cost of portfolio diversification in a financial system populated by financial institutions having capital requirements in the form of VaR constraint, and following standard mark-to-market and risk management rules. We provide a full analytical quantification of the multivariate feedback effects between investment prices and bank behavior induced by portfolio re-balancing in presence of asset lliquidity, and show how changes in the constraints of the bank portfolio optimization endogenously drive the dynamics of the balance sheet aggregate of financial institutions and, thereby, the availability of bank liquidity to the economic system and systemic risk. The model shows that when financial innovation reduces the cost of diversification below a given threshold, the strength (due to higher leverage) and coordination (due to similarity of bank portfolios) of feedback effects increase, triggering a transition from a stationary dynamics of price returns to a non stationary one characterized by steep growths (bubbles) and plunges (bursts) of market prices.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2013,2013,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Corsi, Fulvio; Marmi, Stefano; Lillo, Fabrizio","Corsi, Fulvio (University of Pisa - Department of Economics; City University London); Marmi, Stefano (Scuola Normale Superiore); Lillo, Fabrizio (Università di Bologna)",,"Corsi, Fulvio (); Marmi, Stefano (Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa); Lillo, Fabrizio (University of Bologna)",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; University of Bologna,grid.6093.c; grid.6292.f,Pisa; Bologna,Toscana; Emilia-Romagna,Italy; Italy,,,,,,24,0,,9.29,1.0,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/19451/1/When%20Micro%20Prudence%20increases%20Macro%20Risk.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102380548,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

Accordingly, Similar to other complex systems, financial markets are also exposed to systemic risks. Considering the importance of systemic risks in financial markets, we reviewed different concepts, definitions, and the related principles of the systemic risk. For this purpose, we represent a detailed review of the main characteristics of the complex systems which lead to systemic risk in different aspects. We also reviewed the main definitions of financial systemic risk in different aspects. To analyze the systemic risks in the financial markets, we introduce the main approaches of systemic risk analysis and elaborate financial network analysis as one of the main approaches. The results show that the systemic risk events can be related to the buildup of small shock on different agents in the financial systems as well as great shocks in one or a few numbers of financial agents.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Dastkhan, Hossein","Dastkhan, Hossein (Kharazmi University)",,"Dastkhan, Hossein (Kharazmi University)",Kharazmi University,grid.412265.6,Tehran,,Iran,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125431145,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

We model the influence of sharing large exogeneous losses to the financial or (re)insurance market by a bipartite graph. Using Pareto-tailed losses and multivariate regular variation, we obtain asymptotic results for conditional risk measures based on the Value-at-Risk and the Conditional Tail Expectation. These results allow us to assess the influence of an individual institution on the systemic or market risk and vice versa through a collection of conditional risk measures. For large markets, Poisson approximations of the relevant constants are provided. Differences of the conditional risk measures for an underlying homogeneous and inhomogeneous random graph are illustrated by simulations.","CK would like to thank Keble College, Oxford, for their support through a Senior Research Visitorship.

Effects of Cross-Country Capital Regulation Gaps,"We examine how cross-country differences in capital regulations shape the structure of global lending syndicates. Using globally syndicated loans extended by banks from 44 countries, we find that strictly regulated banks participate more in syndicates originated by lead lenders facing less stringent capital regulations. This finding is consistent with the explanation that strictly regulated banks seek risky deals outside the border and loosely regulated banks have an advantage to procure such deals. Accordingly, lending syndicates involving loosely regulated lead arrangers and strictly regulated participants extend loans to riskier borrowers, charge higher spreads, and incur higher default rates. The effect of regulatory differences is mitigated when participants are subject to higher accounting standards, and amplified when the participant and lead banks share prior syndicate relations. Finally, we show that global syndication exposes both participants and lead arrangers to greater systemic risk.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2018,2018,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Gao, Janet; Jang, Yeejin","Gao, Janet (Indiana University - Kelley School of Business); Jang, Yeejin (UNSW Australia Business School, School of Banking and Finance)",,"Gao, Janet (Indiana University); Jang, Yeejin ()",Indiana University,grid.257410.5,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,1,1,,0.48,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101050047,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",Prevention,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

We employ ΔCoVaR (delta conditional value-at-risk) as a measure of systemic risk and earnings forecast bias to measure CEO overconfidence. We use a fixed effects panel regression approach to evaluate the effect of CEO overconfidence, firm-level factors, and systemic risk. Our findings show that banks that are managed by overconfident CEOs enhance the firm’s contributions to systemic risk. Empirical results also show that the firm’s size, leverage ratio, and loan ratio increase the firm’s contributions to systemic risk.

The paper explores their respective constituent concepts and fields of application in crime assessment, drawing upon qualitative research-in-progress in Belgium. Risk calculation, as applied to crime, starts with past data on routines that link perpetrators with targets that lack capable guardians. Precautionary uncertainty focuses on potential impacts that are highly disabling and potentially wide-spreading (contagion, knock-on effects), asking how such impacts can be contained and recovered from. Risk and uncertainty are shown to be related to ‘rational-instrumental’ and ‘deliberative-constitutive’ approaches as developed by Fisher’s work in the field of law, which offers a meta-narrative in relation to which they can be positioned. Finally, the paper asks if these two crime assessment methods should be seen as distinct or as merging.

Our goal is to propose a consistent approach for managing major risk in urban systems by bringing together emergency management, organisational resilience, and climate change adaptation.   Design/methodology/approach We develop a theory-building process using an example from the work of the Greater London Authority in the United Kingdom. First, we explore how emergency management approaches systemic risk, including examples from of exercises, contingency plans and responses to complex incidents. Secondly, we analyse how systemic risk is integrated into strategies and practices of climate change adaptation. Thirdly, we consider organisational resilience as a cross cutting element between the approaches.   Findings London has long been a champion of resilience strategies for dealing with systemic risk. However, this paper highlights a potential for integrating better the understanding of common points of failure in society and organisations, especially where they relate to interconnected domains and where they are driven by climate change.

We provide a unique approach to simulating the financial market along with demonstrating the phenomenon of emergence resulting from the interconnected-behavior of consumers, banks and the Federal Reserve. Consumers can buy or rent properties, and these agents own characteristics such as income and may be employed or unemployed. Banks own balance sheets to monitor their assets and liabilities and participate in the interbank lending market with one another. This tool can assess the complexity of the United States’ housing market, conduct stress tests as interest rates fluctuate, and explore the landmark financial crisis and epidemic of foreclosures. This is important because understanding the impact from increases in foreclosed properties and changes in rates can help policymakers and bankers have a better understanding of the complexity within the housing market.",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Advances in Human Factors in Simulation and Modeling,Springer Nature,"2194-5357, 2194-5365",,2018-06-27,2018,2018-06-27,2019,780,,246-253,Closed,Chapter,"Khan, Faizan; Yang, Zining","Khan, Faizan (Claremont Graduate University, 91711, Claremont, CA, USA); Yang, Zining (Claremont Graduate University, 91711, Claremont, CA, USA)","Khan, Faizan (Claremont Graduate University)","Khan, Faizan (Claremont Graduate University); Yang, Zining (Claremont Graduate University)",Claremont Graduate University,grid.254271.7,Claremont,California,United States,,,,,,1,0,,0.49,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105137818,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,"C13 Architecture, Built Environment and Planning",,dims

Some of the most urgent challenges facing those responsible for improving and regulating patient safety are therefore how to identify, interpret, integrate and act on the early warnings and weak signals of emerging risks-before those risks contribute to a disastrous failure of care. These challenges are fundamentally organisational and cultural: they relate to what information is routinely noticed, communicated and attended to within and between healthcare organisations-and, most critically, what is assumed and ignored. Analysing these organisational and cultural challenges suggests three practical ways that healthcare organisations and their regulators can improve safety and address emerging risks. First, engage in practices that actively produce and amplify fleeting signs of ignorance. Second, work to continually define and update a set of specific fears of failure. And third, routinely uncover and publicly circulate knowledge on the sources of systemic risks to patient safety and the improvements required to address them.",,,BMJ Quality & Safety,,BMJ,"2044-5415, 1470-7934, 2044-5423",Disasters; England; Hospital Administration; Hospitals; Humans; Malpractice,2014-03-05,2014,2014-03-05,2014-06,23,6,440,Closed,Article,"Macrae, Carl","Macrae, Carl ()",,"Macrae, Carl ()",,,,,,,,,,,61,25,2.07,13.59,47.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002915140,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,Patient Safety,Generic health relevance,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Insurance core function is managing risks driven by nature or related to human life. To support it, insurance companies perform the functions of pooling of resources, transferring of resources, and information production and management. Four major financial innovations affected the insurance business: hedging of market risks with derivatives, securitization of underwriting risks, asset management and credit intermediation activities of the shadow banking. While hedging of market risks with derivatives and securitization of underwriting risks enhanced industry effectiveness to perform its core functions, asset management and shadow banking activities introduced new functions of supporting the payment system and asset prices. In performing new functions, insurers compete with other financial intermediaries and markets. The analysis implies that an economic activity rather than a legal entity needs to be the basis of systemic risk regulation framework in insurance. This would also provide a coherent framework to regulate various intermediaries involved in economically equivalent activities.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2014,2014,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Kartasheva, Anastasia V.","Kartasheva, Anastasia V.

This article attempts to rethink the corporate governance assumption that owners of firms should always have their liability limited to the capital they have invested. In the relatively small and decentralized firms that dominate shadow banking, equity investors tend to be active managers. Limited liability gives these investor-managers strong incentives to take risks that could generate outsized personal profits, even if that greatly increases systemic risk. For shadow banking firms subject to this conflict, limited liability should be redesigned to better align investor and societal interests.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2013,2013,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Schwarcz, Steven L.","Schwarcz, Steven L.

Substantial scientific work has been conducted to establish a proper foundation for this concept and its applications. Nonetheless, there are still some issues that remain to be clarified, for example how to best characterise risks and risk problems that need risk governance approaches. The purpose of the present article is to provide new insights into the risk governance concept by critically examining some common definitions and uses of key terms. In particular, the article seeks to shed new light on the interpretation of risk-problem classes: simple, complex, uncertain and ambiguous.

In it, firms form joint ventures called ‘links’ which are subsequently subjected to either good or bad shocks. Bad shocks incentivize default. Links yield full benefits only if the counter-party does not subsequently default on the project. Accordingly, defaults triggered by bad shocks render firms insolvent and defaults propagate via links. The model yields three insights. First, stable networks with ex-ante identical agents exhibit a core–periphery structure. Second, an increase in the probability of good shocks increases systemic risk. Third, because the network formed depends on the correlation between shocks to links, an observer who misconceives the correlation will underestimate the probability of system-wide default by a factor of a half.",,,European Economic Review,,Elsevier,"0014-2921, 1873-572X",,2022-09,2022,,2022-09,148,,104213,All OA; Green,Article,"Erol, Selman; Vohra, Rakesh","Erol, Selman (Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America); Vohra, Rakesh (Department of Economics and Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, United States of America)","Vohra, Rakesh (University of Pennsylvania)","Erol, Selman (Carnegie Mellon University); Vohra, Rakesh (University of Pennsylvania)",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Pennsylvania,grid.147455.6; grid.25879.31,Pittsburgh; Philadelphia,Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania,United States; United States,Rockefeller Foundation,,United States,,,4,4,,,,https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/filevault/14-029.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149337735,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics,,,,,,C16 Economics and Econometrics; C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

In a two-country and three-period model, correlated asset fire sales by banks generate systemic risk across national financial markets. Relaxing regulatory standards in one country increases both the cost and the severity of crises for both countries in this framework. In the absence of coordination, independent regulators choose inefficiently low levels of macro-prudential regulation. A central regulator internalizes the systemic risk and thereby can improve the welfare of coordinating countries. Symmetric countries always benefit from coordination. Asymmetric countries choose different levels of macro-prudential regulation when they act independently.

To investigate and report the iatrogenic form of spinal infections that occur after injection therapy in the spine. An iatrogenic infection after injection therapy in the spine is rarely reported to be a serious complication. However, an increase in the number of immunocompromised patients, the aging of the population, and particularly an increase in spinal procedureshave precipitated a rise in the incidence of spinal infections. Iatrogenic spinal infections occurred in 8 patients after various injection therapy in the spine, which included an epidural steroid injection or trigger point injection for various spinal conditions. The medical records and images of these patients regarding the clinical findings, risk factors, and treatments were analyzed. The pathologic conditions of the spinal infection were discitis in four patients with a concomitant infection in the epidural space and paraspinal muscles, an epidural abscess, and solitary muscular abscess or myositis in the other 3 patients. The systemic risk factors contributing to the infections were diabetes mellitus, metastatic cancer, and chronic liver disease in four patients. For treatment, intensive antibiotic therapy was applied to all patients. Six of the 8 patients underwent surgical drainage for abscesses and/or fusion to stabilize the infected segments. The infections were eventually controlled in all patients. Iatrogenic pyogenic infections of the spine after injection therapy in the spine is a serious complication with regard morbidity and treatment.

there are essentially two options for future financial regulation of systemic
risk (SR): First, financial regulation could attempt to reduce the financial
fragility of global or domestic systemically important financial institutions
(G-SIBs or D-SIBs), as for instance proposed in Basel III. Second, future
financial regulation could attempt strengthening the financial system as a
whole. This can be achieved by re-shaping the topology of financial networks.
We use an agent-based model (ABM) of a financial system and the real economy to
study and compare the consequences of these two options. By conducting three
""computer experiments"" with the ABM we find that re-shaping financial networks
is more effective and efficient than reducing leverage. Capital surcharges for
G-SIBs can reduce SR, but must be larger than those specified in Basel III in
order to have a measurable impact. This can cause a loss of efficiency. Basel
III capital surcharges for G-SIBs can have pro-cyclical side effects.",,,arXiv,,,,,2016-02-10,2016,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Poledna, Sebastian; Bochmann, Olaf; Thurner, Stefan","Poledna, Sebastian (); Bochmann, Olaf (); Thurner, Stefan ()",,"Poledna, Sebastian (); Bochmann, Olaf (); Thurner, Stefan ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,5.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119381055,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,10 Reduced Inequalities,dims

We compute ΔCoVaR, MES and CES by utilizing EVT principles for modelling marginal distributions and Student’s t copula for describing the dependence structure between every bank and the banking system. Our objective is to attest whether different systemic risk metrics detect the same banks as systemically dangerous institutions with refer to a sample of European banks over the time span 2004-2015. For each bank in the sample we also calculate three traditional market risk measures, like Market VaR, Sharpe’s beta and the correlation between every bank and the banking system (European STOXX 600 Banks Index). Another aim is to explore the existence of a link among systemic risk measures and traditional risk metrics. In addition, the classification results obtained by the different risk metrics are compared with the ranking in terms of systemic riskiness (for European banks) calculated by Financial Stability Board (2015) using end-2014 data and collected in its list of Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). With refer to the entire sample period, we find a good coherence of ranking results among the three different systemic risk metrics, in particular between CES and ΔCoVaR.

644,pub.1149291768,10.52227/25441.2022,,,,Insurance business diversification and systemic risk,"Risk diversification regarding business lines with imperfectly correlated cash flows can reduce the financial distress risk of an institution due to coinsurance effects. Therefore, business diversification might also lower systemic risk from a “domino” perspective, in which the financial distress of an institution causes financial contagion risks to other institutions that result in systemic risk. The underwriting of risks by insurers is typically considered not systemically risky by itself, providing the basis for the diversification of insurance business lines to potentially reduce systemic risk. Since life and non-life insurance lines generally show substantially different underwriting characteristics, this paper studies if the diversification of both insurance business lines can create a financially stabilizing diversification effect, therefore reducing systemic risk. By means of a theoretical portfolio model and empirical analysis, the findings suggest that diversified insurers engaging in both insurance lines have, on average, a lower contribution to systemic risk than monoline life and non-life insurers. More specifically, insurers with a business allocation in the range of 54% life insurance are, on average, associated with the lowest contribution to systemic risk. These findings have practical implications for the design of macroprudential insurance regulation, which currently neglects the financially stabilizing potential of the diversification of both insurance business lines.",,,Journal of Insurance Regulation,,National Association of Insurance Commissioners,"0736-248X, 0736248x",,2022,2022,2022,,,,,Closed,Article,"Regele, Fabian","Regele, Fabian ()",,"Regele, Fabian ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149291768,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

METHODS: OA patterns were studied in 809 patients with knee or hip joint replacement due to OA in 4 hospitals in southwest Germany. Participants had a standardized interview and examination. Radiographs of the contralateral joint as well as both hands and a blood sample were obtained. Serum cholesterol levels were divided into tertiles and hypercholesterolemia was defined as > or = 6.2 mmol/l or use of antihyperlipidemic drugs. According to the presence or absence of radiographic OA in the contralateral joint, participants were categorized as having bilateral or unilateral OA. If radiographic OA of different finger joints was present, participants were categorized as having generalized OA. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of serum cholesterol with OA patterns were calculated with logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of participants with radiographs had bilateral OA and 26% generalized OA. No association was observed between hypercholesterolemia and bilateral OA. Hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.06-2.47) and high serum cholesterol levels (3rd versus 1st tertile: OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.02-2.92) were independently associated with generalized OA. This association was almost exclusively due to participants with knee OA.
CONCLUSION: These data add to the evidence regarding the independent role of serum cholesterol as a systemic risk factor for OA. The discrepant associations observed for different OA patterns are likely due to the relative weight of other risk factors.",,,The Journal of Rheumatology,,,"0315-162X, 1499-2752",Aged; Cholesterol; Female; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Male; Middle Aged; Osteoarthritis; Risk Factors; Statistics as Topic,1998-09,1998,,1998-09,25,9,1827-32,Closed,Article,"Stürmer, T; Sun, Y; Sauerland, S; Zeissig, I; Günther, K P; Puhl, W; Brenner, H","Stürmer, T (Department of Epidemiology, University of Ulm, Germany. til.stuermer@medizin.uni-ulm.de); Sun, Y (); Sauerland, S (); Zeissig, I (); Günther, K P (); Puhl, W (); Brenner, H ()",,"Stürmer, T (University of Ulm); Sun, Y (); Sauerland, S (); Zeissig, I (); Günther, K P (); Puhl, W (); Brenner, H ()",University of Ulm,grid.6582.9,Ulm,,Germany,,,,,,113,12,2.57,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083314963,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,Aging; Arthritis; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Osteoarthritis; Pain Research,Musculoskeletal,2.1 Biological and endogenous factors,,,"A01 Clinical Medicine; A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",,dims

An empirical analysis,"Correlated default factors and systemic risk are clearly priced in credit portfolio securities such as CDOs or index CDSs. In this paper we study an extensive CDX data set for evidence of whether correlated default factors are also present in the underlying CDS market. We develop a cash-flow-based top-down approach for modeling CDSs from which we can derive the following major contributions: (1) Correlated default factors did not matter for CDS prices prior to the financial crisis in 2008. During and after the crisis, however, their importance increased strongly. (2) We observe that correlated default factors primarily impact on the CDS prices of firms with an overall low CDS level. (3) Idiosyncratic risk factors for each single CDS play a major (minor) role when the CDS premia are high (low).",,,Review of Derivatives Research,,Springer Nature,"1380-6645, 1573-7144",,2015-02-17,2015,2015-02-17,2015-10,18,3,191-224,All OA; Green,Article,"Koziol, Christian; Koziol, Philipp; Schön, Thomas","Koziol, Christian (Department of Finance, University of Tübingen, Nauklerstr. 47, 72074, Tübingen, Germany); Koziol, Philipp (Deutsche Bundesbank, Wilhelm-Epstein-Str. 14, 60431, Frankfurt, Germany); Schön, Thomas (Department of Finance, University of Tübingen, Nauklerstr. 47, 72074, Tübingen, Germany)","Koziol, Philipp (Deutsche Bundesbank)","Koziol, Christian (University of Tübingen); Koziol, Philipp (Deutsche Bundesbank); Schön, Thomas (University of Tübingen)",Deutsche Bundesbank; University of Tübingen,grid.478692.6; grid.10392.39,Frankfurt am Main; Tübingen,; ,Germany; Germany,,,,,,3,0,,1.22,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/102298/1/797124225.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023645195,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Exposures to real estate play a major role explaining this relationship: Banks with larger real estate betas exhibited higher levels of systemic risk during the crisis. The impact of real estate betas on systemic risk increases for larger banks, following aggressive credit growth policies in the presence of housing bubbles. We show that the relationship between bank characteristics and risk could also be detected using measures of systemic risk calculated prior to the financial crisis.",,"Banks’ traditional source of funding is represented by customers’ deposits. High switching costs and the presence of government insurance makes banks’ deposits a stable source of funding particularly during periods of crises (Kim et al. 2003; Shleifer and Vishny, 2010). Deposits are, however, usually a less flexible source of funding than wholesale markets’ financing such as mortgage bonds, repurchase agreements and commercial paper. Financial market investors—being relatively more sophisticated than retail depositors—could in principle provide useful market discipline (Calomiris and Kahn, 1991). At the same time, the recent financial crisis pointed also to a “dark side” of market funding underlying some limitations on the monitoring ability of wholesale investors for systemic risks during certain periods (Huang and Ratnovski, 2011; Gorton and Metrick, 2012). The third group of regressors is concerned with the structure of on-balance sheet funding. It accounts for reliance on short-term wholesale funding, measured as the ratio of short-term marketable securities to total assets, and more traditional retail deposit funding, also relative to total assets. Customer deposits tend to provide funding stability to banks and reduce the probability of a bank rescue. In contrast, the use of short-term marketable securities increases the probability of distress (Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga, 2010). It appears that those institutions more reliant on short-term market funding are more exposed to liquidity risk during the crisis, as it becomes problematic to roll over short-term debt to finance illiquid assets. These findings corroborate recent country evidence (Hahm et al. 2013) and proposals to strengthen anticyclical liquidity regulations such as the use of liquidity charges (see for instance, Brunnermeier et al. 2012a; Perotti and Suarez, 2011).",Journal of Financial Intermediation,,Elsevier,"1042-9573, 1096-0473",,2017-10,2017,,2017-10,32,,29-44,All OA; Green,Article,"Altunbas, Yener; Manganelli, Simone; Marques-Ibanez, David","Altunbas, Yener (Bangor University, Bangor Business School, Hen Goleg, Bangor University, College Road, L57 2DG, Bangor, UK); Manganelli, Simone (European Central Bank, Directorate General Research, Financial Research Division, Sonnemannstraße 20, 60314, Frankfurt am Main, Germany); Marques-Ibanez, David (European Central Bank, Directorate General Research, Financial Research Division, Sonnemannstraße 20, 60314, Frankfurt am Main, Germany)","Marques-Ibanez, David (European Central Bank)","Altunbas, Yener (Bangor University); Manganelli, Simone (European Central Bank); Marques-Ibanez, David (European Central Bank)",European Central Bank; Bangor University,grid.466644.2; grid.7362.0,Frankfurt am Main; Bangor,; Gwynedd,Germany; United Kingdom,,,,,,40,20,,17.16,,https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/20151171/2017_Realized_Bank_Risk_during_the_Great_Recession_August_9_2017.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091431827,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Therefore, economic policy measures were necessary and advisable, but they should not take the shape of isolated and selected interventions. Rather, these measures of financial market supervision and regulation had to be integrated into a comprehensive concept of micro- and macroeconomic policy in order to allow the creation of stabilizing trust. In his contribution, Jan Pieter Krahnen maintains, that the systemic risk of banks and financial institutions has changed and risen in recent years. According to his view, this is due to a more widespread use of credit derivatives. Although they may cause a more efficient distribution of credit risk in the banking sector, at the same time they could mean a higher vulnerability of the banking sector to system-wide contagion effects of credit risk. As such, financial market supervision as well as the Basel II rules on Capital Standards should take into account not only the credit risk exposure of individual financial institutions, but also correlation measures of their share prices. For Thomas Gehrig, empirical anomalies demonstrate the relevance of awareness and trust in financial markets. This note would argue in favor of social policies that enhance public awareness in financial markets as a basis for trust. And so naturally, these policies need to be complemented by a strong financial order that aims at minimizing behavioral risks. He says, trust requires a regulatory framework that reduces manipulation by private as well as public interests. A competitive order complemented by strong regulatory oversight may go a long way towards generating liquid financial markets and the creation of trust. Trust by individuals, however, would be most strongly encouraged when individuals are entrusted in managing their own financial market activities including their own pension arrangements.",,,Zeitschrift für Wirtschaftspolitik,,De Gruyter,"0721-3808, 2366-0317",,2006-04-01,2006,2016-05-11,2006-04-01,55,1,45-69,Closed,Article,"Theurl, Theresia; Krahnen, Jan Pieter; Gehrig, Thomas P.","Theurl, Theresia (Universität Münster, Centrum für Angewandte Wirtschaftsforschung, Am Stadtgraben 9, D–48143 Münster); Krahnen, Jan Pieter (Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität Frankfurt, Mertonstrasse 17–21, D-60054 Frankfurt (Main), Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Professur für Kreditwirtschaft und Finanzierung,sowie Center for Financial Studies, Mertonstrasse 17–21, D-60054 Frankfurt (Main)); Gehrig, Thomas P.

At variance with the classical concept of trials, a clinical epidemiological interest came first: The comparison between drugs was considered a main target of the investigation only within that broader framework, and was explicitly formulated as the direct confrontation between two concepts or two generations of thrombolysis. A selective, highly efficient, and specific new thrombolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is compared with streptokinase with the expectation that the more selective approach could enhance the benefits of specificity, drastically limiting the systemic risks aspects (hemorrhagic complications).

The interactions and opinion formation of the noise traders are described by an extended O(n) vector model, which generalizes the Ising model used previously in ABMs with a single risky asset. Efficient rejection-free transition probabilities are derived to describe realistic investment decisions at the microlevel of individual noise traders. The ABM is validated by testing for several characteristics of financial markets such as volatility clustering and fat tails of the distribution of returns. Furthermore, the model is able to account for the development of endogenous bubbles and crashes. We distinguish three different regimes depending on the traders' propensity to imitate others. In the subcritical regime of the O(n) vector model, the traders' opinions are idiosyncratic and no bubbles emerge. Around the critical value of the O(n) vector model, cross-sectionally asynchronous bubbles emerge. Above the critical value, small random price fluctuations may be amplified by noise traders herding into a given asset, which then impels fundamentalists to reequilibrate their more valuable portfolios that have become unbalanced, thus pushing the prices of the other assets upward. The resulting transient increase of the momenta of these assets triggers a reorientation of the noise traders' portfolios that further amplifies the burgeoning bubbles. We have thus identified a mechanism by which the cautious risk-adverse contrarian rebalancing strategy of fundamentalists leads to systemic risks in the form of cascades of bubbles spreading the whole financial market.",,,Physical Review Research,,American Physical Society (APS),2643-1564,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-10,2023-01-01,5,1,013009,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cividino, Davide; Westphal, Rebecca; Sornette, Didier","Cividino, Davide (Politecnico di Torino, Department of Applied Science and Technology, Corso Duca Degli Abruzzi 24, 10129, Turin, Italy); Westphal, Rebecca (ETH Zürich, Department of Management, Technology and Economics, Scheuchzerstrasse 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland); Sornette, Didier (ETH Zürich, Department of Management, Technology and Economics, Scheuchzerstrasse 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland and Institute of Risk Analysis, Prediction and Management, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen 518055, China)",,"Cividino, Davide (Polytechnic University of Turin); Westphal, Rebecca (ETH Zurich); Sornette, Didier (ETH Zurich; Southern University of Science and Technology)",ETH Zurich; Polytechnic University of Turin; Southern University of Science and Technology,grid.5801.c; grid.4800.c; grid.263817.9,Zurich; Turin; Shenzhen,; Piemonte; ,Switzerland; Italy; China,,,,,,0,0,,,4.0,http://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.013009,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154369762,51 Physical Sciences,,,,,,C16 Economics and Econometrics,,dims
240,pub.1122006171,10.2139/ssrn.3471892,,,,Extended Shareholder Liability for Systemically Important Financial Institutions,"Regulators generally have tried to address the problems posed by the excessive risk-taking of Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) by placing restrictions on the activities in which SIFIs engage. However, the complexity of these institutions makes such attempts necessarily imperfect. This article proposes to address the problem at its very source, which is the incentives that SIFI owners have to push for excessive risk-taking by managers. Building on the traditional rule of “double liability,” we propose to modify the current (general) rule limiting the liability of SIFI shareholders to the amount of their initial investments in such companies. We propose replacing the extant limited liability regime with a new system that imposes additional liability over and above what SIFI shareholders already have invested in a pre-set amount that varies with a SIFI’s centrality in the financial network. Our liability regime has a number of advantages. First, by increasing shareholder exposure to downside risk, it discourages excessive risk-taking. At the same time, by placing a clearly defined ceiling on shareholders’ total liability exposure, it will not obliterate shareholders’ incentives to invest in the first place. Second, the liability to which shareholders are exposed is carefully tailored to the level of systemic risk that their institution creates. Thus, our rule induces shareholders to account for the negative externality SIFIs can impose without unduly stifling such financial institutions’ role within the financial system and in the wider economy. Third, as the amount of liability is clearly defined ex ante using the rigorous tools of network theory, our rule minimizes the influence of interest groups and the impact of idiosyncratic government decisions. Last, as markets know in advance the amount of liability to which shareholders are exposed, our rule favors the creation of a vibrant insurance and derivative market so that the risk of SIFIs defaults can be allocated to those who can better bear it.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2019,2019,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Romano, Alessandro; Enriques, Luca; Macey, Jonathan R.","Romano, Alessandro (Yale Law School); Enriques, Luca (University of Oxford Faculty of Law; European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI)); Macey, Jonathan R.

Findings indicate that through crisis years, macroprudential indicators contribute to potential systemic risk more than prudential indicators.

We present a deep learning approach for detecting relevant discussion in text and extracting natural language descriptions of events. Supervised by only a small set of event information, comprising entity names and dates, the model is leveraged by unsupervised learning of semantic vector representations on extensive text data. We demonstrate applicability to the study of financial risk based on news (6.6M articles), particularly bank distress and government interventions (243 events), where indices can signal the level of bank-stress-related reporting at the entity level, or aggregated at national or European level, while being coupled with explanations.

We aim to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods that rely on restricted modeling and are difficult to tap into various data resources. To this end, this paper unifies a dynamic quantification framework for systemic risk and links it to a two-step supervised learning problem, which allows for hierarchical structure of the systemic event and the return dependence. We leverage the generalization and predictive powers of machine learning to statistically model the tail events and the co-movements of the equity returns during the shocks to the macro-economy. Our results show that most machine learning algorithms enhance the systemic risk measure's predictive power. Numerous comparative and sensitivity backtesting studies for United States and Hong Kong markets are conducted, from which we recommend the best machine learning algorithm for systemic risk measurement.",,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,Elsevier,1556-5068,,2020,2020,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Liu, Ruicheng; Pun, Chi Seng","Liu, Ruicheng (Nanyang Technological University (NTU) - School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences); Pun, Chi Seng (Nanyang Technological University (NTU) - School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences)",,"Liu, Ruicheng (Nanyang Technological University); Pun, Chi Seng (Nanyang Technological University)",Nanyang Technological University,grid.59025.3b,Singapore,,Singapore,,,,,,0,0,,0.0,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129479657,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning",,Generic health relevance,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,,dims

In contrast, the sector remains underserviced in low and middle-income economies. Penetration of agricultural insurance exceeds 1 percent in developed economies but in low and middle- income countries, the agricultural insurance penetration is less than 0.3 percent. The gap between the penetration of non–life insurance and agricultural insurance increases as development status decreases. The purpose of this research work is to outline lessons from developed economies on how capacity building for agriculture insurance is done.
 Methodology: Relevant books references and journal articles for the study were identified using Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria entailed papers that were not over five years old.
 Findings: The study findings showed that insurance company’ in enveloped economies sell crop insurance policies through financial institutions or cooperatives, which are particularly important in marketing crop hail insurance. It was also found that in the developed economies, there is a national climate change policy as a means of capacity building for agriculture insurance. This policy helps the government to plan for training of staff and policymakers on how to advise farmers to take agricultural insurance. This policy also help in enhancement of the administrative and technical capacity of government institutions responsible for handling climate change related issues that affect agriculture insurance  
 Recommendations: The study recommend policymakers in developing countries to focus on imperfections on the pricing of agricultural insurance products. This will help policymakers designing public support programs aimed at reducing the cost of insurance thus developing insurance products that are attractive and affordable to farmers and financially viable and sustainable for insurers. The study also recommend developing countries to embrace modern insurance pricing approaches that are based on the credibility theory such as the experience-based approach. This approach has been promoted in several developed countries to cover systemic risks because it allows for the adjustment of the expected loss based on additional credible information such as insured losses of other products. The study further recommend developing countries to promote insurer- insured partnerships.",,,American Journal of Agriculture,,AJPO JOURNALS,2790-5756,,2022-08-01,2022,2022-08-01,,4,1,89-109,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Kajwang, Ben","Kajwang, Ben ()",,"Kajwang, Ben ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://ajpojournals.org/journals/index.php/AJA/article/download/1139/1244,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149924916,44 Human Society; 4404 Development Studies; 4407 Policy and Administration,,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,,dims

Macroeconomic stability and economic reforms, especially capital market and financial liberalization, created attractive conditions for banks which were looking for economies of scale and worldwide growth. At the same time governments hoped that foreign bank penetration would provide a solution to the need to increase capital within the system, as well as representing an insurance against systemic risk. The efforts to attract foreign investment coincided with the strategy of the leading players to become global banks. Now that the initial penetration has been achieved, it is worth analyzing what the impacts have been on the performance of the financial system.

A few years later, it is doubtful to what extent these reforms have been implemented and had the expected outcome. Due to the fact that the main “players” in this market are just a few big banks alongside the vast market capacity and the high trade volume, OTC derivatives markets could threaten the stability of the whole financial system.

It goes even further and suggests that Blockchain technology offers a safe environment for OTC derivatives to be traded and envisions that creation of a global and interconnected derivatives network through the utilization of the Internet of Things.

Risk management methodology is used to address or mitigate their impact in the management of construction projects. In recent years, in the fields of architecture and construction, the likelihood of risks is increased due to the increasing structural complexity, the volume of construction works of the project, the application of new and complex construction methods. However, experience with risk management has shown limited practical impact on the development of systemic risk management in the construction project. Information modeling (BIM) technologies play an important role in risk management during the design, construction and maintenance phases of a building facility. Based on the development of information technologies, risk management should be integrated with modern IT processes of construction project management. Since BIM implementation for risk management of construction projects is still limited, the BIM system implementation must be developed to address risks throughout the construction project lifecycle. This article discusses the applications of BIM for building risk management during the lifecycle of a project. These recommendations illustrate the use of BIM in risk identification, response and monitoring. The findings show that one of the most significant issues is the lack of regulations to align BIM with risk management in the project development and execution process. The development of regulations should cover the model of risk migration, cycles of risk management, flexible structure of the risk management service at all stages of the life cycle of the construction project.",,,Issues of Risk Analysis,,JSC FPH Business Express,"1812-5220, 2658-7882",,2020-06-30,2020,2020-06-30,,17,3,56-65,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Vereshchagin, V.

Nevertheless, it is only able to capture a limited view of macula and does not show leakage.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the retinal microvasculature using OCT-A in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as the association of OCT-A characteristics with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and systemic risk factors.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, observational study was conducted from January 1 to June 30, 2016, at medical retina clinics at the Singapore National Eye Center among 50 patients with type 2 diabetes with and without DR (n = 100 eyes). We examined the retinal microvasculature with swept-source OCT-A and a semiautomated software to measure the capillary density index (CDI) and fractal dimension (FD) at the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep retinal vascular plexus (DVP). We collected data on histories of patients' glycated hemoglobin A1c, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and renal impairment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CDI and FD at the SVP and DVP for each severity level of DR and the association of systemic risk factors vs the CDI and FD.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) glycated hemoglobin A1c of the 50 patients (26 men and 24 women; 35 Chinese; mean [SD] age, 59.5 [8.9] years) was 7.9% (1.7%). The mean (SD) CDI at the SVP decreased from 0.358 (0.017) in patients with no DR to 0.338 (0.012) in patients with proliferative DR (P < .001) and at the DVP decreased in patients with no DR from 0.361 (0.019) to 0.345 (0.020) in patients with proliferative DR (P = .04). The mean (SD) FD at the SVP increased from 1.53 (0.05) in patients with no DR to 1.60 (0.05) in patients with proliferative DR (P < .01) and at the DVP increased from 1.55 (0.06) in patients with no DR to 1.61 (0.05) in patients with proliferative DR (P = .02). For systemic risk factors, hyperlipidemia (odds ratio [OR], 9.82; 95% CI, 6.92-11.23; P < .001), smoking (OR, 10.90; 95% CI, 8.23-12.34; P < .001), and renal impairment (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.80-4.81; P = .05) were associated with reduced CDI, while increased glycated hemoglobin A1c (≥8%) (OR, 8.77; 95% CI, 5.23-10.81; P < .01) and renal impairment (OR, 10.30; 95% CI, 8.21-11.91; P < .001) were associated with increased FD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Optical coherence tomographic angiography is a novel imaging modality to quantify the retinal capillary microvasculature in patients with diabetes. It can be potentially used in interventional trials to study the effect of systemic risk factors on the microvasculature that was previously not accessible in a noninvasive manner.

complexity of several phenomena. Unfortunately, such an approach is often made
difficult by the large number of variables to take into consideration. Methods
of dimensional reduction are useful tools to rescale a complex dynamical
network down to a low-dimensional effective system and thus to capture the
global features of the dynamics. Here we study the application of the
degree-weighted and spectral reduction methods to an important class of
dynamical processes on networks: the propagation of credit shocks within an
interbank network, modelled according to the DebtRank algorithm. In particular
we introduce an effective version of the dynamics, characterised by functions
with continuous derivatives that can be handled by the dimensional reduction.
We test the reduction methods against the full dynamical system in different
interbank market settings: homogeneous and heterogeneous networks generated
from state-of-the-art reconstruction methods as well as networks derived from
empirical e-MID data. Our results indicate that, for proper choices of the bank
default probability, reduction methods are able to provide reliable estimates
of systemic risk in the market, with the spectral reduction better handling
heterogeneous networks. Finally we provide new physical insights on the nature

Such mergers could enable tying and bundling strategies that foreclose competition, enable price discrimination, or soften competition among firms. These theories of harm have gained new prominence as large digital firms increasingly expand into new markets, leading to specific concerns about digital platform envelopment and the creation of product ecosystems. However, the consideration of potential conglomerate effects should be balanced with the strong potential for efficiencies and the limited empirical evidence of harm. This paper sets out some key indicators of potential harm (especially an absence of effective competition in one market and entry barriers, economies of scale or network effects in the other), as well as the challenges authorities face in terms of evidence gathering, meeting standards of proof and assessing dynamic competition effects. Despite these challenges, authorities may wish to retain an openness to assessing conglomerate effects given their potential impact in some cases, particularly in digital markets.

The complex network based on information analysis provides an effective tool for analyzing the system risk between networks. This paper takes China as an example and takes the provincial urban investment bonds as the object for research. The regional network constructed with the interest rate data of urban investment bonds represents the overall systemic risk of these bonds. The main conclusions are as follows: provincial nodes in western and central areas (underdeveloped areas) are more important in the system, and they are more easier to form debt defaults. For an interconnected urban investment bond network, the higher the default risk of an individual, the greater the risk of the entire system.

Few studies have addressed the role that systemic risk factors play in the progression of atherosclerosis from one arterial tree to another.
METHODS: We studied 344 consecutive patients with suggested coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent combined coronary and carotid angiography during a 7-month period. Coronary and carotid disease was graded as absent-mild or moderate-severe based on the degree of stenosis of these vessels. Traditional vascular risk factors were compared for patients with moderate-severe CAD alone versus patients with moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease.
RESULTS: Moderate-severe CAD alone was found in 162 patients and moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease was found in 100 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension (P = .007, odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.9), history of smoking (P = .06, odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.4), and diabetes (P = .09, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.9-2.8) were associated with combined moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease. Patients with combined moderate-severe CAD and carotid disease were significantly more likely to have at least 2 of these 3 risk factors (P < .001) than patients with moderate-severe CAD alone.
CONCLUSION: An accumulating burden of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are important in the progression of atherosclerosis from the coronary to the carotid circulation.",,,Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases,,Elsevier,"1052-3057, 1532-8511",,2005-07,2005,,2005-07,14,4,182-185,Closed,Article,"Ehtisham, As’ad; Chimowitz, Marc I.; Furlan, Anthony J.; Lafranchise, E.

However, economic and financial structures as well as the pattern of shocks may differ substantially across regions, while a range of specifications is desirable to check robustness. Accordingly, in this paper we test the implicit pooling assumption in earlier multivariate work on Early Warning Systems using both logit and binary recursive tree specifications separately for crises in Asia and Latin America, as well as the pooled sample. Results suggest markedly different crisis determinants across regions, implying global samples are inappropriate.",We thank Ray Barrell and an anonymous referee for suggestions and advice.,,Review of World Economics,,Springer Nature,"0043-2636, 1610-2878, 1610-2886",,2011-06-22,2011,2011-06-22,2011-11,147,4,693-716,Closed,Article,"Davis, E.

432,pub.1156129140,10.1016/j.pdisas.2023.100279,,,,Systemic risk management in India: An analytics perspective,"The rapid changes in socio-economic and environmental factors worldwide have resulted in natural and man-made disasters becoming increasingly difficult to manage. The emergence of systemic threats that are cross-border, complex, ambiguous, and uncertain in nature, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has made traditional risk management methods inadequate. Many countries, including India, are struggling to address the challenges posed by these systemic vulnerabilities, leading to unresolved policy and governance problems. This research emphasises the need for comprehensive and proactive risk management methods that can address the challenges posed by systemic vulnerabilities, rather than reactive and fragmented approaches. The research identifies crucial turning points in India's disaster management history and explores the prospects for improved disaster risk governance in the country. The report underlines good advances in disaster administration in India, but it also emphasises the need for more systemic development in overall disaster risk management. The research identifies key design principles for India's systemic risk management that can help improve disaster risk management. This understanding can aid in developing effective frameworks, policies, and strategies to control systemic disaster risks and align with major international objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",Progress in Disaster Science,,Elsevier,2590-0617,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,18,,100279,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mitra, Arunabh; Shaw, Rajib","Mitra, Arunabh (Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture 252-0882, Japan); Shaw, Rajib (Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture 252-0882, Japan)","Mitra, Arunabh (Keio University)","Mitra, Arunabh (Keio University); Shaw, Rajib (Keio University)",Keio University,grid.26091.3c,Tokyo,Tôkyô,Japan,,,,,,0,0,,,1.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdisas.2023.100279,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156129140,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",,Generic health relevance,,,,"C13 Architecture, Built Environment and Planning",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities,dims
226,pub.1149371504,10.55643/fcaptp.3.44.2022.3766,,,,REALITIES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE UKRAINIAN BANKING SYSTEM,"The paper deals with the analysis of the banking system of Ukraine. It is shown that for Ukraine the frequency and depth of crisis phenomena in the banking sector are exacerbated by the raw material orientation of the economy, underdeveloped domestic market and the circulation of foreign currency (dollarization of the economy). It should be noted that in the pre-crisis during 2006-2007, excessive mortgage lending created a ""bubble"" in the real estate market, which, comparing its devastating effects, corresponded to this phenomenon in the real estate market in the United States. Although the crisis of 2008-2009 demonstrated the vulnerability of the Ukrainian banking system to numerous economic and political upheavals, no significant changes in banking supervision took place to minimize systemic risks. Restoration of the banking system of Ukraine in 2015-2016 is generally in line with post-crisis trends to streamline the banking system and increase its efficiency in the world. At the same time, the weakness of the institutional environment makes it impossible to use both administrative tools and state development banks to increase productive lending in Ukraine. On the other hand, commercial banks will use refinancing loans instead of private-sector savings to lend. In this case, the probability of the need for financial support from banks increases, which will lead to a significant increase in public debt.Moreover, a system of vector autoregression models has been developed to research the impact of crisis periods on the performance of commercial banks in Ukraine. The simulation results (mainly the analysis of impulse response functions) allow concluding that interbank lending in post-crisis conditions recovers relatively rapidly (with a lag of two years). Lending to non-financial corporations and non-residents showed a decline and recovery only within four years after the crisis. Lending to the general government sector is growing every year, but at the same time loans to other resident sectors are declining. In addition, during the year after the crisis, the volume of deposits in the banking system is demonstrating a decrease. Other variables do not show any response to the crisis.",,,Financial and credit activity problems of theory and practice,,FinTechAlliance,"2306-4994, 2310-8770",,2022-07-10,2022,2022-07-10,,3,44,6-29,All OA; Gold,Article,"Korol, Maryna; Bazhenova, Olena; Korol, Ihor; Starchenko, Grygoriy; Bazhenov, Volodymyr; Banna, Oksana","Korol, Maryna (); Bazhenova, Olena (); Korol, Ihor (); Starchenko, Grygoriy (); Bazhenov, Volodymyr (); Banna, Oksana ()",,"Korol, Maryna (); Bazhenova, Olena (); Korol, Ihor (); Starchenko, Grygoriy (); Bazhenov, Volodymyr (); Banna, Oksana ()",,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,https://fkd.net.ua/index.php/fkd/article/download/3766/3571,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149371504,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",,,,,,"C13 Architecture, Built Environment and Planning",,dims
